3
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,720
Look,

4
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
what exactly

5
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,920
is our daughter up to?

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
She's just on her phone.

7
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Keep it down!

8
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm not talking

9
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,200
about that.

10
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Don't you remember?

11
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,600
The way we're like

12
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,320
when we're dating,

13
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,280
constantly clutching our pagers,

14
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,200
terrified of missing a single message.

15
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120
And when we got a message,

16
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
we'd just stare at it

17
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,040
and giggle like fools.

18
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,160
We need to figure out a way

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
to check her phone.

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,880
Ouch!

21
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,560
Ouch!

22
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,000
My belly hurts so badly.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,880
What's the matter?

24
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,200
I can't take it anymore.

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,360
Let me see which

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,320
punk it is.

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
Hey, I zoomed it in.

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,200
It is English for college entrance exams.

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,080
Our daughter was actually studying.

30
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,920
See, it was just your imagination.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
That day on the bus,

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,840
I saw her

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
being very intimate

34
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,360
with a boy.

35
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,520
Seeing is not always believing.

36
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,920
Maybe you saw it wrong.

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,400
What's with the drawing and the photo?

38
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,360
Photo?

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,640
They are friends.

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,800
It's normal to have a photo.

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,480
As for the drawing...

42
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,720
When I was young,

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
I drew countless beautiful girls.

44
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,000
It doesn't necessarily mean

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
I had any relationship with them.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,680
Xiao Datu, what's that supposed to mean?

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Except for you,

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,440
the others were just figure models.

49
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,720
Our little girl,

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,960
up early and staying up late,

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,920
she's been focused on ABCD.

52
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,720
How could she possibly be in puppy love?

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
Besides,

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,240
our daughter is way out of

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,400
that Ling Dong and

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
Lan Huihui's league.

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,560
Right?

58
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,480
That being said,

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,120
you do have a point.

60
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Was it really just my imagination?

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,160
Comrade Guo Ying,

62
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,600
you are just too sensitive.

63
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
Cut it out!

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Come on,

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,480
mop the floor.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,960
It's done.

67
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,640
Do it again!

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,560
Again?

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,840
Why?

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,440
Come on, have some milk.

71
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,400
Comrade Xiao,

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,440
just confess.

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,640
Have you betrayed me?

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Ma'am,

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,320
I have not.

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,920
Then what's with you and mom

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
acting all weird recently?

78
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,560
Is she aware that

79
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,680
I've been learning drawing?

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,280
Dad also has a question for you.

81
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
Let's trade.

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,640
Are you in love?

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,880
In love?

84
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,000
So,

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,840
your parents misunderstood

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,840
that we were your love interests.

87
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,320
Yeah, I didn't expect it either.

88
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,040
It was a fluke

89
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,280
that dispelled your mom's concerns.

90
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,640
So, inviting us

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,640
to have dinner at your house

92
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,160
was to test us,

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,200
to see who was your love interest,

94
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,800
right?

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,520
So, who did she think that was?

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,960
Their exact words were,

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,360
they could tell at a glance

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
that we are

99
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
real brothers-in-arms.

100
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
They should have picked me.

101
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,920
After all, I'm so cute and charming,

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,200
fun and handsome.

103
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,360
Don't flatter yourself.

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
You were excluded from the start.

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,720
Why?

106
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,640
Didn't you notice her mom's gaze?

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,480
It was fixed on me the whole time.

108
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,680
Narcissism is a disease.

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,320
You need treatment.

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
Sorry,

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
confidence is a talent.

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,640
It's not something you treat.

113
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,360
I don't have time to watch you two bicker.

114
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,240
I have to leave.

115
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
My exam is next week.

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
If I don't pass,

117
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,560
my dream of studying fine arts is over.

118
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,320
We can't let that happen.

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
We all made a pact

120
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,480
to attend Jing University together.

121
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
We can't let our hard work

122
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,280
go in vain.

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,840
What does this

124
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,840
exam cover?

125
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,680
It includes color, sketching and drawing.

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,480
Color is straightforward.

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,720
But sketching and drawing,

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm not sure what kind of

129
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
tasks will be given.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,520
Don't worry.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
Like all other exams,

132
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,080
just practice as much as you could.

133
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,240
Just practice to draw

134
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
everything around you.

135
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,840
Apprentice,

136
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,040
are we done yet?

137
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
I can't hold it much longer.

138
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm almost there.

139
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,360
Just ten more minutes.

140
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Ten minutes?

141
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,080
No way, make it three.

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,880
Seven minutes?

143
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,720
No, five minutes.

144
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
I can't hold it anymore.

145
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
Six minutes, just six minutes.

146
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,960
Hurry up.

147
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,080
Lan Jinghui,

148
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,240
hang in there.

149
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
You do have a conscience, geek.

150
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,440
Done!

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
Hey, Lan Jinghui, Lan Jinghui!

152
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,960
This is...

153
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,200
A kettle.

154
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,760
Will the exam include something like this?

155
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,600
It's all about predicting, right?

156
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,440
Just practice with everything you've got.

157
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,360
You can't overlook

158
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
any possibility.

159
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,640
Mom.

160
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,320
Hey.

161
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,560
Are you alright?

162
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,320
I'm fine.

163
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm just sorting vegetables.

164
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,480
I'll cook soon.

165
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Keep up with your studies.

166
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,680
Mr. Wang,

167
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,800
regarding the essays

168
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,360
I sent you last time.

169
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,520
Did you get a chance to read it?

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,160
This is...

171
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,040
Xu Mengyu.

172
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,080
Oh yeah, I remember you.

173
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm short on time,

174
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
so I'll be brief.

175
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
Your essays are quite good.

176
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,240
Your mother mentioned it several times.

177
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
You have a passion for literature, good.

178
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,680
But you still have a long way to go

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
before you can publish a book.

180
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Feel free to submit again next time.

181
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,520
That's all. Goodbye.

182
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,040
Mengyu?

183
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,720
You are...

184
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm Ma Mao.

185
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,360
Remember me?

186
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,160
Back in middle school,

187
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,960
I used to get tutoring in essay writing

188
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,600
from your mom.

189
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,760
Oh, you're Ma Mao.

190
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,240
It's been so long.

191
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,280
I almost didn't recognize you.

192
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,320
Yes.

193
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,520
If I hadn't been following you on Weibo,

194
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,880
I might not have recognized you either.

195
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,560
You've gotten prettier.

196
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,840
You've been following me on Weibo?

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,480
Yeah,

198
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
I was checking you on Weibo just now.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,760
I've read everything

200
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,600
that you have posted.

201
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,520
I like them a lot.

202
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,560
I've discovered that you can understand

203
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,400
someone through their writing.

204
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
I think you've got talent.

205
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,120
Thanks.

206
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,520
Actually, all that

207
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,120
was just me scribbling away.

208
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,760
Have a seat. Let's chat.

209
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,480
OK.

210
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,320
You know, I believe

211
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,920
you'll definitely

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,880
become a famous writer in the future.

213
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm signing up right now

214
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,800
to be your number one fan.

215
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,160
Have you read my articles?

216
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,080
Of course.

217
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,920
I was even thinking of leaving a comment.

218
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,400
I was worried you might not remember me.

219
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,440
Oh, right,

220
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,440
we should exchange contacts.

221
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,840
Sure, that would be great.

222
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,240
Whenever you have something new,

223
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,120
make sure to share it with me.

224
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,960
We can discuss it together.

225
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,400
I could really use someone

226
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,240
to give me feedback

227
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
on my writing.

228
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
It's been such a long time, hasn't it?

229
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Yeah.

230
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,760
You've changed so much.

231
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,320
Yeah,

232
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,440
I almost didn't recognize you earlier.

233
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,360
I only realized it was you

234
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,480
when I walked over here.

235
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
Is that so?

236
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,160
Look at you, can't wait to eat.

237
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,880
Don't eat too much meat, OK?

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,760
Why isn't Xiaohua back yet?

239
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,240
Call her and check.

240
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh.

241
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,920
She said

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
she won't be home for dinner today.

243
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,240
Isn't there no tutoring today?

244
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh.

245
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,920
Here's the thing.

246
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,080
Their coursework at school is

247
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,120
really intense lately,

248
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,040
so she said

249
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,400
she's staying at school to study.

250
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,080
Is that so?

251
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,200
Darling, what are you doing?

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,520
You said Xiaohua is studying, right?

253
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,280
I was thinking,

254
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,040
she's been studying so hard lately,

255
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm worried about her nutrition.

256
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,720
I'll bring some fish soup to her,

257
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,200
so she can get a good boost.

258
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,680
Help me with this.

259
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,760
Ah, right,

260
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,640
after I leave,

261
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
you're not allowed to eat too much meat.

262
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,080
You have a fatty liver.

263
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,840
You got it?

264
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,680
I'm taking this away. No more for you.

265
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,200
Did you hear me?

266
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,640
Sweetie, pick up the phone.

267
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,520
Please, pick up!

268
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,360
Oh, gosh!

269
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,560
Yo, yo, yo,

270
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,760
where are all of you?

271
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Where are you?

272
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,120
What are you doing?

273
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,880
Come out to eat.

274
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Eat, eat, eat!

275
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,120
I think I saw

276
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
someone very familiar.

277
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Hello, auntie.

278
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,120
Qingtian.

279
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,160
Are you done with school?

280
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Yes.

281
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,080
But I have to study in here for a while.

282
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,200
Where's Xiaohua?

283
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,120
Is she in the study room?

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,520
Right.

285
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,040
Auntie, why are you here?

286
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,880
Well, I'm bringing Xiaohua

287
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,680
some fish soup.

288
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,880
She's been studying so hard.

289
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,000
Auntie,

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,360
how about

291
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,320
I go up with you?

292
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,640
It's OK.

293
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I'll find her myself.

294
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,520
You

295
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,480
just go and focus on your study.

296
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,600
Later.

297
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,320
Why isn't she picking up?

298
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,680
Xiaohua's mom is here.

299
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,720
DEFCON 1, DEFCON 1!

300
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,960
What do we do now?

301
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,880
Others, go and stall her mom.

302
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,160
I'll go find her with Lan Jinghui.

303
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,960
Roger that.

304
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,400
You first.

305
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,520
No, no, auntie,

306
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,360
you go first.

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Auntie, are you looking for someone or...

308
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,720
No,

309
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,240
I was actually headed to

310
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,880
the study room.

311
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,720
It's such a large campus.

312
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,320
I've been having trouble finding it.

313
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,240
Oh, the study room.

314
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,120
Where is it?

315
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,720
I can guide you there, if you'd like?

316
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,640
Thank you so much.

317
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,040
No problem.

318
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,840
Please,

319
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,360
after you.

320
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,200
Thanks.

321
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
I've got it.

322
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,680
Your school is huge, huh?

323
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,120
It's alright.

324
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,240
Where is she?

325
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,200
I'm not sure.

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,120
These buildings all have

327
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
a similar look, don't they?

328
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,320
Yes,

329
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,360
because they're all in the same style.

330
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Is that so?

331
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,960
So, it's this way?

332
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,280
Actually, it's that way.

333
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,920
Oh, OK.

334
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,600
Yes, that's right.

335
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,120
It's a big place.

336
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
I'd be lost without your help.

337
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm happy to assist.

338
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,400
Hold on,

339
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,920
haven't we circled back?

340
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,800
I don't think so.

341
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,880
But

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
I remember passing

343
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,040
these same spots earlier,

344
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
and now we're back again.

345
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,720
You might be mistaken, auntie.

346
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,600
We didn't pass these before.

347
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,160
Wait,

348
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,320
It seems you

349
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,080
aren't familiar with the layout either.

350
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,040
No, I'm...

351
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,880
It's fine.

352
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,360
You go on, I'll find my way.

353
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,360
Please, auntie,

354
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,160
let me take you there.

355
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,640
It's fine.

356
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,120
Come on,

357
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,680
auntie.

358
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,200
That's fine.

359
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,800
Thanks.

360
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
It's very nice of you.

361
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,440
I appreciate it.

362
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,040
Go on with your day.

363
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,720
No, auntie!

364
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
She's heading to the fine arts building,

365
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,200
the fine arts building.

366
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,680
Where is she?

367
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,360
When will she be here?

368
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,880
Ah, she's heading this way.

369
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,800
She's coming.

370
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Quickly, quickly.

371
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,760
These stairs are filthy;

372
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,200
they need a good mop.

373
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,000
Auntie!

374
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,680
I'm so sorry.

375
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,280
Let me clean your sneakers!

376
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,000
Come on.

377
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,480
No,

378
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,000
don't worry about it.

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,960
It's fine, it's fine.

380
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,760
Stop...

381
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,440
The cloth is dirty.

382
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,720
I'll just use my hands. I'm used to it.

383
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,360
Auntie, don't worry...

384
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,120
Chen Luyang,

385
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,480
give me some water to rinse my paintbrush.

386
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,160
Hey...

387
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,000
Just keep quiet!

388
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,960
Mom,

389
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
I apologize, I was wrong.

390
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,080
What did you do wrong?

391
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,080
I shouldn't have lied to you.

392
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,400
I shouldn't have deceived you.

393
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,960
And what else?

394
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,440
That's all.

395
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,240
Why did you keep it a secret from me

396
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,160
that you were learning to paint?

397
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,240
About that,

398
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
I don't think I did anything wrong.

399
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,200
Xiaohua,

400
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm not against you painting,

401
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,800
but at this crucial moment

402
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,400
before the college entrance exams,

403
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,600
you need to concentrate

404
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,040
and dedicate yourself to your studies.

405
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,520
Learning something

406
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,240
like arts

407
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,800
will only distract you.

408
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
You're a student,

409
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
so you need to focus on your studies.

410
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,280
Prepare for the college entrance exams.

411
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,920
Do you understand?

412
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,560
I've been practicing painting because of

413
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
the college entrance exam.

414
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,040
I'm aiming for the Fine Arts College at Jing University.

415
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,840
Jing University's Fine Arts College?

416
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,880
It's a spur-of-the-moment decision.

417
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,760
You find painting fun for now,

418
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,200
but what happens when

419
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,720
your brief enthusiasm wears off?

420
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,440
It's not brief enthusiasm,

421
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,400
and it won't wear off.

422
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,680
I've thought about it very carefully.

423
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm truly committed to it.

424
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,320
Sweetie,

425
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,640
not everyone is meant to be an artist.

426
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,920
Making a career out of

427
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,760
your passion

428
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,680
is really not

429
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
a simple matter.

430
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,200
You should ask your dad

431
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
about the struggles involved.

432
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,080
At your age,

433
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
you can't possibly understand.

434
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,920
I'm aware it's not easy,

435
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,600
which is why I need to

436
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,200
dedicate more time to painting now.

437
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,800
That's the only way I'll have the skills

438
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,440
to do what I'm passionate about,

439
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
to pursue my dream!

440
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,240
You're still young.

441
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,520
You don't have the capacity.

442
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,640
You don't have the means

443
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,800
to finance your passions!

444
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,760
Do you get it?

445
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,080
Mom, I...

446
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,120
Enough, no more talking.

447
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,240
You're staying home this weekend.

448
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,280
Just stay put,

449
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,160
and you're not allowed to go anywhere!

450
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,840
No, I can't.

451
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,320
I have a proficiency test tomorrow.

452
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,280
I must attend.

453
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,560
What proficiency test?

454
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
No, nothing is allowed!

455
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,160
Just stay home and reflect on yourself!

456
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm taking your phone!

457
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,080
Darling...

458
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,200
What's wrong with you?

459
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,680
Why did you get involved in this?

460
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,000
You're ruining our daughter,

461
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,920
don't you see?

462
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,040
Dad,

463
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,960
you'll have my back, won't you?

464
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,800
Actually,

465
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,360
your mom wasn't wrong.

466
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,080
From our point of view,

467
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,920
we just want to

468
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,960
make your future path

469
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,880
smoother.

470
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,960
Xiaohua,

471
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,880
sometimes,

472
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,160
a dream is just a dream.

473
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,440
When you grow up,

474
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,080
you'll understand what we're trying to do.

475
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,040
What now?

476
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,320
Xiaohua's been grounded by her mom

477
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,520
and can't go to the exam.

478
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,880
Doesn't that mean she's quitting the exam?

479
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,240
Let's try to convince her mom.

480
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,200
That's not going to happen.

481
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
Her mom is very firm on this.

482
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,000
Or maybe we can

483
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,480
sneak Xiao Xiaohua out

484
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,720
and then distract her mom,

485
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,680
pull off a switcheroo,

486
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
a classic misdirection.

487
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,160
It sounds workable,

488
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,720
but how exactly do we execute it?

489
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,800
Like in a spy thriller.

490
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,720
This is where our

491
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
top student needs to step up.

492
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,800
But there's less than

493
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,760
three hours until the exam.

494
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,640
It's over.

495
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,040
Don't worry.

496
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,080
Our house often has

497
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,480
some electrical quirks.

498
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
There is a way.

499
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,360
What is it? How do we do it?

500
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,520
It'll all come down to our acting

501
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,280
and how well we work together.

502
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,000
Darling,

503
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,520
our daughter has been in her room

504
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,360
for so long.

505
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,560
She must be hungry.

506
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
I'll get something ready for her to eat.

507
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,760
Hold it right there.

508
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,840
Sit down.

509
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,200
Someone's at the door.

510
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,120
Ah,

511
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,200
I'll get it, I'll get it.

512
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,120
Who's there?

513
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,800
Who is it?

514
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,440
Who is that?

515
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,000
Who is it?

516
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,120
How you doing, sir?

517
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
Hiya!

518
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,480
Here's the thing,

519
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,800
the folks upstairs mentioned

520
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,680
their breaker tripped,

521
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,880
and they sent me down here to take a look.

522
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,920
What seems to be the issue at your place?

523
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh, OK.

524
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,720
You're the electrician, aren't you?

525
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,840
It's me.

526
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
Datou, who is it?

527
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,400
An electrician.

528
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,800
He's here to inspect the wiring.

529
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,880
Our house always has issues

530
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,720
with the electrical circuit, right?

531
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Please check it out.

532
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,960
What exactly is the problem?

533
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
What could be causing it?

534
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,560
OK.

535
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,840
This is your kitchen, isn't it?

536
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,520
Yes.

537
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,440
I need to check the...

538
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
OK, OK.

539
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,160
Outlet over there.

540
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,320
Follow me, this way.

541
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,800
I'll take a quick look at this outlet.

542
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,240
Hey,

543
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
I've come to help Xiao Xiaohua.

544
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,280
I know.

545
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Make sure to examine

546
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,960
the wiring thoroughly.

547
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,240
I'll test it with a voltage tester.

548
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
OK, here...

549
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,440
Where's Xiaohua at the moment?

550
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,560
She's been locked in

551
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,240
one of the rooms by her mother.

552
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,720
I'll lead you

553
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,160
to meet up with her inside shortly.

554
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,240
Alright.

555
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,480
Make sure to check thoroughly, OK?

556
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,280
What's the issue here?

557
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
It's broken.

558
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,640
Broken? what do we do now?

559
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,480
That's not good.

560
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,880
I'll have to check

561
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,560
the other rooms

562
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
in your house.

563
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,400
Got it, got it.

564
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,520
Where's your bathroom?

565
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,360
How about this.

566
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,240
We'll start with

567
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,640
the room inside first, alright?

568
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,120
I need to take a look.

569
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,840
-Take a look.
-Hold on!

570
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,400
Is it really necessary to check

571
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,320
every single room?

572
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,080
Yes, ma'am,

573
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,680
just in case.

574
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,320
Right, just in case.

575
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,040
The sooner we finish, the better, right?

576
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,840
Darling, just sit here.

577
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,720
I've got this.

578
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,320
Let me handle it.

579
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,880
Sit.

580
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
Yeah, the keys.

581
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,040
The sooner we finish, the better.

582
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,120
You just sit here and rest.

583
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,680
I've got this.

584
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,280
This way.

585
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,000
Over here!

586
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,520
This way?

587
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,080
Yes, this way.

588
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,720
Let's start with the inside room.

589
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,920
The inside room.

590
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,000
Just a quick look, that's all.

591
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,400
Let's have a look, shall we?

592
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,440
Oh.

593
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,600
What seems to be the issue?

594
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,520
Oh.

595
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,720
Where's the outlet

596
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,960
in this room?

597
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,280
It's over here, over here.

598
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,960
Over here?

599
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,840
I need to take a look.

600
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,280
Shh!

601
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,080
Lan Jinghui and the rest

602
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,760
are already outside the building.

603
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,920
Pack your stuff.

604
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,160
Your dad will cover for us.

605
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,200
I'll get you out later.

606
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Later,

607
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,440
I'll try to distract your mom,

608
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,200
and then you need to make a move.

609
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,000
Is there an issue?

610
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,880
Why is this one also broken?

611
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,840
It's broken as well?

612
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,160
What should we do?

613
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,960
Well,

614
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,720
there's another scenario.

615
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,360
It could be a leak from upstairs

616
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,800
that reached the wiring,

617
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,520
you know?

618
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,560
A leak?

619
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Right, it would cause a short circuit.

620
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,440
We should check if there's a leak

621
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
anywhere in the house, right?

622
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,520
Yes, we should take a look.

623
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,480
Let's check it out.

624
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:18,880
Check it out.

625
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
Let's see where it's leaking from.

626
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,680
Darling,

627
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,320
come on,

628
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,160
come here!

629
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,040
Take a look.

630
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,840
Right here.

631
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,760
When did it start leaking here?

632
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,320
[It's leaking!]

633
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,000
[How did it start leaking there?]

634
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,360
[Look, it's leaking.]

635
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,080
[Isn't that odd?]

636
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,960
Yeah.

637
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,080
I've never seen

638
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,920
a leak here before.

639
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,720
How did it start leaking?

640
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,320
How did it start leaking?

641
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,280
What's wrong with it?

642
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,320
It's you, it's definitely you.

643
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,920
What's happening?

644
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,560
What, what's going on?

645
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,320
Nothing.

646
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,000
Nothing's happening, darling.

647
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Xiao Datu,

648
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,720
step aside!

649
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,280
Darling!

650
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,080
Xiaohua!

651
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,840
Darling!

652
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,160
They're here.

653
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
They're here, they're here.

654
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,320
Get in the car.

655
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,320
Let's go, hurry!

656
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,960
Driver, let's go!

657
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,680
Xiaohua, Xiaohua, stop!

658
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,400
Xiaohua!

659
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,880
Mom, don't chase after me!

660
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,600
If I don't go,

661
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,840
I'll regret it for my whole life.

662
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Xiaohua, stop!

663
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,840
Xiaohua, Xiaohua!

664
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,240
Driver, stop the car!

665
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,920
Xiaohua!

666
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,720
Come back, Xiaohua!

667
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,200
Mom, are you alright?

668
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,360
I just want to ask you one thing.

669
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
If you're not allowed to paint,

670
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
will you regret it for your whole life?

671
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,640
If I'm not allowed to go,

672
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,360
I'll surely regret it for my whole life.

673
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,920
I will be responsible

674
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,520
for my dream.

675
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,840
Is this how you show

676
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,920
responsibility for your dream?

677
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,040
You didn't even bring your ID card.

678
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,720
How are you supposed to take the exam?

679
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Thank you, mom.

680
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,520
I'll do my best.

681
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,280
I definitely won't

682
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,440
disappoint you.

683
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Alright, alright.

684
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,600
Look,

685
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,840
your friends are all waiting for you.

686
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,680
Go on.

687
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,120
OK.

688
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,000
Go for it!

689
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,480
Yes.

690
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,720
Victory!

691
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,000
[All the love in the world]

692
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
[is meant to bring us together.]

693
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,840
[If there's a kind of love]

694
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,960
[that's meant for separation,]

695
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,400
[then it might just be]

696
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,960
[the love of parents for their children.]
