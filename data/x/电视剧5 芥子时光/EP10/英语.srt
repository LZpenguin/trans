Lan Jinghui didn't hand in his either.

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
When did you collect them?

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,280
I... I had no idea.

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,680
Hand it in now.

17
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
I really didn't know.

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,400
Stop pretending.

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,800
It's been standard procedure for years.

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,920

Just reflect on yourselves.

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,720

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,160

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760

Good morning, madam.

Morning class, be seated.

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,280
Guys,

39
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,960
you've all seen

40
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,000

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800
Yes.

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,080
This time, a few of you

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
have made significant progress,

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,080

48

Of course,

49

our class's overall ranking

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
has also improved a lot.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
You all did an excellent job.

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,080
Ms. Fang,

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,280
is there a reward?

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,120
Sure!

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,800
What is it?

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
I'll give each of you a set

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,360
of simulation questions as a reward.

58
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
This is

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,600
a collection of my years of

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,640

61
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
I hope you will take it seriously,

62
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,280
OK?

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,640
It never gets old, huh?

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,320
Chen Luyang, pass them down.

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,840
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,120
You did great this time. You've improved.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
I only moved up fifty places.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
If I hadn't had a rumbling tummy,

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,360
I could have done even better.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,640

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,840

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,080
After school,

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,280
go to Mr. Zhang's office.

75
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
The teachers want to see you.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,640
No problem!

77
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Ms. Fang was trying to keep it low key.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
Praising me in here isn't enough,

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,520
she has to praise me again in private.

80
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,720
Please take a look at the exam papers.

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
I have something

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,720
to let you know.

83
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,880
During this midterm,

84
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
these students

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
brought cellphones into the exam room and

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,720
are suspected of cheating.

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,640
So,

88
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,800
we asked you all to come today

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
to discuss

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,920
how to proceed next.

91
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,080
Mr. Zhang...I'll

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
make sure he receives a proper punishment.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Apologize to Mr. Zhang, now!

94
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
Sir, I was wrong.

95
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,440
I promise there won't be a next time.

96
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,480
Sorry, sir.

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,360
We were wrong.

98
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,160
Sorry, sir.

99
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
Since you've all admitted...

100
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
No, wait.

101
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
Mr. Zhang, why am I here?

102
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
I didn't cheat.

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
I just forgot to hand in my cellphone.

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,080
What did you need that for during an exam?

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,480
If it wasn't for cheating, then what?

106
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,040
I was wondering

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,320
why you did so well in math this time.

108
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,520
Come on, just admit it!

109
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Wait...

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,960
What's wrong with me doing well in math?

111
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
The other day,

112
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,960
I aced the junior high olympic questions!

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,600
Alright, stop making things up.

114
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,440
Junior high...

115
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
Why don't you show off your

116
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,840
elementary school diploma?

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
A man

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,320
should own up to his actions.

119
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
You don't believe me?

120
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,520
How could I possibly believe you?

121
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,640
You're always last in class,

122
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,040
and now you did so well.

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,760
Now we've got the phone here,

124
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,400
and the exam paper is here too.

125
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,600
What else do you have to say for yourself?

126
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,200
Mr. Lan,

127
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,560
please calm down.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,640
Since you all

129
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,440
have admitted your mistakes,

130
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
then I will announce

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,960
the school's decision on your punishment.

132
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,920
The results of these subjects

133
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,360
have all been canceled.

134
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,800
No, why cancel mine?

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
It's rare for me to do so well on a test!

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,520
I've earned it!

137
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,520
Don't interrupt Mr. Zhang!

138
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
So doing well means I cheated?

139
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,920
I'm always last in everything I do,

140
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,160
right?

141
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,120
Then why should I even bother studying?

142
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,320
You're aware that you've got a home, huh?

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Look at the time.

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,360
Where have you been?

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,440
I'm talking to you.

146
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,280
Did you hear me?

147
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
I heard you.

148
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,800
What was your attitude at school today?

149
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:45,960
Just look at

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,920
the other two students.

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
They realized they were wrong.

152
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,960
They admitted it, and that was it.

153
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,640
And you?

154
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,720
In front of so many parents, teachers,

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
and students,

156
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,280
you talked back to me.

157
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Do you even consider me your father?

158
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,080
Listen carefully,

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,560
I've got a business trip these days.

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,000
You better behave yourself

161
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,840
and don't cause any trouble.

162
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,320
I'll deal with you

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,240
when I come back from the trip.

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Why were you yelling?

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
Can't you speak nicely?

166
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,920
Jinghui,

167
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,560
it's OK now.

168
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's eat.

169
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,760
Grandma, I don't have an appetite.

170
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,880
Jinghui...

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
You...

172
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,760
We'll now take attendance.

173
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Ling Dong.

174
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,640
Here.

175
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,800
Chen Luyang.

176
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm here.

177
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,760
Xiao Xiaohua.

178
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,520
Here.

179
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,680
Lan Jinghui.

180
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,440
Where is Lan Jinghui?

181
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,560
Ma'am.

182
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
Lan Jinghui didn't show up.

183
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,240
Didn't show up?

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,680
This is unacceptable.

185
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,880
Ma Yiming.

186
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,640
Here.

187
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,920
Xu Chao.

188
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,480
Here.

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,640
Xu Mengyu.

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,120
Here.

191
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,720
[Lan Jinghui, are you coming tomorrow?]

192
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,800
[I'll bring you breakfast.]

193
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
[Duncie,]

194
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,040
[the cafeteria has fried chicken lately.]

195
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,520
[If you don't come, you'll miss out.]

196
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,360
[Jinghui, when are you coming back?]

197
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,040
[The basketball team can't be without you.]

198
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,400
Hey, you guys!

199
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,920
Lan Jinghui is going to be expelled.

200
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,080
For real?

201
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,880
Yeah,

202
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,600
Skipping classes, cheating.

203
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,280
No way,

204
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
Jinghui can't possibly be expelled.

205
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,000
Of course it's possible.

206
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
Which of the things Li Ruosi said

207
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,320
does not apply to him?

208
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,720
Correct,

209
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
as a student,

210
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,640
it's his job

211
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,800
to focus on his studies.

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,400
This is really dangerous for him.

213
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes.

214
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Yeah.

215
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
Say that again?

216
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Is this the way to talk about a classmate?

217
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,760
You're too cold-blooded.

218
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,480
Exactly.

219
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,440
I'm just worried about him.

220
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,720
Just worry about yourself.

221
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,400
No,

222
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,840
I have to find him.

223
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,440
I have to persuade him to come back.

224
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,840
I'll buy him good snacks.

225
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,680
I'll stop by his place every day

226
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,760
to bring him breakfast.

227
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,480
Xiaohua,

228
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
is that going to work?

229
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,640
I...

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Ling Dong,

231
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,680
do you have any ideas?

232
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,840
Yeah,

233
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,280
Ling Dong,

234
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,400
you got any good ideas?

235
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,640
Well,

236
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,800
just relax,

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,160
I'll go and talk to Ms. Fang.

238
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,640
OK, I got it.

239
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,840
Here's the thing.

240
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,760
His class advisor

241
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,440
and all the staff from

242
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,240
student affairs

243
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,520
are trying to contact him,

244
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,640
but they couldn't reach him.

245
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,840
Please

246
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,840
don't worry.

247
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,520
Alright,

248
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,040
you're out of town.

249
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,440
I don't think you can be of assistance.

250
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,640
Once I've got anything,

251
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,200
I'll let you know.

252
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,600
OK, later.

253
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,400
This kid is so

254
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
hot-headed.

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,680
He cheated and thought it was justified.

256
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,600
He cheated and didn't show up at school.

257
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,640
Mr. Zhang,

258
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,840
it hasn't been cleared up yet.

259
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,880
What if we wronged him?

260
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
How could we have wronged him?

261
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,120
I've told you so many times.

262
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,600
Lan Jinghui, Ling Dong.

263
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,760
You keep a close eye

264
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,520
on these two kids.

265
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
I didn't handle this right.

266
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,480
Start making calls. Find him.

267
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,360
How's it going?

268
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,560
How is it?

269
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,560
How did it go?

270
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,120
One moment.

271
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,400
I'll be right back.

272
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Mr. Zhang, Ms. Fang.

273
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,120
Why are you here?

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,720
I can prove

275
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Lan Jinghui didn't cheat.

276
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,560
Ms. Fang,

277
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,280
I've been tutoring him

278
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,920
recently.

279
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,280
These are his own work.

280
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,320
It's indeed Lan Jinghui's handwriting.

281
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,600
Especially these competition questions,

282
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,080
he could get them all right.

283
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,040
So I don't believe he would cheat.

284
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,560
He is fully capable

285
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,240
of earning those scores

286
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,160
on his own.

287
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,920
It seems Lan Jinghui has indeed

288
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,040
been putting effort into it.

289
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,080
I told you we might

290
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,960
have wronged him.

291
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,320
You, just go back.

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,880
We'll discuss this after we find him,

293
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,640
alright?

294
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,800
Sir,

295
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,080
he might not be

296
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,400
in good spirits right now.

297
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
He's in bad spirits?

298
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,600
What right does he have to be moody?

299
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,120
Ling Dong,

300
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,360
I got it,

301
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,520
and I understand his position.

302
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,760
Don't worry.

303
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,000
Mr. Zhang and I

304
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,280
will certainly ensure

305
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,840
justice for Lan Jinghui.

306
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,960
Just go back to class for now.

307
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,040
Where on earth could he be?

308
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,040
I don't know either.

309
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,600
He's not picking up calls

310
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,280
or responding to texts.

311
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,200
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

312
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,360
Maybe he's just sleeping in at home.

313
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,960
That's not possible.

314
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,640
I called his grandma.

315
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,840
Even she didn't know he didn't show up.

316
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
Let's not complicate this.

317
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,480
So where could he possibly be?

318
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,040
It's him.

319
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,840
Yo, Jinghui,

320
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,040
if you didn't call back,

321
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,080
I was about to call the police.

322
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,120
Put it on speaker, speaker.

323
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,040
Speaker.

324
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,120
[Don't bother the police.]

325
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
I'm perfectly fine.

326
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm calling just to let you know

327
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,040
not to worry.

328
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,560
I'm glad you're OK.

329
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,280
If you're fine,

330
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
why didn't you show up at school.

331
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,880
Why bother if I'm always last?

332
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,040
Then,

333
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,960
tell us where you are,

334
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,760
we'll come to you after school.

335
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,680
Nah, don't come here.

336
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
I've got something urgent.

337
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,960
Peace out!

338
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,480
Bravo!

339
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,160
Awesome!

340
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Good job!

341
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,080
Neat!

342
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,880
Come on, that was awesome!

343
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,680
You're good!

344
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,480
Really.

345
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,520
Incredible.

346
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,440
Lan Jinghui,

347
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,000
let's rematch.

348
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,640
Didn't we just finish the race?

349
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
What's the point of rematch?

350
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,120
Hey, let's have another round.

351
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,680
Don't you understand Mandarin Chinese?

352
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,000
I said,

353
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,440
forget about rematch.

354
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,160
You won't win even if we go for 11 rounds.

355
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,400
Say that again if you dare!

356
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,840
I said,

357
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
even if we go for 11 rounds,

358
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
or even 100 rounds,

359
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,080
he will still lose to me.

360
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,040
Come again? I dare you!

361
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,200
You're so screwed.

362
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,400
You want to fight me, huh?

363
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,000
Come on!

364
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,520
Stop!

365
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,920
Lan Jinghui,

366
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,120
what's this madness?

367
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,440
Lan Jinghui?

368
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,120
Lan Jinghui,

369
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,520
why didn't you show up at school?

370
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,600
What does it have to do with you?

371
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,320
It becomes my business if you're leaving.

372
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,480
I'm about to be

373
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,400
out of your life for good.

374
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,240
I'm leaving,

375
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,040
don't you get it?

376
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,040
Besides, after I leave,

377
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,120
your life will be a lot easier,

378
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,480
right?

379
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,440
It wasn't so tiring.

380
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:56,960
Never mind.

381
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,080
You've tutored me for so long,

382
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,840
and I'm still at the bottom.

383
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
You've made great progress already,

384
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,880
you know?

385
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,560
To them,

386
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,360
I'm always the same loser.

387
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:15,920
Let go.

388
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
Lan Jinghui!

389
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,160
Jinghui.

390
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,240
Lan Jinghui,

391
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,320
What's going on?

392
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,760
What's with your face?

393
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,880
Alright,

394
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,520
We've been searching

395
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,320
everywhere for you.

396
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,160
Let's go back to school

397
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,560
and talk this through, OK?

398
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,800
I won't go back.

399
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,440
What did you say?

400
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,760
I said I'm not going back.

401
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,000
Skipping classes and getting into a brawl,

402
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,560
you think you're in the right, huh?

403
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,480
Mr. Zhang,

404
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,880
it's not entirely his fault.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
After all, there's a reason behind it.

406
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,320
Yeah, Mr. Zhang,

407
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,400
[anyone would feel upset]

408
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,680
[being wronged.]

409
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,480
[Exactly.]

410
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,640
[This whole thing,]

411
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,120
[it wasn't his fault from the start.]

412
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,240
[Jinghui, come back to school with us,]

413
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,880
[alright?]

414
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,520
Come on, let's go.

415
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm not going back.

416
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,880
Lan Jinghui,

417
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,040
your friends have come all this way

418
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,280
to take you back to school.

419
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,080
What more do you want?

420
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,600
Do you really

421
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,520
need to be disciplined?

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,680
Lan Jinghui.

423
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,320
You've made significant progress already.

424
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,480
Do you really want to give up so easily?

425
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Moreover, Mr. Zhang

426
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,960
just called your dad.

427
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He felt very guilty after

428
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,720
learning about the truth.

429
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,160
He wanted to make it up to you later.

430
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,560
What you're doing now is just

431
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,920
intensifying the conflict, isn't it?

432
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,440
Ms. Fang,

433
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,720
please don't

434
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
bring up my dad, OK?

435
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Right now, I just don't want to study.

436
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,600
I feel like no matter how hard I study,

437
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,040
everyone still sees me

438
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,720
as the last in class.

439
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,360
Lan Jinghui!

440
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,040
Alright, Ms. Fang,

441
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,680
I know you've wasted

442
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,760
a lot of energy on me.

443
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,240
But I think

444
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,000
there's no point.

445
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,120
[Do you realize how]

446
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,720
[serious this is?]

447
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,600
I have to discuss with the higher-ups

448
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,400
about how to handle this.

449
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,840
Can you please take this seriously?

450
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,400
Please!

451
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,360
Mr. Zhang,

452
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,680
I am serious,

453
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,840
seriously.

454
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,560
How about this?

455
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,440
Just make it quick.

456
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,080
Please expel me.

457
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:12,920
You...

458
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,320
Hey,

459
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,720
what's with this kid?

460
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,520
Mr. Zhang,

461
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,880
Ms. Fang,

462
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,240
actually, I think

463
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,600
you owe

464
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,360
Lan Jinghui an apology.

465
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,560
[Guys, now, we will discuss]

466
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,720
[the fundamentals of philosophy.]

467
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,440
[The fundamentals of philosophy]

468
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,520
[is the relationship between]

469
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,120
[thought and existence.]

470
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,520
[Different perspectives to this]

471
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
[are the sole criterion for distinguishing]

472
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,800
[materialism from idealism.]

473
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,160
[Well, the evolution of idealism,]

474
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
[has been divided into two stages:]

475
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,360
[objective idealism]

476
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,360
[and subjective idealism.]

477
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,920
[Materialism,]

478
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,120
[is divided into three forms:]

479
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,200
[the first is]

480
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,680
[naive historical materialism,]

481
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,560
[the second is]

482
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
[modern metaphysical materialism,]

483
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
[and there are dialectical materialism]

484
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
[and historical materialism.]

485
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,040
Grandma, I'm home.

486
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,040
What are you cooking? Smells good.

487
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,880
[Welcome back, Jinghui.]

488
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,320
[Look who's here.]

489
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,880
Who is it?

490
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,760
What are you doing here?

491
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,240
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

492
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,760
Hey...

493
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,000
of course, I came to visit my dear...

494
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,520
aunt.

495
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Who's your aunt?

496
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,480
Jinghui,

497
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,840
be polite talking to

498
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,760
your uncle.

499
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,560
Wash your hands and get ready for dinner.

500
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,040
Alright?

501
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,000
Does your grandma know

502
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,920
you don't want to go to school anymore?

503
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,280
Keep it down!

504
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,640
Are you coming back with me or not?

505
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,840
Who do you think you are?

506
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,880
Nope.

507
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,280
Grandma!

508
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,920
Don't you call her that!

509
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,480
She's my grandma, not yours!

510
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,240
Do you need anything?

511
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,640
No need to shout.

512
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,680
Are you hungry?

513
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,840
Come over, boys, time to eat.

514
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Alrighty.

515
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,800
Grandma, we'll be right there.

516
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,240
Watch your mouth,

517
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,720
and behave yourself.

518
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,600
Here, have some soup.

519
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,280
Thank you, auntie.

520
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
Dong, darling,

521
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,280
How has Jinghui

522
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,720
been doing at school?

523
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,520
Watch what you're saying.

524
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,000
Only tell what's necessary to her.

525
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,800
What "tell to her?"

526
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,600
Haven't you told her yet?

527
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,560
Auntie,

528
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,000
Jinghui might be

529
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,360
a bit shy,

530
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,280
so he wouldn't tell you.

531
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,120
You might not know about

532
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,080
his great deeds at school yet.

533
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,360
What great deeds

534
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,160
could he have at school?

535
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,680
Look at the corner of his mouth.

536
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,480
Jinghui,

537
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,920
show me.

538
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,240
Take your hand down and show me.

539
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,640
Let her see.

540
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,480
Let her see it.

541
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,000
Jinghui,

542
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
[Why must you cause me so much concern?]

543
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
[Got into fights again?]

544
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,600
No, no.

545
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,440
Grandma, I definitely wouldn't

546
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,320
fight with anyone.

547
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,480
Listen to me,

548
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,440
this is definitely

549
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
a misunderstanding...

550
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,120
Hey,

551
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,760
help me out here.

552
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,200
Would you mind

553
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,080
covering for me?

554
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
How should you address me?

555
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,160
Uncle...

556
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
Dear uncle, sir.

557
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,000
My uncle...

558
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,960
My uncles knows it.

559
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,040
Just ask

560
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,520
him, my uncle.

561
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Then please

562
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,760
tell me.

563
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,000
Here's the thing.

564
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,240
Jinghui loves playing basketball

565
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
and he's been training so hard.

566
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,880
He got injured

567
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,840
once during training

568
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,200
by accident.

569
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,680
He's really good at basketball.

570
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,520
Absolutely, Jinghui's

571
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,160
physical condition is top-notch.

572
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm in superior shape!

573
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,240
Yeah, he is fit.

574
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,040
Go ahead, eat,

575
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,080
and stay nourished.

576
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,480
Stay nourished.

577
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,040
Yeah, stay nourished.

578
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,000
Have some of these.

579
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,720
Here.

580
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,880
How thoughtful of you.

581
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,080
Are you coming back to school with me?

582
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,600
No, I'm not going back.

583
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,400
That won't happen.

584
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,040
Auntie,

585
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,640
something just popped up in my mind.

586
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,600
I have to let you know.

587
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,680
OK, go ahead.

588
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Once, he managed to

589
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,760
offend students from other schools

590
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
all over the place.

591
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,440
Jinghui...

592
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
Grandma, there was no such thing.

593
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,320
Grandma, that's not true.

594
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,400
Don't listen to his wild stories.

595
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,200
Hey, hey,

596
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,080
Can we talk about it after we get back?

597
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,040
Don't start with me.

598
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,440
Are you coming back or not?

599
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,680
There was no such thing, grandma.

600
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,400
We'll talk about it later.

601
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,280
Auntie, here's the thing.

602
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,000
He formed a band

603
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,880
for our school

604
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,440
and then they entered

605
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,360
a talent competition.

606
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,080
They outshone other schools and won.

607
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,880
Isn't that

608
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,160
making students from other schools

609
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,640
green with envy?

610
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,560
Our Jinghui has

611
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,560
had a knack for music since he was little.

612
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,480
Isn't he great!

613
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,760
For sure.

614
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,680
Not only is his musical talent great,

615
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,840
but he's also well-liked.

616
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,520
He's always ready to lend a hand.

617
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,120
When other students' bikes broke down,

618
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,800
he helped pump them up

619
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,000
and even provided the pump.

620
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,840
He also treated the whole class to drinks,

621
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,320
remembering everyone's

622
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,920
favorite flavors.

623
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Right?

624
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,600
I remember once,

625
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
one of our classmates

626
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,920
got pricked by a cactus,

627
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
hands full of thorns.

628
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,720
Lan Jinghui carefully

629
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,520
pulled them out one by one.

630
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,840
Right, being meticulous is the key.

631
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,920
Jinghui, sweetie,

632
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
that's doing good deeds,

633
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,360
being willing to help others,

634
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,880
helping classmates.

635
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,320
You should be commended.

636
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,800
Alright, grandma,

637
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,960
stop praising me for now.

638
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,680
I just remembered,

639
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,480
Ling Dong must have something

640
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,600
he hasn't done.

641
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,280
Let's go.

642
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,120
I'll accompany you to take care of it.

643
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
You haven't finished your dinner yet.

644
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,960
What thing do I have to take care of?

645
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,840
Yes, I remember very clearly.

646
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,880
You definitely have something. Let's go.

647
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,840
There is something.

648
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,600
Is it something at school?

649
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,440
Yes, you definitely have something there.

650
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,160
Yes.

651
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,440
Auntie,

652
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,880
I just remembered,

653
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
there is indeed something at school.

654
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,200
I have to go now.

655
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,600
I'm telling you, my dear,

656
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
you should come to our house often.

657
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,520
Any interesting stories at school,

658
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,320
Jinghui will walk me out.

659
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,080
just let me know.

660
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,800
I'd love to hear them.

661
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,000
Make sure to visit us again!

662
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,080
Hey, enough is enough.

663
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,200
Mr. Zhang has cleared things up for you.

664
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,320
It's time to go back to school.

665
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,160
Forget it.

666
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,440
Don't lie to me.

667
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,760
No one cares about me.

668
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,920
No matter how hard I try,

669
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,760
no one will notice me.

670
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,120
This is from Xiao Xiaohua.

671
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,360
Even knowing you won't return to school,

672
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,360
she still buys you breakfast every day

673
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,320
and takes notes for you.

674
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,240
When hearing someone badmouthing you,

675
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Xia Qingtian rolls up her sleeves

676
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,440
ready to beat them up.

677
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,200
And there's Ma Yiming,

678
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,440
he practices

679
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,520
basketball every day,

680
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,440
saying it's a dream he shares with you

681
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,520
and he won't give up.

682
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,960
So you see.

683
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,120
It's not that no one cares about you.

684
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,240
It's that you choose to ignore it.

685
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,800
Only she would

686
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,320
do such a silly thing.

687
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,400
Alright,

688
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,120
I've delivered the notes,

689
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,200
and I've said my piece.

690
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,160
See you tomorrow.

691
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,520
Dear nephew.

692
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,240
I've told you many times.

693
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,720
Stop calling me nephew!

694
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,400
Xiaohua,

695
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,280
do you think Lan Jinghui

696
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,520
will come today?

697
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,720
Ling Dong went to persuade him.

698
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,520
If he still doesn't show up

699
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,800
that would be really ungrateful.

700
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
Who's badmouthing me behind my back?

701
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,440
Lan Jinghui?

702
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,680
Master, you've finally returned!

703
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,360
What bad things did you say about me?

704
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,280
Master, I was just kidding.

705
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,840
Look,

706
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,920
I even brought you breakfast.

707
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,480
Well done.

708
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:38,960
Master,

709
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,120
you haven't been to class these days.

710
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,880
What do you plan to do with the teachers?

711
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,880
Ease your mind.

712
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,920
Since the great me has shown up,

713
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,800
I have a plan in place.

714
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,320
Let me see the rest.

715
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,320
Come in.

716
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,760
Lan Jinghui,

717
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,200
you've finally shown up.

718
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:16,840
Haha.

719
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,680
Everyone's here, huh?

720
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,080
I figured you'd be

721
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,800
looking for us these days.

722
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,400
So, you've sorted things out, huh?

723
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,400
Yes.

724
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,760
Regarding my...

725
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,440
Sit down. It's all good, help yourself.

726
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
No, I'm good, I'm good.

727
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,240
I'll just stand here.

728
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,160
These past few days,

729
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,520
I've deeply reflected on

730
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,400
my mistakes.

731
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:42,960
Apologies.

732
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
You don't believe me? Check this out.

733
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,480
Ms. Fang,

734
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
what is this character?

735
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,480
Hey...

736
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,280
I'm not able to recognize it.

737
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,000
This is...

738
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,960
Now I see it clearly.

739
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,640
Jing!(thornbush)

740
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,080
The "jing" from "bearing thornbush to apologize."

741
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,480
Exactly.

742
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,840
Nice attitude.

743
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,200
But,

744
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
just apologizing to me isn't enough.

745
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,640
Got it.

746
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,000
I,

747
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,560
and Ms. Fang are practically family now.

748
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,640
I understand

749
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,960
our family rules.

750
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,560
Good.

751
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,840
Lan Jinghui,

752
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,960
you've matured.

753
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,880
Now, see if his

754
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,040
self-criticism is good enough.

755
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,840
If it's not profound enough,

756
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,640
let him add a few thousand words.

757
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,960
Alright,

758
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,120
no problem.

759
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,640
OK,

760
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm just kidding with you.

761
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,240
Ms. Fang and I

762
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,000
actually forgave you a long time ago.

763
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,160
In handling this incident,

764
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Ms. Fang and I

765
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
indeed didn't grasp the full story.

766
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,320
We wronged you

767
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,320
and made you suffer a lot.

768
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,280
Today,

769
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,680
Ms. Fang and I formally

770
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,000
and sincerely apologize to you.

771
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,320
Sorry.

772
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,800
Nah, it's OK.

773
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,480
We are cool.

774
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,880
I've already forgiven you.

775
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,920
Oh, so you're Mr. Sunshine

776
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,360
now that you've got a little attention.

777
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,520
Yes, in this whole thing,

778
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,360
indeed we

779
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,920
handled it inappropriately.

780
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,560
But,

781
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
do you realize how badly

782
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,320
your skipping classes, fighting,

783
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,320
and blatantly violating school rules

784
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,440
has negatively affected

785
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,720
the school's reputation?

786
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,720
Yes, yes, I get it.

787
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,440
That's enough, Ms. Fang.

788
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Don't scare him anymore.

789
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,560
I've just discussed

790
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,480
with the higher-ups.

791
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,960
Regarding this incident,

792
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,560
your punishment is inevitable.

793
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,240
Let it serve as a lesson,

794
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,960
and don't make the same mistake again.

795
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,360
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

796
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,560
I'll keep that in mind.

797
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,560
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

798
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
I'll take my leave now.

799
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,120
You won't stick around and chat?

800
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm good, I'm good.

801
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,040
I won't make the same mistake again.

802
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,720
I'll heed the advice.

803
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,600
I'll go back and be a good boy.

804
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,520
Go back to your class.

805
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,840
Put on your jacket.

806
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,120
OK, I'm leaving.

807
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,600
Why are you here?

808
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,640
That was really silly.

809
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,320
What nonsense was that?

810
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,920
A strong man is adaptable to any situation.

811
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,880
King Goujian of Yue

812
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,600
became a winner in life

813
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,280
by doing just that.

814
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,640
I think you'd better

815
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,280
read the biographies

816
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,600
of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru.

817
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,720
You didn't just come here

818
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,800
to laugh at me, did you?

819
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,960
Do I look like I have that much free time?

820
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,840
So you're actually concerned about me.

821
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,800
Well, I'm your uncle after all.

822
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Caring for my nephew

823
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,680
is what an elder

824
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,480
should be doing.

825
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,800
No need for thanks.

826
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,800
Ling Dong!

827
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,880
Thanks.

828
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,040
For what?

829
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,080
You know what I mean.

830
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,720
You don't have to thank me.

831
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,480
You've helped me before.

832
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,440
Now we're square.

833
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,440
What are you doing?

834
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,200
Now you owe me again.
