3
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
Any news on him?

4
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,480
Ms. Fang and Mr. Zhao

5
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,560
are out looking.

6
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,280
No,

7
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,360
I need to search too.

8
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,840
Ling Dong,

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,440
hold on.

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,840
No.

11
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,960
Ling Dong?

12
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,360
Why are you here?

13
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:25,840
Ms. Fang,

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
did you find Lan Jinghui?

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,320
Not yet.

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,080
Let's wait here.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,040
If he's not back

18
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,800
by morning,

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,000
we'll call the police.

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Lan Jinghui?

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,760
Lan Jinghui?

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
You're finally back.

23
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,120
Wait, what's going on?

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
You finally decided to show up?

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,640
Do you know how worried

26
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,400
Ms. Fang was?

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,720
Where were you?

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
Why was your phone off?

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,520
I was dealing with something.

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
Where's my phone?

31
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,240
Lan Jinghui!

32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,120
Wait...

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,800
Ms. Fang, listen.

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,760
I really just

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
went for a walk.

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,960
I didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,720
Enough.

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
It's a misunderstanding.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
Knees bent!

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,040
Hands up!

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,840
Misunderstanding?

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,320
What did I misunderstand?

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,880
This is unbelievable.

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,400
Look at

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,080
the time.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,600
Do you know

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,640
how worried everyone was?

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,840
You're just wasting time.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,320
I really...

50
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,440
I warned you repeatedly.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,280
What if

52
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
something happened?

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,920
Huh?

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,320
I shouldn't have agreed

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,120
to bring you here.

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
I didn't do anything wrong, Ms. Fang.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,000
Wrong?

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
What did I accuse you of, Lan Jinghui?

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,920
Listen,

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,960
stay squatting for 2 hours.

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,840
Don't get up until then.

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,520
You're driving me crazy.

63
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,760
Calm down.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,040
Calm down.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,320
It's okay now.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
Lan Jinghui,

67
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,280
if you knew

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,280
this would happen,

69
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,760
why did you do it in the first place?

70
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,840
So, where did you go?

71
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,880
I...

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,600
I went to handle something important.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,840
Jinghui!

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,400
Jinghui!

75
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,600
Sis, why are you here?

76
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,600
Sis?

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,760
You were

78
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
into dancing that

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,040
you forgot your phone.

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,640
So, this is where you were.

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,880
You're so

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,640
forgetful.

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,560
Luckily, you told me

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,280
you were staying at this hotel

85
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,120
across from the square,

86
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
so I brought it

87
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,880
right over.

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,960
Ladies, dancing?

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
Sweet talker for your age.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,640
Patience.

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,320
After this dance,

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,440
it's partner time.

93
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
Join in then.

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,520
No, wait.

95
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,080
Stop dancing.

96
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
There's a partner dance?

97
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,120
That's right.

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,400
Let me talk to you for a second.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,480
Sis,

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,320
here's the thing.

101
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440
My friend

102
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,280
has an

103
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,560
important exam tomorrow

104
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,520
and needs a

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
quiet place to study.

106
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Can you

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,360
postpone the dancing

108
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,560
until tomorrow?

109
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,560
Sis, sis,

110
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,440
could you halt, please?

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,440
I bought some things for all of you.

112
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,560
Let them come over and get it.

113
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
Ladies, come here.

114
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,200
Ladies,

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,200
come over.

116
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,400
I bought something for you.

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,840
I got you

118
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,080
headphones.

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
Headphones for everyone.

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,160
That's high-tech. Do we need to pay?

121
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,400
No, it's free.

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,120
Everyone gets one.

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,880
How...

124
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,720
how can we dance with headphones on?

125
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,840
No problem.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
Just dance as usual.

127
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
The music

128
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,960
will play through

129
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,720
the headphones.

130
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
Silent but effective,

131
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,800
right?

132
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,640
Come on.

133
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,360
Slow down.

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,960
Everyone will get one.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Everyone will get one.

136
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Okay.

137
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,320
Ladies, I have to go now.

138
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,440
No, you stay.

139
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,800
Ladies,

140
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
I can't dance today.

141
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,600
My friend

142
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
has something important tomorrow.

143
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,800
I really

144
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
have to go.

145
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,720
Okay, okay.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,400
I was

147
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,720
looking for my phone

148
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,200
but I can't find it.

149
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,480
I realized

150
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,640
I must have left it at the square.

151
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,920
Your dancing was great.

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Come back next time.

153
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,920
Thanks to you teaching me.

154
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
Sweet talker!

155
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,840
Lan Jinghui,

156
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,120
I didn't expect

157
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,440
you were dancing.

158
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Just thinking...

159
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,200
just thinking about

160
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,640
you dancing

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,080
makes me laugh.

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,720
I... wait...

163
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Why are you two laughing?

164
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm a rising star

165
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,840
in the square dance scene.

166
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,640
All right,

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,360
stop laughing.

168
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,400
Sis, one question,

169
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,840
do you dance in the morning too?

170
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,880
Didn't you

171
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,480
give us headphones?

172
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't worry,

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,320
your friend can study in peace

174
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,880
and do well on the exam.

175
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,360
Thank you!

176
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm off.

177
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,480
Goodbye.

178
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
I'll walk you out.

179
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
We'll walk you out together.

180
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,200
[You dance really well.]

181
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,040
[Really?]

182
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,720
[Yeah.]

183
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,440
[All thanks to you ladies.]

184
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
Okay,

185
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,200
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,000
I misunderstood you.

187
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,040
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

188
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,520
Ms. Fang,

189
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,600
in that situation,

190
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
I find it hard to explain.

191
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,800
I probably

192
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,200
squatted too long.

193
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,080
My legs went numb,

194
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,600
and my brain got fuzzy.

195
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,840
Lan Jinghui,

196
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760
I've seen you playing around

197
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,680
and not looking tired.

198
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,240
And squatting for me

199
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,320
made your leges numb

200
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,960
and stiff?

201
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,560
Mr. Zhao,

202
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,600
give him

203
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
a massage?

204
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,800
All right, I misunderstood you.

205
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,840
Let me help you stretch.

206
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,200
No, it's fine.

207
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,120
I'm fine, really.

208
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,080
It's getting late.

209
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm tired and need rest.

210
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,200
I'll should get going.

211
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,680
I'll help you.

212
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,920
No need.

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,960
Let me stretch you out.

214
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,480
I'm fine now.

215
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Then I'll head up too.

216
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Ling Dong,

217
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
the hotel AC

218
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
is pretty cold.

219
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,640
Haven't you been sleeping well?

220
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm ok.

221
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,760
Never been better.

222
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,840
Seriously?

223
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,880
No way.

224
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Mr. Zhao said

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,160
he almost caught a cold this morning.

226
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,320
I'll ask

227
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,120
for more blankets

228
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
for you two.

229
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,680
Ms. Fang, you're so thoughtful.

230
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,520
Caring about us all the time.

231
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,160
Ms. Fang, I got

232
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,320
a blanket last night.

233
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,680
Wasn't that from you?

234
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,920
No, it wasn't me.

235
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,960
Did you ask for it?

236
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,280
No, not me.

237
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,600
Strange.

238
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,000
Snacks

239
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,160
and blankets.

240
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Does it offer special treatment

241
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,800
for examinees?

242
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,560
Maybe.

243
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,040
Anyway, I'm heading upstairs.

244
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,400
All right, good luck tomorrow.

245
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,560
Thanks.

246
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,920
Bye.

247
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,960
Rest well.

248
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,280
Lan Jinghui

249
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,120
seems scatterbrained,

250
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,560
but

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,880
I really misjudged him this time.

252
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,400
Yeah,

253
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
he seems mischievous,

254
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,160
but now

255
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,960
I see him differently.

256
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,400
Oh,

257
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,880
by the way,

258
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,640
have you eaten?

259
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm not hungry.

260
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
It's still early.

261
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,600
How about

262
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,800
get something to eat now?

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,440
Really?

264
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,680
You don't want to?

265
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,360
Then never mind.

266
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,040
I do.

267
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,760
Ms. Fang,

268
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,520
what do you want?

269
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,280
Anything.

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,880
What do you feel like?

271
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,400
How about spicy hot pot?

272
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,160
Sure, my treat.

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,640
Let's go.

274
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,320
Respect!

275
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,120
Well,

276
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,680
how was the exam?

277
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,960
Was it easy?

278
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,360
It was okay.

279
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,080
Hi.

280
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,320
Have a seat.

281
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
A mission impossible for me.

282
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,800
Class rep, did my sunny doll work?

283
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,240
It worked well.

284
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,800
Thanks, Qingtian.

285
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,720
No problem.

286
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,720
This is for you.

287
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:37,960
Thank you.

288
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Ling Dong, this is for you.

289
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,200
It rehydrates you.

290
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,520
Xiaohua,

291
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,440
why didn't you

292
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,200
get me a drink?

293
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,240
I've been helpful.

294
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,160
Why don't I

295
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
get to rehydrate?

296
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,600
Ms. Fang.

297
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,280
There's a vending machine.

298
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,960
Get one yourself.

299
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,760
Well, well, Xiao Xiaohua,

300
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
you've gotten bold,

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,400
talking back

302
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,240
and making faces?

303
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,880
Enough.

304
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,560
Ms. Fang has something to say.

305
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,160
Exams are over,

306
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,040
so you have

307
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
free time now.

308
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Go out and have fun.

309
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,920
But

310
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,680
be back by 8 PM,

311
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,280
understood?

312
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
Got it? 8 PM.

313
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,920
Isn't 8 PM early?

314
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,480
We can't enjoy much

315
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,960
by then.

316
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,880
So what?

317
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,560
8 PM is late.

318
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,680
How about 7 PM?

319
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,920
Or 6 PM?

320
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,200
Or

321
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,920
if you don't want to go out,

322
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,480
just tell me.

323
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,440
No, no,

324
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,080
that's not what I mean.

325
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,040
I mean,

326
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,880
8 PM is perfect.

327
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,840
Then...

328
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,000
Ms. Fang,

329
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,600
you're the best teacher

330
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,280
in the world.

331
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,880
We love you.

332
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,240
All right, enough flattery.

333
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,240
Now,

334
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,480
go have fun.

335
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,400
We're off then.

336
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,240
Goodbye.

337
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,880
Bye. Bye.

338
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,680
Have fun but stay safe.

339
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,360
Keep

340
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,960
your phones on

341
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
24 hours.

342
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes, got it.

343
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,600
Goodbye, teacher.

344
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,760
Goodbye, teacher.

345
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,000
Have fun!

346
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,280
Jing University?

347
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,320
Didn't you

348
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,640
want to see the physics lecture here?

349
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,320
Never mind,

350
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,880
it's too crowded.

351
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,880
And today's Open Day.

352
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,400
It's hard to get free tickets.

353
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,680
Knew you'd say that.

354
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Tickets?

355
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,120
Master, you're amazing.

356
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
How'd you get them?

357
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,720
Well...

358
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
Why are there so many people

359
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
at this Open Day?

360
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,760
I have the same question.

361
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,840
They were all waiting their turns.

362
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,320
If my girlfriend didn't force me,

363
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,320
I wouldn't be here.

364
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,080
What about you?

365
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,440
My friend

366
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,280
wants to apply the university next year,

367
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,560
so we're checking it out.

368
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Your friend?

369
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,080
It's super hard

370
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,680
to get in here.

371
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,680
Only a few

372
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,560
make it each year.

373
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,360
Totally.

374
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,040
I'm telling you,

375
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,840
my deskmate's here

376
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,160
for the

377
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,760
national physics exam.

378
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,240
National, you know?

379
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,120
Not everyone

380
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
can participate in this.

381
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,840
It adds points to

382
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,600
entrance exam scores.

383
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,960
Your girlfriend must be impressive.

384
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,960
It's a guy.

385
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,880
Ticket distribution starting now.

386
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,920
Don't crowd.

387
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
Register on the left, tickets on the right.

388
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,440
Next.

389
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,560
Okay.

390
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,720
Three tickets, please.

391
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,960
One per person.

392
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,120
You think

393
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,960
this small stuff

394
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
can stump me?

395
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,120
I got the tickets with different ID.

396
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,600
Master, you're amazing.

397
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,640
Without you

398
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
getting tickets early,

399
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,600
we wouldn't have

400
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,200
gotten into Jing.

401
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,000
It's nothing.

402
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,680
If you really

403
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,800
want to

404
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,400
thank me,

405
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,800
well...

406
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
my throat's dry.

407
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,880
How about a bottle of water?

408
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,480
Sure, on my tab.

409
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,080
What?

410
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,240
I'll buy it for you at school.

411
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,440
What about you?

412
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,960
Since you're aiming for Jing University,

413
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,840
I'll ramp up

414
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,960
your tutoring

415
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,880
when we're back.

416
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,920
What? No need, I think.

417
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,080
No room for discussion on this.

418
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,800
Why?

419
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,840
You're way off target.

420
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,440
[What? That's crazy!]

421
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,280
If I make it into this university,

422
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,920
my whole life's

423
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,880
gonna change.

424
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,080
Everyone here

425
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,000
just oozes energy and confidence.

426
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,760
You aiming for it too?

427
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm not gonna make it.

428
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,320
But Ling's got it in the bag.

429
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
Come on, let's check the front.

430
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
If our school had this grass,

431
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
I'd be chillin' here all the time.

432
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Take a photo of me.

433
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,760
You guys always

434
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,680
walk with all that jumping around?

435
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,520
Our version of life's journey.

436
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,480
Hey, time's ticking,

437
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,520
where's that

438
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,280
physics lecture?

439
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,760
Auditorium 2.

440
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,200
[I]

441
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,120
[scoped it out.]

442
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,840
It's over there.

443
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,560
But if we don't hustle,

444
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,360
we'll be

445
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,360
cutting it close.

446
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,240
I wanna check out

447
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,840
the Art Department.

448
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,560
We'll

449
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,520
regroup here in a bit.

450
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,960
Alright, so...

451
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,360
Sure.

452
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,160
See you later.

453
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,440
Yeah.

454
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
We're leaving then.

455
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah.

456
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,080
Let's go.

457
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,880
Hey, check it out.

458
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,280
If you order it with an iced lemon tea,

459
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
you can get 20% off.

460
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,720
Hi, there.

461
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,680
You can use

462
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,600
these coupons together.

463
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,400
Your friend gets half off.

464
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,840
Why giving it to me?

465
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,840
Toss them away.

466
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,640
These coupons are a mess,

467
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,400
I don't know how to use them,

468
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,240
so why keep them?

469
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah, it's

470
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,800
all tricks,

471
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,240
but if you play your cards right,

472
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,640
you can get the most bang

473
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,080
for your buck at restaurants.

474
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
Really?

475
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,520
Yeah.

476
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,320
Look.

477
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,960
This spot's

478
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
got its own deal,

479
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
but these two share

480
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,960
a discount.

481
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
And using

482
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,320
your phone to pay,

483
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,880
you can get

484
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,240
15 off 50.

485
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,200
How do you know all this?

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,320
They mentioned it,

487
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,840
plus it's right here on the flyer.

488
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,320
How come I missed it?

489
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,920
Basic stats,

490
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,560
that's all.

491
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,240
You're so good!

492
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Craving some takoyaki?

493
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,560
How about that sushi joint?

494
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,680
They give us

495
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,520
a free serving of takoyaki

496
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,320
when we spend over 30.

497
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,360
So we should

498
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,720
be able to eat

499
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,440
all the food you want

500
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,880
for just

501
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,320
127.8 yuan.

502
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,840
You're really impressive!

503
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,440
Why're you staring at me?

504
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,000
I ain't no takoyaki.

505
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,760
No way,

506
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,400
you're my sidekick.

507
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,280
Today, you're officially

508
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,360
in the Rooftop Crew.

509
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,120
Rooftop Crew?

510
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
What's that?

511
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,280
Anyway,

512
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,640
you're in, like family now.

513
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,160
Let's go.

514
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,080
[Don't dirty up the darker parts.]

515
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Keep the layers and depth going.

516
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,360
Nice job, Xingchen.

517
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,720
Is Professor Yang this popular?

518
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,280
Nice to meet you, guys.

519
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,080
You too.

520
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,320
[I'm delighted to]

[discussing physics with all of you.]

523
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,400
I've noticed something interesting.

524
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,120
In a lot of

525
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
sci-fi stories,

526
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,680

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,880
[good to go again.]

536
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,000
[It's almost]

537
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,840
[like a cheat code:]

538
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,480
quantum mechanics fixes everything.

539
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,040
[It speaks to]

540
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,120
[how complex]

541
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
[and elusive]

542
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,480
quantum mechanics

543
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,400
can be.

544
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,160
But don't worry,

545
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,800
I'll try to explain it

546
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,640
in a simple,

547
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,840
down-to-earth way

548
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,840
for us all to understand.

549
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,120
[About 1.3 billion years ago,]

550
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,480
two black holes

551
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,520
were merging,

552
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,080
[with masses of]

553
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,640
[36 and 29 times.]

554
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,640
[the mass of]

555
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,440
[our Sun respectively.]

556
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,200
[They were orbiting each other.]

557
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,000
The exciting news is that

558
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,680
China has designed and built

559
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,160
its very own FAST.

560
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,600
Its emergence

561
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,040
has directly usurped

562
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,120
the position of the Arecibo,

563
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,400
making it the world's largest

564
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,200
radio telescope by aperture size.

565
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,880
This marks a breakthrough

566
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,280
and rise of Chinese technology.

567
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,760
[It's a voyage]

568
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,240
[like no other,]

569
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,720
[one that will demonstrate to humanity]

570
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
[that our exploration can reach]

571
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,640
[beyond a hundred billion light-years.]

572
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,960
Xingchen.

573
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm going out for a moment.

574
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,360
Will you monitor the class for me?

575
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,320
Right.

576
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,480
Remember everyone,

577
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,520
once you're done painting,

578
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,640
chill for a sec.

579
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,480
Step back, give it a good look,

580
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,080
and maybe squint a bit.

581
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,480
[That way, any out-of-tune spots]

582
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
[will pop right out at you.]

583
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,880
Hi.

584
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,960
What's your major?

585
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
I... I don't...

586
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm just here for a visit.

587
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,120
An art student?

588
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,640
No...

589
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,680
I saw your painting,

590
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,960
your color sense is really good.

591
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,240
Not many

592
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
art students can pull that off.

593
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,760
Thank you.

594
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
Come with me.

595
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,360
About ten years ago,

596
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,400
humans observed the Higgs Boson

597
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,920
for the first time.

598
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,280
I'd like to

599
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
ask you,

600
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,160
what do you think

601
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,560
is the difference

602
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,840
between it and gravitational waves?

603
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,000
The student who's nodding off,

604
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,160
yes, you there.

605
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,040
You must think

606
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,760
my question is too easy

607
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
to pique your interest.

608
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:26,800
[Well, then,]

609
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,120
[I'll ask you to answer it for me.]

610
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
What were we talking about?

611
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,680
I lost track of it.

612
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,960
Einstein predicted the existence

613
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,480
of gravitational waves a century ago,

614
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,960
while Higgs predicted

615
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
the Higgs Boson half a century ago.

616
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
The Higgs Boson

617
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,920
is crucial

618
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,040
to the Standard Model,

619
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,680
but it also

620
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,240
comes with many

621
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,200
limitations and uncertainties.

622
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,680
[The discovery of gravitational waves,]

623
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,080
[on the other hand,]

624
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,560
[is like opening a telescope for us,]

625
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,240
[allowing us to use it]

626
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
as a cosmic probe

627
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,600
in the future

628
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,800
to explore even

629
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,240
more about the universe.

630
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,560
Are you from our physics department?

631
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,520
Not yet.

632
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,800
Alright.

633
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,400
I hope to

634
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,840
[see you again]

635
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,800
in my class someday.

636
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,080
You will, professor.

637
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,840
Okay.

638
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,560
Let's continue with the lecture.

639
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,440
I never knew we could paint like this.

640
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,680
Painting's all about

641
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,160
expressing yourself,

642
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,600
so go wild with it.

643
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
College is about

644
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,280
learning the rules

645
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,640
and then breaking them,

646
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,560
pushing past what's normal.

647
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,120
It's amazing to be in this space.

648
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
I bet the artists whose work

649
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,240
is displayed here are all super skilled.

650
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
You've got a natural gift.

651
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Ever considered taking up art?

652
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,480
I...

653
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
I can't.

654
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,120
Why?

655
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,400
My mom doesn't want this.

656
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,600
so

657
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,080
I'll stick to it as a passion

658
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,720
project.

659
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Let me ask you,

660
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,040
why do you enjoy painting?

661
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
When I was little,

662
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,000
my dad worked at an art museum,

663
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,120
and I'd always tag along

664
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,800
when he went to work.

665
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,920
While he was busy,

666
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,400
I'd roam around the galleries,

667
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
and those paintings

668
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,560
on the walls

669
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,520
became a part of my childhood memories.

670
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
That's how I fell in love with painting.

671
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,320
Whether I'm happy

672
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
or sad,

673
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,880
I use my pencil to capture it all.

674
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,720
You see,

675
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,680
every painting here

676
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,440
is a world

677
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,760
created by the artist.

678
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,120
Just like you,

679
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,040
they use painting to express

680
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,360
their understanding of this world.

681
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,080
Has anyone ever told you

682
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,880
that you're a talented painter?

683
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,240
Isn't Lan Jinghui here yet?

684
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah.

685
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,760
You have a great talent for painting.

686
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,960
But I think he's just

687
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,440
being nice.

688
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,400
And seeing

689
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
these paintings

690
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,640
just makes me feel

691
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,160
even more inadequate.

692
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,480
Someone once told me that

693
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,520
there's no such thing

694
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
as a genius,

695
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,880
most people are ordinary.

696
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,160
The difference between those

697
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,560
who seem like geniuses

698
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,040
and ordinary people

699
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,560
is that they strive

700
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,600
to do their best

701
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,560
in everything,

702
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,760
while the latter

703
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,760
often think they can't.

704
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,960
Nothing

705
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,720
in this world

706
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,080
comes easy.

707
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,440
And remember,

708
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,240
the brush of life

709
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,600
is in your own hands. Give it a shot

710
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,360
or you'll never know what you can do.

711
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,600
Come here.

712
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,240
This is for you.

713
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,040
I hope this comes in handy for you.

714
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Thank you.

715
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,440
This

716
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,400
art gallery's

717
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,280
pretty well-known.

718
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,760
Need me to snap a pic of you

719
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,520
as a souvenir?

720
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
No need.

721
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,560
Why?

722
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,880
I think I'll be coming back here again.

723
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,240
Bye.

724
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,680
Looking forward to seeing you

725
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,960
as my classmate next time.

726
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,840
It's you.

727
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,760
It started raining all of a sudden.

728
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,720
What's this?

729
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,880
Admission info and

730
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,160
brochures for Jing University.

731
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,680
Put it in my bag.

732
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,360
Okay.

733
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,520
I've decided!

734
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,520
I'm aiming for Jing University.

735
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,440
Xiaohua.

736
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,680
Telling my dad

737
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,040
I wanna go to JU

738
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,960
was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

739
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,800
It's not because of you.

740
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,520
I've discovered

741
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,000
my passion here at

742
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,240
Jing University.

743
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,840
I really hope you can

744
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
stand by me and support me.

745
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,120
Getting into

746
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
the Art Academy of JU is tough.

747
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,560
[Sure.]

748
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,000
Xiaohua, I'm on your side.

749
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,240
But

750
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,960
if you can dream it,

751
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
you can do it.

752
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,320
Yes.

753
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,960
The brush of life

754
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,200
is on my own hands.

755
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,840
Give it a shot.

756
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,360
Alright.

757
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,600
I'm in!

758
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,680
Let's all apply for JU.

759
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,120
Well, I...

760
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,560
Come on, don't deny it.

761
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,680
Your eyes lit up like Christmas trees

762
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,200
the moment you arrived at JU.

763
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,240
Yeah, Ling Dong.

764
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,680
You're destined for

765
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
JU's Physics Dept.

766
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
Who else could fill your shoes?

767
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,240
Hey, slow down!

768
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,200
You're leaving me with nothing to say,

769
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,040
huh?

770
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,080
So we've got a deal then?

771
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,760
Deal.

772
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,560
Yes, deal.

773
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,240
Jing University,

774
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,640
we're on our way!

775
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,800
Jing University,

776
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,200
we're on our way!

777
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Jing University,

778
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,120
we're on our way!

779
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,640
[As I uttered those words,]

780
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
[it felt like I had sprouted wings.]

781
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,640
[I could hear them flapping.]

782
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,920
[Looking down at the campus,]

783
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
[I felt this rush of power.]

784
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,480
[The road's gonna be tough, but]

785
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,240
[I'm gonna keep going and make it big.]

786
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,600
[Lan, Ling,]

787
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,400
[let's go for it!]

788
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,880
I'm so full.

789
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,640
So full.

790
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,880
Bye.

791
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,440
Bye.

792
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:34,920
Bye.

793
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,840
Bye. Good night.

794
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,480
Good night.

795
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,080
Good night.

796
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,800
Bye.

797
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,320
Hi.

798
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,960
Hey, I gotta say,

799
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,480
the AC in here

800
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
is blasting

801
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
and I'm freezing

802
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,320
at night.

803
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,760
I apologize for the inconvenience.

804
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,480
But the AC

805
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,280
is set to

806
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,400
a uniform temperature.

807
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,200
Let me see if I can

808
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,560
get you an extra blanket instead.

809
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,680
Yeah.

810
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,040
Could you please also

811
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,160
send one to room 2069?

812
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,640
Please make sure not to forget 2069.

813
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,240
Sure.

814
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,400
While you're at it,

815
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,880
could you add room 2070

816
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,440
to the list and

817
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,160
send a blanket there too?

818
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,480
Okay.

819
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,160
Thanks.

820
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,480
If Ling's cold, Chen must be too.

821
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,440
Let's go.
