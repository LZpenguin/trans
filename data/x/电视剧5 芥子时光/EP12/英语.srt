00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,240
Yu, you've got to eat.

4
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Mom, I'm not hungry.

5
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,880
Saw you didn't take notes in physics class.

6
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,480
Take mine, and copy it down.

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,560
[You're welcome.]

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Inside.

11
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Nice, nice!

12
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,640
Good job!

13
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520

14
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,440
Good.

Create space!

16
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,360
Why didn't you catch my pass?

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,280
Yo!

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,080
Come on, pass the ball!

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,640
Ma Yiming.

20
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,320
Ma Yiming!

21
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,680
You two still haven't reconciled?

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,600
Let's not bring up this subject.

23
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
I don't know when that punk

24
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
became so stubborn.

25
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,040
What's that saying?

26
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,160
Something begins with "L"  clouds judgment.

27
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
So what do we do now?

28
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
The best way to solve this

29
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,120
is to find evidence

30
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,040
to prove that someone else is responsible.

31
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,120
But how?

32
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,160
Shh!

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,720
Right now, anyone

34
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
that we see around us

35
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,200
could be the perpetrator.

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,720
We need to find

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,880
someplace quiet.

38
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,800
Since that article was posted on the

39
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
bulletin board early in the morning,

40
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,360
does that mean the perpetrator

41
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,360
posted it in the middle of the night?

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
Even if we know

43
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
it was posted in the middle of the night,

44
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,840
we still can't

45
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,120
pinpoint the perpetrator.

46
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,600
There's another way.

47
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,320
What is it?

48
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Xu Mengyu said she didn't

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,360
bring too many samples to school,

50
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,800
so she definitely knows

51
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,720
who she gave them to.

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,800
We just need to

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,480
find those people

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,080
and see who's missing

55
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,760
the page that was plagiarized,

56
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,560
and that will be our guy.

57

[Mengyu,]

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
[we've been waiting for you to come back.]

59
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,040
[Mengyu,]

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
[I've taken all the notes for]

61
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
[today's classes for you.]

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,440

63
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,120
[if you need to talk, I'm all yours.]

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,200
[are you coming today?]

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,760
[Mengyu,]

67
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
[will you be back tomorrow?]

68
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,880
[Mengyu,]

69
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
[I'm at the subway exit near your house.]

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,160
[Can we meet?]

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,800
Mengyu.

72
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
OK,

73
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,680
what is this about?

74
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
I just wanted to see you.

75
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
Now you've seen me.

76
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,040
You may leave.

77
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Xu Mengyu,

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520
I heard you'll transfer to another school.

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,160
Could you please stay?

80
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,440
What does that have to do with you?

81
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,760
Once when I was in my freshman year,

82
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,640
I told the teacher that

83
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,600
my homework was blown away by the wind.

84
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,120
Actually, I didn't do it.

85
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,240
And there was another time I came in late.

86
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,840
I told the teacher my stomach hurt.

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,680
Actually, I didn't get up in time.

88
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
Also, during an exam,

89
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,040
I looked at someone else's answers...

90
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,280
So you're saying,

91
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,680
plagiarism is no big deal, right?

92
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm trying to tell you,

93
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,480
everyone makes mistakes.

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,320
We did in the past,

95
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,760
and we will in the future.

96
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
We'll make many, many mistakes.

97
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,400
If we make mistakes, we acknowledge them,

98
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,200
and we stop making them again.

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
No big deal.

100
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,080
Am I right?

101
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,320
A single mistake

102
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,720
is not a lifelong stain.

103
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
If

104
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,560
you're aware you've made a mistake

105
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
and still continue to hide

106
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
and avoid facing it,

107
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
then that's truly shameful.

108
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
You should go home.

109
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,320
[Dear faculty and my fellow students]

[of Chenjun High School,]

00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
[I am Xu Mengyu.]

to apologize to you all.

114
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm sorry, I plagiarized.

[All these days,]

116
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,880
[I've been asking myself]

117
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
[what the meaning of my writing is.]

118
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,640
[Is it for the]

119
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,160
[so-called vain praise,]

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,840
[or to express myself?]

121
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,400
[But in the glory and praise,]

122

[I lost my true self.]

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
[I lost myself.]

[But I'm fortunate that]

[to find my true self again.]

[There are no shortcuts to success.]

128
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,400
[I can only put in double efforts.]

129
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,000
[I've let down everyone]

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
[in the student union,]

131
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
[and set a bad example for all of you.]

132
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,400
[So starting today,]

133
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,440
I'll resign from

all my positions in the student union.

135
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,760
I apologize again to all the students

137
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm truly sorry.

138
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
Mengyu is back.

139
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,480
You're back.

140
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Mengyu!

141
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,080
Mengyu, you're finally back!

142
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,400
Where have you been?

143
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
I thought you transferred.

144
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
You really scared me, you know?

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
It's OK. I'm back now, aren't I?

146
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,240
It's good you're back.

147
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,600
So good...

148
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,520
I'll help you with your backpack.

149
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,800
Hello, everyone.

150
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,960
I'm back.

151
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,120
Xu Mengyu,

152
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,080
you misunderstood Xiao Xiaohua.

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,720
She's not a

154
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
two-faced person.

155
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
If you really want to find the one

156
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
who stabbed you in the back,

157
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,560
it's simple.

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,760
This is Xiao Xiaohua's book,

159
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,280
and it's intact.

160
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,320
The missing page is page 35.

161
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,560
Whoever's is missing it, did it.

162
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Mine is here!

163
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,360
Who else has got it, bring out yours.

164
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,080
Good thing I brought mine.

165
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,880
Page 35, I've got it.

166
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,200
I brought mine too.

167
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
I wasn't given one at all.

168
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,800
Then the rest of you,

169
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,640
bring out your books.

170
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,440
Let's take a look.

171
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
Please stop!

172
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,120
I don't want to know who that is.

173
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,120
Why?

174
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,680
Have you heard what's

175
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,560
been going around about you?

176
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,920
Because I am aware of it,

177
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,640
I don't want that person

178
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,400
to go through

179
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,200
what I've been through.

180
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Whether it was me

181
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,040
or not,

182
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,480
nothing will change now.

183
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,960
And Mengyu

184
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,120
has paid the price

185
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,920
for her mistake.

186
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
I agree with Xiaohua.

187
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,520
That person hasn't done anything wrong.

188
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,080
I'm the one at fault.

189
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
Even if he hadn't exposed all this,

190
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
I would still have been wrong.

191
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,080
Let's put an end to this.

192
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,720
Mengyu, welcome back.

193
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,120
Mengyu,

194
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,320
glad you're back.

195
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
Mengyu, welcome back.

196
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,480
Xu Mengyu, it's good to have you back.

197
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
Welcome back.

198
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,480
Welcome back.

199
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,200
Do you remember what you told me

200
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
on the rooftop last time?

201
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,440
Yes.

202
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
Actually, last time on the rooftop,

203
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,640
I was so scared that

204
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,840
this would be discovered by others.

205
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
I was scared every day.

206
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,280
I was scared that the lie

207
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,560
would be exposed someday.

208
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,320
The more I hid,

209
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
the more I lost the courage to confess.

210
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,160
But you came back anyway.

211
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,280
So,

212
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,200
you're not a coward.

213
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,840
I thought when I came back this time,

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
everyone would blame me,

215
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,720
look down on me,

216
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,720
but I didn't expect them to

217
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,160
accept me again.

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,360
I was quite surprised

219
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,640
and touched.

220
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,320
Sometimes the hardest thing

221
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,440
is actually your own inner struggle.

222
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,920
When you muster the courage

223
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,440
to take that step,

224
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,640
you'll find that things aren't as scary

225
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,280
as you imagined.

226
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,440
I also want to say

227
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,160
sorry to you.

228
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,080
I've wanted to tell you this for a while,

229
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
and today I finally said it.

230
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,920
You're right,

231
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,840
taking this step

232
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,880
doesn't seem as hard as I thought.

233
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,000
Xiaohua,

234
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,000
have you ever thought

235
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,720
that if we don't find out

236
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,640
who that perpetrator is,

237
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,920
everyone might think

238
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
you're the two-faced person

239
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,080
who drove Xu Mengyu away?

240
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,960
Then for the rest of this term,

241
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,080
both of us

242
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
will be affected by you.

243
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,080
Hey!

244
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,280
So you two

245
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,880
were actually not doing this for me,

246
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,240
but for yourselves?

247
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,320
Isn't that obvious?

248
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,040
I have no idea

249
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,520
what's going on with

250
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,400
your thought process.

251
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,160
I knew that you two

252
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,520
were doing this for me,

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,720
but I believe that person

254
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
didn't have any ill intentions.

255
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,480
He just didn't have the courage

256
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,880
to point it out.

257
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,000
Actually, I was the same.

258
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,200
I was also aware that

259
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,440
Xu Mengyu plagiarized,

260
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,080
yet I chose not to speak up.

261
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,320
So what are you,

262
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,360
if not a saint?

263
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,160
I don't care if this is saintly

264
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,120
or whatever.

265
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
I just did

266
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,720
what I thought was right.

267
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,320
Everyone has their own way

268
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,840
of dealing with problems.

269
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,640
It might not be right,

270
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,760
and you might regret it,

271
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
but who knows?

272
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,040
Being accepted is easy,

273
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,040
but sometimes,

274
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,080
being disliked for being yourself

275
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,600
also takes courage.

276
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,600
Alright then,

277
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,400
no matter what comes next,

278
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,640
I will firmly stand by

279
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
your side, apprentice.

280
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,200
So will Ling Dong.

281
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,760
I have my doubts on this,

282
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,800
but still,

283
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
I'm willing to stand by your side.

284
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,160
Xiaohua, I'm sorry.

285
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,160
Ling Dong,

286
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,160
sorry to you as well.

287
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,320
Yo, aren't you apologizing to me?

288
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,680
We're buddies. That won't be necessary.

289
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,840
[Finally escaped from]

290
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,160
[the cage that bound me,]

291
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,400
[shattered the mask,]

292
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,880
[and found that cowardly self.]

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
[For the first time, I felt]

294
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
[the breeze on my face]

295
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,480
[also had a sweet taste.]

296
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
[Let's get to know each other again.]

297
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,560
[Hello, Xu Mengyu.]

298
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
[You were meant for something great.]

299
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,720
[You just need to endure some hardship.]

300
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
[Keep it up, Xu Mengyu.]

301
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,840
Dream Rider?

302
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,840
Stay focused, guys.

303
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
Look at you.

304
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,480
Aren't you usually quite noisy

305
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,480
and active in the classroom?

306
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,040
Why are you all so lethargic out here?

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,120
I have an announcement.

308
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,960
The basketball tournament

309
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,040
has been scheduled,

310
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,200
and it's next week.

311
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,520
Sir, our PE classes

312
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,000
have all been replaced by other classes.

313
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,200
How are we supposed to train for it?

314
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,360
It would be like asking for humiliation.

315
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Hey, you are a teenager.

316
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,680
Man up, OK?

317
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,080
For such an energetic

318
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,240
and passionate sport,

319
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,680
is there anybody willing to step up

320
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,520
and organize for it?

321
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
Finals are coming. You won't have time.

322
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,120
No volunteers. I'll appoint someone then.

323
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,920
Lan Jinghui.

324
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,440
Here!

325
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
You and Ma Yiming will be

326
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,720
in charge for the task.

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,480
Aye aye, sir!

328
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,120
Guys, feel free to exercise on your own.

329
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,080
Alright, fellas,

330
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
our school's basketball tournament

331
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,840
is coming soon.

332
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,440
Let me briefly explain the rules.

333
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,680
The participants in this tournament

334
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
will include students from

335
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
all classes in Grades 10 and 11.

336
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
Each class will field five players.

337
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
If there are not enough players,

338
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,720
you will be considered a forfeit.

339
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,640
The tournament will be knockout-based.

340
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,640
In a moment, we will draw lots to decide

341
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,600
who your opponents will be.

342
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,120
Any questions?

343
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,280
No!

344
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,880
If not,

345
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,760
let's start drawing lots.

346
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,160
Yours first.

347
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,280
Dismissed!

348
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,800
Yo, Lan Jinghui,

349
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,680
these are all you've got?

350
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,720
Didn't you hear the teacher?

351
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,600
If the players are not enough,

352
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,120
it's considered a forfeit.

353
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,200
How embarrassing would that be?

354
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,960
How about this,

355
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,440
just withdraw from the tournament.

356
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,400
Just save yourselves the embarrassment

357
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,240
for not having enough players.

358
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,120
Bi Peng, for your information,

359
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
even though we're short on numbers,

360
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,640
any one of us

361
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
could beat all of you

362
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,440
by dribbling with

363
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,720
just a pinky,

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,800
like this.

365
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,960
If you're short on numbers, just admit it.

366
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
Why pretend to be a big shot?

367
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,960
If you don't make to the preliminaries...

368
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,160
Alright,

369
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,440
just give your best shot.

370
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,440
Don't get eliminated in the first round.

371
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,680
If that happens, our teams won't be able

372
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,320
to face each other during the finals.

373
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,200
Save your bluffs,

374
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,080
or, you'll embarrass yourselves later.

375
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,200
What's the smell?

376
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,440
Do you smell it?

377
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,920
There's a cumin smell.

378
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,760
Do you smell it?

379
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Seems like there is.

380
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,760
You reek, dude!

381
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,640
Cut the bull!

382
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
I was not BSing.

383
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,160
Hey pal,

384
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,840
there's no denying that

385
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,360
playing basketball is exhausting,

386
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,400
You've got to attend to your hygiene.

387
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,960
Exactly!

388
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,880
Exactly.

389
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,400
That's not good.

390
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,360
Attend to it.

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,640
Right?

392
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,200
Apply some bleach.

393
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,440
Bleach wouldn't be effective.

394
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,800
[He's got to use disinfectant.]

395
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,640
[That works too.]

396
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,440
[Goodbye,]

397
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,280
[barbecue boy.]

398
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,960
[He's cumin boy.]

399
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,760
No smell.

400
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,680
[That works too.]

401
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,200
Jiang Jing,

402
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
would you consider being a forward?

403
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
A forward

404
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,040
is someone being

405
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,000
at the very front

406
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,520
in our basketball team.

407
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,400
I really have to work on this problem.

408
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,400
Hey, Chen Yu.

409
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,480
What's up, Jinghui?

410
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,840
About the point guard position,

411
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,600
what do you say?

412
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,800
Let me tell you...

413
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,280
Jinghui,

414
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I might have a stomachache later.

415
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,480
Hey!

416
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,120
Jinghui,

417
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,920
I'm starting to feel it.

418
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm starting to feel it, man.

419
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,600
It hurts so bad.

420
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,520
Wu,

421
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,040
even though you're wearing glasses,

422
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,640
I could tell that you're capable of...

423
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,640
Hey, Wu,

424
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,720
where are you, Wu?

425
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,000
Wu?

426
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,920
Mo Fei,

427
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,040
I know you are...

428
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,560
Jinghui,

429
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,840
You were just looking for Wu, right?

430
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
You should have told me earlier.

431
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll help you find him.

432
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,560
[Where did you go, Wu?]

433
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,600
[Wu?]

434
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,400
[Zhu Ming...]

435
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,440
[Yo, Wu!]

436
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,640
[Wu?]

437
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,040
Ruosi.

438
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,960
I remember the advisor

439
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
asked me to do something.

440
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,560
[I forgot.]

441
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:12,960
[It should be...]

442
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,920
Her office is that way.

443
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,520
No one is man enough!

444
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,040
Don't look at me. I don't play.

445
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,360
I'll teach you.

446
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,360
I can teach you, right?

447
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,880
I'll teach you hands-on.

448
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,280
Nope. Not interested.

449
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,480
Let me tell you,

450
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,720
playing basketball

451
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,720
first of all, it shapes up your body,

452
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
and it has many tricks,

453
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,200
many moves,

454
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,640
and it's very flexible.

455
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,680
Did you do your homework?

456
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,320
No.

457
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,880
These are

458
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,160
irrelevant, OK?

459
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,560
So, I'm telling you,

460
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,560
you've got to

461
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
learn to play basketball with me.

462
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,080
I'll...

463
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,000
I'll guide you.

464
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,840
I'll guide you, OK?

465
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
I'll teach you hands-on.

466
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,200
Hey, seriously,

467
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm not going to

468
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,160
charge you for it.

469
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,240
Ling Dong,

470
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,200
can you help me with this problem?

471
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,320
I've already substituted the formula,

472
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,200
still, I couldn't work it out.

473
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,840
You've confused the two formulas.

474
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,880
The formula for vertical upward throw

475
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,000
and the formula for free fall

476
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,640
are not the same.

477
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,000
Take a closer look at the variables.

478
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,960
OK.

479
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,840
Have you completed your tasks today?

480
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,000
He's asking you.

481
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,240
Have you completed your tasks?

482
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,200
No.

483
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,280
I haven't completed the tasks at all.

484
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:42,840
The basketball tournament

485
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,520
is coming soon,

486
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,640
and our team is still two players short.

487
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,880
There's no hope for us.

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,480
What should I do?

489
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,360
There's a solution.

490
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,160
What is it?

491
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,760
How about this?

492
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,640
Finish memorizing

493
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,280
today's English vocabulary.

494
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,480
Roger that, sir!

495
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
Apple, fair,

496
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,120
limit, tie,

497
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,360
complete, correct,

498
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,920
cosmos, complete,

499
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,800
thumb, smoker...

500
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,440
Xu Chao,

501
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,360
I remember you were

502
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,040
on the basketball team last year.

503
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,560
Are you interested in joining

504
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,440
our class's basketball team?

505
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,880
I have to study.

506
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,600
The finals are coming up.

507
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,960
I've got no time for the game.

508
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,760
Got it. I know it all too well.

509
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,480
The top student's notes,

510
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,520
containing a secret speculation sheet,

511
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,560
only one copy available.

512
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,000
Really?

513
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,000
Really.

514
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,560
Just a basketball team, right?

515
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,160
I'm in!

516
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,040
Come on!

517
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,320
What do you want?

518
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,400
Jian Zhiqiang,

519
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,800
186 cm tall,

520
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,800
nickname "Optimus Prime,"

521
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,760
represented your school

522
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,680
in city-level competitions

523
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,720
in junior high.

524
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,880
With such good records,

525
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,200
and such a good look,

526
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,680
it'd be a pity for you to skip center.

527
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,360
I won't play.

528
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,640
I'm burnt out from studying lately.

529
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,320
Why wouldn't I

530
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,120
go for some online games?

531
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,880
I will join you in Star Leaping.

532
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,640
Honor of Kings?

533
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,920
Not interested.

534
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,040
I'll personally play with you,

535
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,480
and lead you to the highest rank.

536
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,840
I'll be with you for the rest of the term.

537
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Plus a bottle of coke every day.

538
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,920
Deal. Show up to training every day.

539
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,760
No problem.

540
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,000
I hereby declare,

541
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,640
the basketball team of Class 5, Grade 11

542
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,720
is officially established.

543
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,680
Good!

544
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,760
They are so cool, so handsome!

545
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
Hurry up and check them out!

546
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,560
We are right here!

547
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,320
Where are you guys going?

548
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,720
Class 1 has formed a 188 cm tall boy band.

549
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
The girls are going to see them.

550
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,400
What?

551
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,000
Those

552
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,960
traitors!

553
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,280
You guys all have excellent taste!

554
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,440
Hurry up, Xiaohua,

555
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,840
My shoelaces were loose.

556
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,160
Let's go, hurry.

557
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
Hurry up, charge!

558
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,640
188 cm boy band,

559
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,200
I'm coming!

560
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,680
I'm coming!

561
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,840
I didn't expect Xiao Xiaohua

562
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,840
to be like this as well.

563
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,360
They're all 188 cm tall.

564
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,960
So what?

565
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,520
They look good but they suck!

566
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
We are the ones with real skills.

567
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Exactly!

568
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,480
We can't let them look down on us.

569
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,000
Right.

570
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,560
But for the future training,

571
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,560
we'll have to rely on you, Jinghui.

572
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,320
Don't worry, leave it to me.

573
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,640
I, the great me, have mastered

574
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,160
all the basketball moves.

575
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,400
Bravo!

576
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,720
I'll work on a problem first.

577
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,080
Not focusing on self-study.

578
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,240
What are you doing?

579
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,040
[Your noisy chatter]

580
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,120
[filled the]

581
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
[entire hallway.]

582
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,960
[It was like non-stop.]

583
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
I now announce,

584
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,960
those who failed more than three subjects

585
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,280
in the last exam are not

586
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,120
allowed to participate in the tournament.

587
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,000
No, no, sir.

588
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,200
Isn't that unreasonable?

589
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,120
What's unreasonable about it?

590
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,360
No, last time...

591
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,920
[What's the duty of a student?]

592
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,320
[Answer me.]

593
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,920
Study.

594
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,080
Sit down.

595
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,120
[The finals are coming up.]

596
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
[Stay focused, guys.]

597
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,040
[Give everything you've got.]

598
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,760
[Xiao Xiaohua, I posted the article.]

599
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,040
[After I accidentally discovered]

600
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,840
[Xu Mengyu's plagiarism,]

601
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,280
[I thought she was wrong]

602
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,840
[and made]

603
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
[the whole thing public.]

604
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,880
[But I didn't expect]

605
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,240
[things came to this,]

606
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,040
[nor did I expect you to]

607
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,520
[suffer so much because of it.]

608
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,080
[When you were criticized,]

609
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,760
[I hesitated many times]

610
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,080
[whether to step out or not.]

611
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,120
[But in the end, I still didn't have]

612
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,920
[the courage.]

613
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
[But you did it,]

614
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,680
[bravely stepped up and protected me.]

615
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,080
[Thank you.]

616
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,800
[And, Xiao Xiaohua,]

617
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,200
[I'm sorry.]
