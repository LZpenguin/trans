3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,920
Xiaohua, I'm so hungry.

4
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
Why?

5
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
Didn't you just eat this morning?

6
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,520
But I'm still starving.

7
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
What do you want?

8
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
BBQ.

9
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,360
Grilled pork belly,

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,440
spicy beef,

11
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
fatty beef, grilled mushrooms,

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,080
potato slices,

13
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,120
and...

14
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,560
All right, stop.

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll go

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,960
with you.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,040
But...

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,600
I'll get fat.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,400
Then...

20
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640
just forget it.

21
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,400
Ma Yiming!

22
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,560
Why are you

23
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,320
putting my kumquat down?

24
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
It will die if it gets more sun.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Look at Mengyu's flowers.

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
I take such good care of them.

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,600
They need more sunlight.

28
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,000
Aren't you afraid they'll get sunburned?

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
What improper remarks

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,240
you've made!

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,960
I can't stand this anymore.

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,080
What are you gonna do?

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,360
Uh...

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,560
where's Xu Mengyu?

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600
She hasn't been to class for a few days.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
She's accompanying her mom

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
to prepare for a book signing.

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
How do you know

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,440
all this gossip

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,280
that I don't know about?

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,560
Right,

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
I'm a know-it-all!

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
What? Jealous?

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,920
Put my plant back!

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,520
No way!

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,600
Hmph!

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,040
Hello,

48
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,800
Ms. Xiao Yinqian.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,640
I heard

50
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,400
your new novel

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
is set in a school.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,400
Yes,

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
the idea came from my daughter.

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,280
She's in high school now,

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,800
and we talk about

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
a lot together.

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,360
Is your daughter's talent

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,080
in writing

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,520
inherited

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,120
or trained?

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,480
She's not specially trained.

62
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,960
I think her talent is even stronger

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,320
than mine.

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,440
At this signing ceremony,

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,040
I also wanna announce

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,880
that her first

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,640
collection of essays

68
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,640
will be out soon.

69
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,040
Liu Wen.

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Xu Chao.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,440
Jia Letian.

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Mengyu, you're incredible.

73
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
But it's not published yet.

74
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,120
It's my first time

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
publishing a book,

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,440
so I brought some sample copies

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,000
for you guys to review.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
You're so talented.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
Honestly.

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm a big fan

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
of you.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,600
You flatter me.

83
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,000
Amazing!

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Wow.

85
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,920
Xiaohua, this copy is for you.

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,000
I get one too?

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,120
Of course,

88
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,640
every type of reader

89
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,840
is important to me.

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,720
How come

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
anyone can publish a book?

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,560
Well, not everyone.

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,920
You can't.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,640
Who cares?

95
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,240
Ling Dong,

96
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,800
looking forward for your feedback.

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,200
What is this? Let me see.

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,040
Lan Jinghui,

99
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,120
if you want one,

100
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,160
I can get you a copy,

101
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
but this is for Ling Dong.

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,120
No, thanks.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
I don't deserve it.

104
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,920
No worries, Mengyu.

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,040
I'd like one too.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,760
Ma Yiming,

107
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,240
this one is for Ling Dong.

108
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Ma Yiming, take it.

109
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,440
Mengyu,

110
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,040
can I get another one?

111
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,640
Xiaohua, why do you want it?

112
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
To learn and improve.

113
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,400
I didn't print many.

114
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
I didn't expect it to be this popular.

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,600
If you really want,

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
I'll give you my personal copy.

117
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,480
Thanks, I'll read it carefully.

118
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,320
[What do you think?]

119
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,760
[It's really good.]

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,720
[So touching.]

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,080
Everyone,

122
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,880
I have

123
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,760
good news.

124
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,480
This week

125
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,960
is our school's activity week,

126
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,800
so media

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,960
will come to film.

128
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,160
I hope

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
you can stay

130
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,040
after school,

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,320
showcase your talents,

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,520
and help out.

133
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,320
I can.

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,520
What can you do?

135
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,760
Anything.

136
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,560
Fine, you can help

137
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,840
carry equipment.

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,360
Sure.

139
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,280
Xiaohua,

140
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,880
you'll be in charge of decorating

141
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,760
the bulletin board.

142
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,400
Okay.

143
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Liu Shu, Lu Yao, Lin Keke,

144
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,840
do Xiaohua a favour.

145
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:34,880
All right.

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,600
Thank you all.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,240
Over!

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,360
Stand up.

149
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,320
Goodbye, ma'am.

150
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,200
Bye.

151
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,440
I've printed everything.

152
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,800
We can start now.

153
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,960
Why are you so late?

154
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,840
We have a lot

155
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,680
of work to do.

156
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,360
C'mon, we'll die.

157
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Look!

158
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,440
Let's take photos with Mengyu.

159
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,040
Good idea!

160
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,920
But, how about...

161
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,080
Xiaohua, can you start first?

162
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,160
We'll be back

163
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
soon.

164
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,640
Thank you.

165
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,040
Sure.

166
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,920
Help us out.

167
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,400
Thanks a lot.

168
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
You're the best.

169
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:15,920
Let's go.

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,480
Bye.

171
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,240
Mengyu.

172
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,120
Welcome. Here.

173
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,840
Okay.

174
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,640
Well,

175
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,040
you can do it together.

176
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,040
What do you need to put up?

177
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,320
These...

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,760
Let's get to work.

179
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,520
Oh, okay.

180
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,280
Four pretty girls together.

181
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Four of you.

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,960
Perfect.

183
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,280
Hey, boy...

184
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,600
Sorry.

185
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,640
[Let's continue.]

186
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
[It's fine.]

187
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,760
[Good.]

188
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,920
Ma Yiming, let's go play basketball.

189
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm not going, Jinghui.

190
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm taking photos.

191
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,200
What do you have to do here?

192
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,880
I haven't finished the task

193
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,640
assigned to me.

194
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,600
You go ahead.

195
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,760
Can't believe you.

196
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,720
A full-body shot, okay.

197
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,840
You should

198
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
dodge to your left.

199
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,440
Too late now.

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,960
Xiaohua,

201
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,720
are you dumb?

202
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
They're taking pictures,

203
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,360
leaving you doing this alone,

204
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,720
huh?

205
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,400
Enough talk. Just do it.

206
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,480
You handle the tape.

207
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,400
Lucky you

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
ran into us today.

209
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,120
What if you hadn't?

210
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,560
First time realizing

211
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,320
she can't say no?

212
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Today,

213
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm teaching her to say no.

214
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,240
Got it.

215
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,560
Is someone talking?

216
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,560
I didn't hear anything.

217
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,280
I hear nothing.

218
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,520
Got it.

219
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,120
What's that noise?

220
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,680
All right, all right!

221
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,200
I'll say that more often,

222
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,160
like "no", "no way"...

223
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,720
Happy now?

224
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,040
Now that's more like it.

225
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Apprentice,

226
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,800
remember my lessons.

227
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
I'm not your apprentice.

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
Quick learner.

229
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,200
Just tear the tape.

230
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,480
Let's get to work.

231
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,080
Great job, everyone.

232
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,280
I bought you drinks

233
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,400
with my own money.

234
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,160
Enjoy it.

235
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,440
You're so considerate.

236
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
It's the best time.

237
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,440
C'mon.

238
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,000
I want one too.

239
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,000
Qingtian,

240
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,040
come here.

241
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,280
What's up?

242
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,360
I bought you

243
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,880
your favorite milk tea.

244
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,560
Wow! It is!

245
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,680
Thank you.

246
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,240
Enjoy it.

247
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,800
Thanks, you're so sweet.

248
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,840
Excuse me, how about taking a photo?

249
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,520
C'mon, good chance.

250
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,520
Okay, look at me.

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,600
All right,

252
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,800
three,

253
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,160
two...

254
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,720
Wait! Count me in!

255
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,120
Me too!

256
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,720
Come on!

257
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,400
And me.

258
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
Group photo.

259
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,800
Here we go.

260
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,800
3, 2, 1,

261
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,760
cheese!

262
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,360
[All the hourglasses in the world]

[we'd reflect on the fleeting time.]

[Exactly the same.]

[Xu Mengyu plagiarized.]

278
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,920
We need to focus on the view

279
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,120
on the world, life, and values.

280
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
These have appeared on past exams,

281
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,040
though I can't say if they'll be

282
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,720
on this year's.

283
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,720
If they do,

284
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
expect a five-point question.

285
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,280
Memorize this:

286
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
what are worldviews, life views,

287
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,600
and values?

288
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,480
They're

289
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,880
the essence of cultural literacy.

290
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,720
All right,

291
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
let's call it a day.

292
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,960
Over!

293
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,560
Stand up.

294
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Goodbye, ma'am.

295
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,360
Bye.

296
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,800
[I want hotpot.]

297
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,160
[I want something tasty.]

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,640
Hotpot, stir-fried meat, or veggies?

299
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,880
- Hotpot.
- Stir-fried meat.

300
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,520
Hotpot.

301
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,800
Hotpot.

302
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,640
Xiaohua,

303
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,280
what's up?

304
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,400
Nothing.

305
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
Wake up, let's head to school.

306
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,200
It doesn't need much water.

307
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,120
Thanks.

308
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
When you're troubled,

309
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
it's best not to multitask.

310
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Ling Dong,

311
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,920
do you

312
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,640
have any secrets

313
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,360
you want to keep hidden?

314
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,280
I mean,

315
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
I found out something

316
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,400
very personal.

317
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,520
I don't know if I should keep it.

318
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,160
But even if I do,

319
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,520
others will soon find out.

320
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,120
So what do you want to do?

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
I'm thinking of

322
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,120
telling her I know,

323
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,920
but I don't want

324
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,000
to hurt her pride.

325
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,720
Pride can be rebuilt, but losing dignity

326
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,960
is harder to recover from.

327
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,360
Do you want

328
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,840
to protect her pride

329
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,120
but risk her losing dignity

330
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,800
in front of more?

331
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,280
Of course not. I don't want her

332
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,200
to lose her dignity.

333
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,840
Talk to her.

334
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,400
It might help.

335
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,080
Mengyu.

336
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,720
Come with me.

337
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Are you going to tell everyone?

338
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,360
That was not my intention.

339
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,320
Then what are you trying to say?

340
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,320
You're really talented.

341
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,880
You don't need to do this.

342
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,040
Is that all you want to say?

343
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
I hope you can

344
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
withdraw the article

345
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,640
before the book is published,

346
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,680
so the mistake

347
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,840
stops here.

348
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,560
Xiaohua,

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
can you keep it for me?

350
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,600
This essay collection

351
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,840
is very important to me.

352
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,440
But it's not truly yours

353
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
if you do it this way.

354
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,960
I can't let others know,

355
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
especially not my mom.

356
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
Do you understand?

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,160
Even if you don't do this,

358
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,960
you can still publish a book.

359
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,680
Plus,

360
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
your mom is such a famous

361
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,880
and excellent writer.

362
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,520
Precisely because

363
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,880
she's a famous writer,

364
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,280
I've had to be better than others

365
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,240
since I was little.

366
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,200
Stronger abilities, higher expectations.

367
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,360
So I can't let her know

368
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm just ordinary,

369
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,680
that I can't write good articles.

370
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,920
I don't want to disappoint her.

371
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,120
Have you

372
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,280
talked to your mom about this?

373
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,840
It's pointless.

374
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,200
She won't listen.

375
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,520
She thinks her daughter

376
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,920
is always the most talented,

377
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,080
just lacking confidence.

378
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,200
So every day,

379
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,840
she tells me to be confident!

380
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,360
I'm scared

381
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,600
she'll find out one day

382
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,360
that I'm nothing.

383
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,080
My grades are average,

384
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,480
and when I don't do well,

385
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,840
my mom gets really mad,

386
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,640
scolds me a lot.

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,600
But after every scolding,

388
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,520
she makes me

389
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,640
a nice meal.

390
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,320
Because she loves me,

391
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,680
and she knows

392
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,760
I tried my best.

393
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,840
So I think

394
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,680
you should talk

395
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,720
to your mom again.

396
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,600
I believe she'll understand you.

397
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,560
And...

398
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,040
I won't

399
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,920
tell anyone about this.

400
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,280
You serious?

401
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,360
This is our secret.

402
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,560
Mengyu,

403
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,240
I didn't understand the physics problem

404
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,240
the teacher explained.

405
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,920
Did you get it?

406
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,880
Yeah, I got it.

407
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,880
I'll help you after lunch.

408
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,680
Okay.

409
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,880
Mengyu, what are you looking at?

410
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,280
Nothing.

411
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,640
Go save us a seat first.

412
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,280
Keke.

413
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,360
I didn't get this dish.

414
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
Just wanted to try it.

415
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,360
Lan Jinghui, have some of mine.

416
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,760
My apprentice is the best.

417
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,000
But I wanted that meat.

418
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,760
Am I seeing things?

419
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Jinghui, have mine too.

420
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,160
Too late.

421
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Xiaohua,

422
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,320
I got today's special

423
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
just for you.

424
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Mengyu?

425
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,040
Thanks.

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Xiaohua,

427
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
when did you get

428
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,240
so close to her?

429
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,120
You didn't betray us,

430
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,440
did you?

431
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,360
Of course not.

432
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,320
Xiaohua,

433
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,960
you're the first person

434
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,160
Mengyu's been so nice to.

435
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,520
What's your secret?

436
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,880
This is the first time

437
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
I've seen this at school.

438
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,080
They made it especially for her?

439
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,120
Maybe she poisoned it?

440
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,520
Nonsense,

441
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,120
Mengyu isn't like that.

442
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,680
Maybe it's because I helped her

443
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,760
promote her essay collection.

444
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
Sh! Eat up!

445
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,840
It'll get cold.

446
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Something's off with her.

447
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,320
Just eat, guys.

448
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,600
Mengyu.

449
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,120
Mom.

450
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,480
Take a look at this.

451
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,240
Mom,

452
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,080
I have something to tell you.

453
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,040
Later.

454
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,760
Look at this now.

455
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,920
I picked out a few outfits

456
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
for your book launch.

457
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,560
Do you like any of them?

458
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,240
How about this one?

459
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,160
It's okay.

460
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,840
A bit plain, right?

461
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,840
This one?

462
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,160
It's nice.

463
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,800
Right, the details are perfect.

464
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,840
You'll look great in this

465
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,600
at your event.

466
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,960
My daughter is the best.

467
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,200
Mengyu,

468
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,360
what did you

469
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,080
want to tell me?

470
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,360
Nothing, Mom.

471
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,880
Okay, I'll go order the clothes.

472
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,920
Thanks.

473
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,360
Unbelievable.

474
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
[She really did this?]

475
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,800
[Yeah.]

476
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,520
[That's like... blatant plagiarism.]

477
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,560
[It's word-for-word the same.]

478
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,840
[How is this possible?]

479
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,600
[I can't believe it either.]

480
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,960
[Is it true?]

481
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,600
[She just]

482
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,720
[turned it into her book?]

483
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,840
Xu Mengyu...

484
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,480
Mengyu...

485
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,800
Xiaohua,

486
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,520
I can't believe you did this.

487
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,640
I trusted you

488
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
to keep it a secret.

489
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,280
If you were going to expose me,

490
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,320
why pretend

491
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,720
to be nice?

492
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,360
How despicable!

493
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,200
What's going on?

494
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,680
Xiaohua,

495
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,320
what's this all about?

496
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,720
Xiao Xiaohua,

497
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,640
how did you find out

498
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,600
Xu Mengyu plagiarized?

499
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,280
Yeah, you kept it hidden well.

500
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
Any more gossip

501
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,280
to share with us?

502
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,920
Xiao Xiaohua,

503
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,760
[we all misjudged you.]

504
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
[Didn't expect you to be so cunning.]

505
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,560
[Because of you,]

506
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,480
[Mengyu is too embarrassed]

507
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,120
[to come to school!]

508
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,760
[Seriously, Xiao Xiaohua,]

509
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,240
[you went too far.]

510
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,520
[You wanted everyone to know,]

511
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:20,800
[right?]

512
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,360
Watch your words.

513
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,360
Actually,

514
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,080
it's not entirely Xiaohua's fault,

515
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,520
right?

516
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,240
If Xu Mengyu hadn't plagiarized,

517
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,520
none of this would have happened.

518
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,040
This is just justice being served.

519
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,600
This kind of underhanded tactic,

520
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,000
isn't it just personal revenge?

521
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,320
I say,

522
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,040
be more upright.

523
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
I believe in Xiaohua.

524
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,240
This isn't something she would do!

525
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,360
Mengyu said 

526
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,920
Xiao Xiaohua did it!

527
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
If not her, then who?

528
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,280
[Patriotism]

529
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,480
[is the core spirit]

530
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,080
[of the Chinese nation.]

531
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,840
[It's reflected]

532
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,440
[in unity, peace,]

533
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
[hard work, bravery,]

534
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,880
[and self-improvement.]

535
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,640
[They complement each other,]

536
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,000
[all reflecting]

537
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,200
[the theme of patriotism.]

538
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,640
[At any time,]

539
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,160
[patriotism unites]

540
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,520
[and motivates the Chinese people,]

541
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,880
[serving as a spiritual pillar]

542
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,920
[for all ethnic groups]

543
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,840
[to stand strong together.]

544
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,080
[Patriotism is not abstract.]

545
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,240
[It's very real.]

546
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,160
[As the Chinese people...]

547
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,440
[Ma'am,]

548
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,400
[are you sure]

549
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,280
[you don't want to reconsider?]

550
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,120
Thank you, Ms. Fang,

551
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
but I've decided.

552
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,320
I'll come in a few days

553
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,800
to handle Mengyu's transfer.

554
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,280
[All right,]

555
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,480
[best of luck.]

556
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,400
Thank you.

557
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,120
Goodbye.

558
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,720
Transfer?

559
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,200
[I just heard.]

560
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,360
[I don't know.]

561
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,080
Listen!

562
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,280
you've driven her to transfer.

563
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,120
Are you happy?

564
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,200
What?

565
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,120
Transfer?

566
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,000
Xu Mengyu?

567
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,040
Her mom came

568
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,880
to handle the transfer.

569
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,840
I saw it myself!

570
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,120
How did it come to this?

571
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,920
Is she okay?

572
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,360
Why did you do this?

573
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,680
I didn't.

574
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,640
Ma Yiming,

575
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,880
do you know

576
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,880
what you're doing?

577
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,560
This whole thing is 'cause

578
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,480
Xu Mengyu plagiarized.

579
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,240
Do you know that?

580
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,080
Jinghui,

581
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,080
I know exactly what I'm doing.

582
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,680
Do you know what she's doing?

583
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,480
Does she know

584
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,320
what she's doing?

585
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,360
The plagiarism

586
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,480
isn't even confirmed.

587
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,600
Wait,

588
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,440
she said she didn't do it.

589
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,040
Do you believe her?

590
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes, I do.

591
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,800
Mengyu said

592
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,280
only Xiao Xiaohua

593
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,320
knew about this.

594
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,160
But I didn't!

595
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,040
Ma Yiming,

596
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,400
there's no

597
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,400
concrete evidence

598
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,760
that Xiao Xiaohua did it.

599
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,240
So, since there's a dispute,

600
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
we should find evidence.

601
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I think Ling Dong is right.

602
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,280
Why don't we look for evidence

603
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
instead of arguing over here?

604
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,920
Mengyu said it herself.

605
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,360
Jinghui, don't you know?

606
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,280
Xiao Xiaohua said she didn't.

607
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,480
You heard it too.

608
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,360
See?

609
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,680
I think he's right.

610
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,440
You just don't understand Mengyu.

611
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,600
Why do you think...

612
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,800
Did I ask you to speak?

613
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,320
Can you shut up?

614
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,280
Ma Yiming,

615
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,600
you're just

616
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,880
favoring Xu Mengyu,

617
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,600
do you know that?

618
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,360
I'm not.

619
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,040
But you're favoring

620
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,840
Ling Dong!

621
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,760
What does this have to do with him?

622
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,560
Whatever he says

623
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,120
is right,

624
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,360
and whatever I say is wrong!

625
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,360
With

626
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,480
no evidence,

627
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,480
why believe him

628
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,280
but not me?

629
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
I believe whoever

630
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,920
makes sense.

631
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,200
Sense, huh?

632
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,240
Let me tell you,

633
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,400
ever since you started

634
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,440
tutoring with him,

635
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,120
you've been glued together.

636
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,040
Whenever I invited you

637
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,040
to play basketball

638
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
or hang out,

639
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,800
you just

640
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,840
refused!

641
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,040
What's your excuse?

642
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
Is that your sense?

643
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,560
So

644
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,200
now studying with him

645
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,080
is wrong?

646
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,680
Yes, it is!

647
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,240
Keep studying with him.

648
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,800
Don't come to me.

649
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,440
Ma Yiming!

650
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,120
Leave me alone!

651
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,560
What are you drawing?

652
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,360
It's ugly.

653
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
King of the beasts.

654
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,960
King of the table.

655
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,080
What do you see here?

656
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,560
C'mon, look!

657
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Why are you ignoring me?

658
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,320
Is it not good enough?

659
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,920
Lan Jinghui.

660
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,480
Or because...

661
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,520
Recognize it?

662
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,080
[Can you reach it?]

663
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,720
[Give it to me!]

664
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,080
[Just a bit short!]

665
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,520
Lan Jinghui.

666
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,600
What now?

667
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,040
Does it look alike?

668
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes.

669
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,320
Really?

670
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,680
Well? Does it now?

671
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,720
What are you doing?

672
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,520
Finally got a photo with Ling Dong.

673
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,040
Too bad,

674
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,520
can't see his face clearly.

675
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,080
Next time...

676
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
I must get

677
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,920
a clear one.
