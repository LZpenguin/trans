00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,320
Wait a minute!

4
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
What is this?

5
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,640
A friendship letter!

6
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,280
Why are you so surprised?

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,720
Isn't it natural for me

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
to receive such a letter?

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
In my previous school,

10
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,160
such letters I received

11
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,640
could fill a burlap bag.

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,760
See?

13
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,760
Just in two days.

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,800
Read it for me.

10015
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,240
-You know that.
-I know, Jinghui.

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,040
[Show me.]

17
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,920

[Naive.]

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,040
Qingtian,

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,880
how could it be with Lan Jinghui?

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,920
I placed it on

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,280
Ling Dong's desk.

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,640
The letter

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,840
must not be seen by Jinghui.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
Or there is nothing

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,920
I can do to explain.

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Xiao Xiaohua,

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,320
I know your secret,

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,760
and I'll make it public.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,680
What should I do, Qingtian?

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,480
It's okay, Xiaohua,

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,840
take a candy and calm down.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
Yes, we must find a way

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,320
to retrieve the letter.

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,640
I would rather my admiration

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,800
for Ling Dong be buried forever,

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,760
which is better than being threatened.

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Well,

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,440
what should we do?

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
Listen, here's my plan.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,160
Just one look, Jinghui.

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
Just a glance.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,520
Um,

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,120
come with me, come on.

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,680
Why?

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,680
You'll know.

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm going, too.

48
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Save it.

49
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Why are you in such a hurry?

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
You'll know.

51
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,920
Ma Yiming,

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,360
could you please help me

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,480
buy a bottle of milk?

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,400
I can't.

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,080
Why?

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,480
You're not as beautiful as Xu Mengyu.

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,880
Buy it for me!

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,520
Hey, hold on.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Why are you in such a hurry?

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Didn't you promise me to

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,120
teach me how to ride a bicycle?

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,920
Right now?

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,640
How can I teach you

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,760
without a bicycle now? After school.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,400
Wait, I mean,

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
you can teach me the action of riding.

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,880
That's right.

68
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,160
Come with me.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,200
The key is to

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,680
make flexible leg movements.

71
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,040
It's important to use waist and belly.

72
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,440
Upper limb strength cannot be ignored.

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,720
Cannot!

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,000
Of course,

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,240
the most important thing

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,840
of riding a bicycle

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,520
is balance.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,280
Alright.

79
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,920
I don't think I can make it.

80
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,560
Maybe next time.

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,680
Hold on,

82
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,640
balance is very important.

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Let me switch to a simpler method.

84
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
I have a

85
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,560
more basic way

86
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
to get started.

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,440
He took it away.

88
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,960
What, how do you know?

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,600
Ling Dong, can you...

90
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:34,920
No.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,360
Why?

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
It has nothing to do with me.

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
It has everything to do with you!

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,040
What is the probability that

95
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,880
[I roll a dice with a number]

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,320
[less than three?]

97

[Guys, please tell me,]

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,080
[what is the number]

99

[less than three]

100
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,720
[in numbers one to six?]

101
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:56,960
[Chen Luyang, please.]

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,800
[One and two.]

103
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,880
[Correct.]

104
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,840
[So what is the probability]

105
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,320
[of the number 1 appearing?]

106
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
[It's one-sixth.]

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,320
[Similarly,]

108
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
[the probability of 2 is one-sixth.]

109
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,440
[Analogously,]

110
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
[the probability of 3 or 5 occurring]

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
is also one-sixth.

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,520
So tell me,

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,120
what is one-sixth plus one-sixth

114
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,440
plus one-sixth

115
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,400
equal to?

116
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,440
Here comes the teacher.

117
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,160
It's a half.

118
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,920

are you playing with your phone?

120
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,000
No.

121
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,360
If you don't mind.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,520
I admit.

123
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,160
I did.

124
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,760
Take it out.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,520
Good for you.

126
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:57,880
Hurry up.

127
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,880
Nice.

128
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:10,920
[OK.]

129
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,960
[Let's talk about the next question.]

130
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,760
[Odd numbers.]

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,600
[As we just mentioned,]

132

[this includes]

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,040
[one, three, and five.]

134
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,640
[Similarly, the probability,]

135
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,440
[one-sixth plus one-sixth]

136
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,240
[plus one-sixth,]

137
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,320
[is a half.]

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,400
[Alright, boys and girls,]

139
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,640
[we've summarized the probability formula]

140

[for classical probability model.]

141
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,480
[The probability value of A]

142
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,000
[is obtained by dividing the number of]

143

[basic events contained in A]

144
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,720
[by the sum of the basic events.]

145
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,200
[For example.]

146

Teacher?

147
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,000
What's up?

148
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,960
Ma Yiming is playing with his phone.

149
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,880

Hurry up.

151
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Don't disturb others in class.

152

He was just playing,

153
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,120
right in the hole of the table.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,440
Ma Yiming,

155
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,160
don't waste the time

You are true friends.

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,000
OK.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
[I hope you can remember]

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,680
[the knowledge]

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,480
[I just taught.]

162
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,400
[That's all]

163
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,440
[for our lesson today.]

164
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,480
[I have written the homework]

OK, you're dismissed.

167
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
Please hold on!

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,640
What about my phone?

10169
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,680
Your phone?

170
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,200
Well,

171
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,760
come to me for it

172
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,480
during your vacation this semester.

173
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,880
Or tell your parents

174
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,400
to pick it up tomorrow.

175
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,400
Class is over.

176
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,720
Stand up.

177
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,200
Goodbye, teacher.

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,120
Goodbye.

179
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,040
When did I play with my phone?

180
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
If you don't,

181
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,920
you must have been sleeping!

182
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
I slept in class,

183
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
but I didn't play with my phone.

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,720
As your desk mate,

185
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,840
I have an obligation to supervise you.

186
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,160
Your obligation to supervise me?

187
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,720
Was I sleeping just now?

188
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
I didn't play with my phone,

189
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
why did you tell the teacher

190
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,080
I was playing with my phone?

191
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
Now I lost my phone!

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Okay, come out.

193
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,200
Come out.

194
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,960
I have to say that

195
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,800
you're increasingly unreasonable

196
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,640
as you get older.

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,360
You're getting older!

198
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,240
And you're unreasonable!

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,960
What are you doing?

200
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,480
It will distract your attention.

201
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I have an obligation to supervise you.

202
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,000
Receiving so many letters every day,

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
how dare you say that to me?

204
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,680
Alright.

205
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,680
How about this?

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
Let's hand them over together.

207
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
No.

208
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,280
Are you insane?

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,960
How about

210
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
we make another bet?

211
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
We race for 800 meters.

212
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,240
I will return the letters to you

213
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,440
if you win.

214
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:57,960
Bro,

215
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,760
you bet my letter

216
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,560
on me,

217
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
is it even fair?

218
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,640
If you win,

219
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,440
not only will I return the letters,

220
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,960
but I promise you not to mention that

221
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
you are my nephew

222
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
ever since.

223
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
Deal.

224
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,560
But as a bet,

225
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,600
this letter cannot

226
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,960
stay in your hands.

227
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,480
Come on.

228
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,240
Where do you want to put it?

229
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,080
Let me see,

230
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,800
I'll put it here.

231
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,960
No way.

232
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,560
I disagree.

233
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,320
This is a complaint box,

234
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,400
and it belongs to the public.

235
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,800
You dare not bet with me?

236
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,600
How is that possible?

237
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,400
Put it in.

238
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,240
Put it in now.

239
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,360
Don't cry later,

240
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,720
don't shed tears.

241
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,400
Hurry up.

242
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,560
After you.

243
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,120
I'll go to the restroom.

244
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,240
Why?

245
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Are you afraid

246
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,400
of me now?

247
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,360
[I'll count to ten.]

248
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
How's it going, Xiaohua?

249
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,960
I can't open it without a key.

250
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,440
I can't put my hands in.

251
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,120
How about you

252
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,040
give it a try?

253
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Let's turn it upside down.

254
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,480
Shall we?

255
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,480
It's okay.

256
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
What are you doing?

257
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,160
Ma Yiming, why are you here?

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
You are destroying public property.

259
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,360
Don't talk nonsense!

260
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
Ma Yiming, I don't have time

261
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,120
to fool around with you.

262
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,600
I'll report your behavior.

263
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
How dare you?

264
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,600
It's here.

265
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,720
Chen Luyang!

266
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,760
The box for voting

267
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,240
of Student Union is broken,

268
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,800
I need to borrow this one.

269
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,400
Qingtian, trust me.

270
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
I will win.

271
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,400
Are you teasing me, Ling Dong?

272
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,760
Ling Dong!

273
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,960
How dare you?

274
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Jinghui!

275
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,880
How dare you tease me?

276
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,600
The complaint box is gone.

277
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,960
Don't talk nonsense to me.

278
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,160
An 800-meter race,

279
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,400
now!

280
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,440
It's really gone.

281
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,160
What do you mean?

282
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,680
Our complaint box has been

283
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,880
borrowed by the Student Union.

284
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,920
The Student Union voting

285
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,440
is about to begin now.

286
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,480
What about my letter?

287
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
It's still inside.

288
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,760
[Attention please,]

The voting has ended.

297
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,440
Let's invite Mr. Zhang to

298
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,560
count the votes for us.

299

Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

My pleasure.

Yes.

Eight rounds.

Only six.

Being a class rep,

why are you so poor in math?

338
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,800
I count one by one.

339
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Keep an eye on it.

340

Nope, I must keep watch on him.

What a task!

347
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,480

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,800
You've drunk my milk!

354
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,480
I thought you gave me this

355
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,200
because of our friendship.

356
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,400
If you meant more,

357
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,960
I can return it.

358
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,520
I've done 10 laps.

359
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,720
You've completed 6 laps.

360
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,960
Now you are on the 7th lap.

361
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,280
And there're 3 laps left.

362
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,960
I am now doubting

363
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,760
the authenticity of your math grades.

364
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,560
You are slandering me.

365
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,640
Class rep,

366
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,640
while you were drinking milk,

367
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,120
Jinghui had already finished

368
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,280
in a flash.

369
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,960
You see?

370
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,160
Don't waste time with him.

371
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Let's go.

372
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,280
Lan Jinghui,

373
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,800
you are now in a terrible situation.

374
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,960
Mr. Zhang has tasked me

375
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,240
with supervising you.

376
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,720
What if you slack off

377
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
and get caught?

378
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,800
Lan Jinghui.

379
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,360
Jesus.

380
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,920
Hi, Mr. Zhang.

381
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,680
Lan Jinghui,

382
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
you stop right there!

383
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,720
Unbelievable.

384
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,760
Mysterious.

385
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,480
The envelope with

386
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,200
the baby's-breath was mine,

387
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,040
but the letter wasn't the one I wrote.

388
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,240
It's like finding

389
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,800
a spicy seasoning packet

390
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,480
inside a bag of

391
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
savory crisps.

392
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,960
Exactly.

393
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,600
Um,

394
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,520
where is the letter then?

395
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,960
It couldn't have just disappeared.

396
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,000
Class rep,

397
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,520
class rep.

398
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,640
Dong, can I help you?

399
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:56,960
Oh,

400
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,760
I should call you President Chen

401
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
instead of class rep.

402
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,560
No, no, no.

403
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,120
We're just classmates.

404
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,400
Don't be so formal.

405
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,280
Besides,

406
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,840
the voting results aren't revealed yet.

407
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,760
Just call me class rep.

408
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,920
Mr. Zhang just asked

409
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,480
you to go to his office,

410
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,640
seemingly about

411
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,280
the student council election.

412
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,840
Do you think he already

413
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,120
has the results

414
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,000
and wants to

415
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,040
inform you in advance?

416
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,320
Really?

417
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,080
The ballot box...

418
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,680
Well, I can take it.

419
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
OK, take it to the gym.

420
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,280
I'll go there later.

421
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,280
Got it, President Chen.

422
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
[Dear Ling Dong,]

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,840
[writing this letter]

424
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,520
[has taken all the courage I've gathered]

425
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,400
[over my last seventeen years.]

426
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,200
[You might find it exaggerated]

427
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,960
[because you are so outstanding]

428
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,880
[and always at the forefront]

429
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,840
[of the crowd.]

430
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,880
[You probably can't imagine]

431
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,080
[how a plain, insignificant girl]

432
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
[like me]

433
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,120
[has strived to stand on tiptoe,]

434
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,880
[looking up to you.]

435
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,360
[To me, you're like]

436
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,200
[the rose in "The Little Prince."]

437
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
[I kept my secrets]

438
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,840
[hidden in my heart,]

439
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
[which has turned into]

440
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,400
[a starry sky.]

441
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,240
[You are the brightest star]

442
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,320
[in this sky.]

443
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,240
[I strive to get closer to you,]

444
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,920
[to become someone who shines]

445
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,600
[and can illuminate others.]

446
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,360
[From an unnoticed girl]

447
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,040
[who admires you silently,]

448
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,320
[Xiao Xiaohua.]

449
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,360
Jinghui,

450
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
this letter is written to criticize you.

451
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,440
Why do you piece them together?

452
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,040
Only when they're pieced together

453
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
could I know who's criticizing me.

454
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,640
and trying to set me up.

455
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,840
Jinghui, you just transferred to this school.

456
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,880
Who would frame you up?

457
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,320
That's the point.

458
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,200
I just got transferred,

459
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,120
who's setting me up?

460
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,360
Who's scheming against me?

461
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,480
Why would they?

462
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,360
What's the reason behind it all?

463
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,320
Who is trying to frame me?

464
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,280
I have an idea.

465
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,200
What are these?

466
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,320
This one.

467
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,240
Not him.

468
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,600
What are you doing?

469
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,440
I've told you

470
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,120
don't touch my belongings.

471
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,800
I wanna make sure

472
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,120
whether you wrote the letter.

473
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,360
And?

474
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,240
It's not you who wrote the letter.

475
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,240
But if I hadn't

476
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,840
made a bet with you,

477
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,640
would Mr. Zhang have noticed it?

478
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,080
Because you're foolish.

479
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,800
Ling Dong, what do you mean?

480
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,480
Jinghui,

481
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
calm down.

482
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,280
The key is to find out

483
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,160
who's write that letter

484
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
to frame you.

485
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
The truth is about to come to light.

486
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,640
Let's search one by one.

487
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,760
None of them.

488
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,120
Who else?

489
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,360
We've searched all.

490
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,520
Why do you look at me?

491
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,160
Except you.

492
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,640
Did you write the letter?

493
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,960
You deserve a beat.

494
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
Well, look at the paper.

495
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
It's the same as yours.

496
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,120
Do I look like a lunatic?

497
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,240
Try to harm myself?

498
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,720
You got a point.

499
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,440
If the person is not our classmate,

500
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,520
it would be hard to find out.

501
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,880
Who did that?

502
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,160
I lost it.

503
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,480
What?

504
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,960
Who rummaged my books?

505
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,520
My books were rummaged as well.

506
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Who did that?

507
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
What a bad behavior!

508
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
Ma Yiming and Lan Jinghui.

509
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
I saw them did that.

510
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,760
Where are they?

511
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
Lan Jinghui!

512
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,200
Sorry, everyone.

513
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Due to

514
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,680
my personal issues and reasons,

515
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,280
it has affected

516
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,400
the image of our class.

517
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
I apologize to everyone.

518
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Sorry.

519
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,400
Sorry.

520
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,400
Let's share some drinks.

521
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,320
Lan Jinghui,

522
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,360
how can you

523
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,440
rummage our items?

524
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,480
That's why I apologize.

525
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,320
That rumor about Lan isn't true, right?

526
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,440
Yeah, how could that be possible?

527
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,520
One person fighting fifty people.

528
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
We don't know for sure.

529
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,040
What if it's true?

530
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,200
You've been bought off by the drinks.

531
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,880
Alright.

532
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,360
Did you drink it or not?

533
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
You know in your heart.

534
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,640
Not gossiping about him if you drank it.

535
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,040
Fine.

536
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,880
I said it was impossible.

537
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,880
Don't believe or spread rumors.

538
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,200
I've seen plenty of students like him.

539
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,960
He must have been expelled

540
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,720
from his previous school,

541
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,360
so he was transferred.

542
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,680
Don't you know that?

543
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,880
He's transferred through many schools,

544
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,760
always getting into fights

545
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,640
and trouble.

546
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,080
With someone like him in our class,

547
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,960
the entire class's reputation

548
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
will be dragged down.

549
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,520
I agree.

550
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,040
I've refused this drink.

551
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,000
But he insisted.

552
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,520
It tastes terrible.

553
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,400
What happened?

554
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,280
Who put this

555
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,400
under my books?

556
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,400
Put what?

557
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
This one?

558
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,000
It's fake.

559
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,680
Take it away!

560
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,120
You seem timider than girls.

561
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,280
I'm sorry.

562
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,440
It's mine.

563
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,680
I walked my pet this morning.

564
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,840
It ran away.

565
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,800
I don't know what happened.

566
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,320
I don't know how...

567
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,920
Take it away!

568
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,440
Help!

569
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,840
It's fake.

570
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,720
The water tastes salty.

571
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Salty water?

572
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
It can't be as sweet as my drinks.

573
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,200
Lan Jinghui, are these your doings?

574
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,400
Well,

575
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,840
Too many sweets make your throat sore.

576
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,720
I added a bit of salt for you.

577
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,400
The salt will balance the sweetness.

578
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,160
It's good for your health.

579
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,040
You...

580
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,720
Your body

581
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,840
needs salt, doesn't it?

582
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Isn't this good?

583
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,960
Or I can get you some water.

584
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,640
Come in.

585
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,120
Ms. Fang, what do you need from me?

586
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,520
What are these?

587
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,440
Complaints from your classmates.

588
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,280
All against you.

589
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,240
Ms. Fang, you said

590
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,360
you wouldn't check the complaint box.

591
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,480
If I want to,

592
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,320
I will.

593
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,400
I unexpectedly found that

594
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the students are

595
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,920
unprecedentedly united because of you.

596
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,240
They're just being petty.

597
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,240
Conflicts among

598
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,880
classmates are normal, right?

599
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,840
Tattling to the teacher is so childish.

600
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,480
You need more self-reflections, right?

601
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,680
No, I've written enough.

602
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,680
That means

603
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,440
the previous one wasn't sincere enough.

604
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,480
This time,

605
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,160
write a 3,000-word reflection.

606
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,040
Write it thoroughly

607
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,000
and seriously,

608
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,680
including the causes,

609
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,800
the results

610
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,840
and the correction measures.

611
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Show me your sincerity.

612
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,200
Can you do that?

613
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,680
Ms. Fang,

614
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,920
is there any room for negotiation?

615
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,600
Nope.

616
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,920
Jinghui,

617
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,280
It hard to catch my breath with this.

618
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,280
Let's put it off.

619
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,000
OK, it's not necessary.

620
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,520
Let's deal with them one by one.

621
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,680
So many to deal with, right?

622
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Can you recognize the bikes of them?

623
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,640
Of course, they are my classmates

624
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,680
for many years.

625
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,520
Good.

626
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,000
Chen Luyang first.

627
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,360
And Liu Shu.

628
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,360
She's a girl.

629
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,200
Let her go.

630
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,640
OK?

631
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,080
Li Ruosi.

632
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:11,760
Here

633
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,560
And?

634
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,080
Ling Dong.

635
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:15,960
Who?

636
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,440
Ling Dong.

637
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
Ling Dong didn't write any complaints.

638
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,240
He instigated them.

639
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,800
Jinghui,

640
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,920
You have a prejudice against him.

641
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,480
He has a "pride" against me.

642
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Hurry up!

643
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,240
Are you sure?

644
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm sure.

645
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,680
OK, here we go.

646
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
The semester has started,

647
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,880
why don't you introduce me

648
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,920
to the basketball team of this school?

649
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,960
Training hasn't started yet.

650
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,040
Don't worry.

651
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,880
Our team's skill level

652
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,160
is top-notch.

653
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,520
Don't brag.

654
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,400
I transferred here

655
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,000
specifically to play basketball.

656
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,360
What about

657
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:09,760
Ling Dong?

658
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,400
He's really something.

659
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,080
Um, he's a typical

660
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,960
"triple high": high scores,

661
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,680
highly aloof, and high intelligence.

662
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,200
He's the superstar at school,

663
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,720
consistently a top student,

664
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,040
and wins awards left and right.

665
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,280
He's way ahead of you.

666
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,440
Then which side are you on?

667
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,440
You praise him!

668
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,360
I came to this school

669
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,280
for you.

670
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,920
You just said

671
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,760
you transferred to this school

672
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,600
to play basketball.

673
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,960
To understand the situation in detail,

674
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
I must know my opponent well,

675
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,040
then I can defeat him easily.

676
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,440
Jinghui,

677
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,800
It's your first day at this school.

678
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,080
He's your desk mate.

679
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,240
If it's not something major between you,

680
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,280
just let it go.

681
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,880
If he doesn't bother me, I won't bother him.

682
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,120
But if he does,

683
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,560
I'll be a nuisance for sure.

684
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,320
Then you try to bother him,

685
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
not me.
