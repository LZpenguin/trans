00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,080
Who said I can't play?

178
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,000
Why are you yelling

179
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,400
at me?

180
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,960
Referee,

181
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
isn't this a technical foul?

182
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,360
Get this old man out of here!

183
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,480
Who are you calling old man?

184
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,600
Let's talk about it later.

185
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
Let's talk later.

186
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
Come on, come on.

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What was that?

188
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,560
Don't you think what you said

189
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,280
went a bit too far?

190
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,480
Why are you laughing?

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,320
You don't understand, you don't have kids.

192
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,240
His grandfather used to do the same to me.

193
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,600
Saw his stiffness just now?

194
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
It's a psychological tactic, you know?

195
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,320
Jinghui,

196
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,840
I know finals are nerve-wracking.

197
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
It's okay, keep going, you can do it.

198
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,520
Keep it up, Jinghui.

199

[These are small mistakes.]

[Everyone makes mistakes.]

It's okay. Stay strong,

keep pushing.

203

You got it.

You got this, Jinghui.

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,440
why are you comforting me?

207

I'm Ash Lan,

Captain of Chenjun school.

209

I don't need concern

210

from you ordinary people.

211
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,240
You can do it.

Come on.

Okay, game continues.

- Good shot!
- Nice!

Nice one!

See? He's back in the game.

223

Class 8 requests a substitution.

240
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,560
Substitution.

Guys,

the first quarter

252
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,440
went pretty well.

253

Let's stick

254
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,160
to the strategy.

255

Chao, Qiangzi, Yiming,

256
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,680
you played great.

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,400
Got it.

You played well today. Good job.

I can't stand anymore, Mr. Zhang,

Ling Dong shoots as soon as he gets it?

275
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,280
With so many people, can he make it?

276
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,720
Because of the trust between teammates,

277
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,360
he can shoot decisively

278
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,080

their defense

287
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,960

Great work.

Keep this up and we'll win.

309
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,320
Not bad.

310
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,800
I told Ms. Chai

311
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,680
you'd take

312
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,720
first place.

313
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,280
We must get first place,

314
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,760

315
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,360
Keep it up!

316
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,240
- Absolutely!
- Yeah!

317
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,880
We lost our rhythm

318
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,240
in the first half.

319
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
Don't let Class 5 control the pace.

320
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,080
Stay calm

321
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,360
and play to our strengths.

322
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,840
In the second half, Bi Peng,

324
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960

stick to the plan.

329
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,360
I don't see any problem.

330
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,280
If they keep

331
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,800
playing like this,

332
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,760
use your strength, okay?

333
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,520
- Okay!
- Got it.

334

Toughen up on defense.

338
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,240
Both inside and outside, play tough,

339
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,600
okay?

340
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay.

341

Who's that mascot?

342
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,160
No idea,

343
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,920
but the dancing is good.

344
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,680
Pretty cute.

Come on!

352
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,440
Go, go!

353
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,000
Huddle up!

354
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,520
Come on,

355
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,120
last few words:

356
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,520
play hard, we'll win this,

357
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,120
our last high school basketball game.

358
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Give it all!

359
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,280
- Give it all!
- Give it all!

360
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,920
Class 5, Class 5, victory!

361
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,600
Go!

362
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,600
Go!

363
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,560
Isn't that a foul?

364
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Ms. Fang.

365
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,200
Are you okay?

366
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,200
Hang in there.

367
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,000
Go!

368
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Nice!

369
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,520
[Class 5 is in trouble.]

370
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
[In the first half,]

371
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,920
[they used tactics]

372
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,280
[to surprise the opponent,]

373
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,960
[but now they're running out of stamina.]

374
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,320
[Their biggest enemy]

375
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,040
[is fatigue.]

376
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,600
Scored, let's go.

377
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,560
You okay?

378
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,800
Ling Dong! Ling Dong!

379
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,160
What's wrong?

380
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,360
Are you okay?

381
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,880
Talk to me.

382
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Are you uncomfortable or in pain?

383
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,440
Referee, we need a substitution.

384
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Jia Letian, you're on.

385
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,160
Okay.

386
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,240
Just tired?

387
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,280
Yeah, tired.

388
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,280
Let's help him up.

389
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,600
Are you okay?

390
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Let's get you up.

391
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,360
Nod if you're okay.

392
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,720
Here,

393
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,720
one, two, three.

394
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,640
Make room.

395
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,560
Here, water.

396
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,760
Lan Jinghui, go play.

397
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,280
Jia Letian, you're in.

398
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,120
Okay.

399
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,320
Pass it to me, pass it to me.

400
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,320
- Defense!
- Attack!

401
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,160
They're already shaken.

402
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,800
If they

403
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,560
keep losing points,

404
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,440
the game is in danger.

405
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,000
Lan Jinghui is the key

406
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,760
to this game.

407
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,280
What's going on?

408
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,120
Jinghui.

409
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,800
Class 5!

410
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,880
Must win!

411
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,120
Must win!

412
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,520
Must win!

413
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,440
Go! Go! Go!

414
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,280
Must win!

415
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,640
Attack! Attack!

416
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,280
Defense! Class 8, defense!

417
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,160
Go!

418
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,560
Nice!

419
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,080
Awesome!

420
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,840
Great shot!

421
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Go! Go! Go!

422
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,720
Go! Go! Go!

423
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,000
Attack! Attack!

424
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
Single-sided breakthrough,

425
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
three steps, score.

426
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,520
Watch your distance from the hoop

427
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,800
during your layup.

428
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,760
5, 6, 7, 8.

429
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,800
1, 2, 3, 4.

430
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,280
5, 6, 7, 8.

431
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,400
2, 2, 3, 4.

432
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,200
5, 6, 7, 8.

433
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,880
Your moves were correct,

434
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,680
but it just feels weird.

435
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,920
Right?

436
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,720
I also feel

437
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,520
something's off.

438
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,200
I have an idea.

439
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,120
What?

440
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Will this really work?

441
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,760
Of course.

442
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
If played well, it's a secret weapon.
