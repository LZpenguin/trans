what do you want from me.

Okay. Wait and see.

Don't push me

14
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,760
to my last resort.

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,240
I don't have a weak spot.

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
Except for my susceptibility to handsome guys.

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,480
So that's why you sold me out?

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,680
No other way out,

19
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,480
so I had to do this.

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,560
It won't work, I won't give in,

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
no matter how cute he is.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Got any other ideas?

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,640
Don't you wanna join us

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,360
for stargazing?

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,840
Spill the beans,

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
and you're in.

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,320
Really?

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,400
No lying?

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
Nah,

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
we don't do that.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,720
You just lied to me.

32
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,840
What? We'd

33
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,600
never lie...

34
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,320
Trust me.

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,120
I wouldn't lie to you.

36
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,960
The handsome guy doesn't lie.

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,760
It's auntie.

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,760
She asked me to take your passport.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,720
Your auntie?

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,640
Passport?

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,200
So that's my mom.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,200
Here's the thing.

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Auntie

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
was gonna come back with me,

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
but on the way,

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,320
she got

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
a call and bailed.

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,280
She whispered to me to

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,440
grab your passport,

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
get you a visa,

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
and keep it on the DL.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
But I already have

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,880
a Singapore visa.

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,840
Your visa's from way back

55
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,320
when auntie took you outta here,

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
like a decade ago.

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,440
She thinks

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,280
it's probably

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
outta date by now.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,880
Why didn't you

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
just ask me for it?

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,440
All the

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
sneakiness, huh?

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,560
She probably wanted to

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,360
take you on

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,240
a surprise trip abroad.

67
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Mystery solved.

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Why

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
didn't you tell me earlier?

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,360
If you had shared

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,920
the secret with me sooner,

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
I could've just given it to you.

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,160
Why keep it

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
bottled up?

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,480
So, my mom's got

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,520
a surprise for me.

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,000
Should I play

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,720
dumb?

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,880
Right.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,480
Pretend you don't know.

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,120

Auntie's happy.

83
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
And I'm

84
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,440
off the hook as a spy.

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,080
We're gonna go

86
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,280
stargazing later, right?

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
I gotta get ready for that.

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,640
When's mom

89
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,640
gonna drop the bomb on me?

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,320
How long since you saw her last time?

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
A few years, I think.

92
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,480
And do you think I should

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,640
get her a gift too?

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,480
You said you two

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
went overseas.

96
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,280
And?

97
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,720
And

98
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,120
we lived together,

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,840
and then she remarried

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,920
and brought little Will

101
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,800
into the world.

102
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,080
William.

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,400
William.

104
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
My half-brother.

105
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,520
At that time,

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,560
mom had to juggle

107
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,200
taking care of me

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
and little Will,

109
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,600
and her work.

110
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,040
It was

111
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,280
a lot

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
for her.

113
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,080
I felt bad,

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,640
so I

115
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,040
offered to come back here

116
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,840
to help ease her burden.

117
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,200
I didn't know

118
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,400
you're

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,880
actually pretty thoughtful.

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,720
Of course.

121
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,720
But a bit impulsive.

122
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,760
Back home,

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
I missed her a lot

124
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,600
but I had to hold back

125
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,760
from calling her.

126
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,960
I knew

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,040
she was

128
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,200
swamped with

129
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,680
Will and work,

130
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,640
and didn't

131
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
have the time for me.

132
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,400
But

133
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,280
she's got the surprise

134
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
for me this time,

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,160
so she must be

136
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,560
doing well over there.

137
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,480
Right?

138
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,280
It's nice.

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,920
Here.

180
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,560
No.

181
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,800
I've got more

182
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,560
for you.

183
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
This.

184
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,960
More of that wafer.

185
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,760
Your favorite dried yellow peaches.

186
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,560
And there's more.

187
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,800
Let's take a break.

188
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,520
Yeah, need a break.

189
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,040
Go.

190
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,920
You're getting pretty pro.

191
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
Not bad.

192
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,600
Another

193
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,600
text from the cutie?

194
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
For a lakeside hangout.

195
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,320
She wanna talk about

196
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,880
her new writing piece.

197
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,400
Her writing's

198
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,720
childish and mawkish,

199
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
but I gotta praise her

200
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,480
for her mom's sake.

201
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,440
What?

202
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Dude, you promised

203
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,200
to win her over,

204
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
and now you're already

205
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,160
acting like you've got her on a leash?

206
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,880
Yeah.

207
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm serious,

208
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm over her.

209
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,400
[It's her who's now clingy.]

210
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
[Really?]

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
[Full of hot air.]

212
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,040
[Yeah.]

213
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,480
[It's not.]

214
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,960
[Alright, let's make a bet.]

215
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,200
Let's see

216
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,400
whether she'll wait for me

217
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,200
at the lake for 3 hours or not.

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,760
[Okay.]

219
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
Let's bet on a pair of sneakers.

220
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,800
Yeah.

221
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah, I'll text her now.

222
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,080
Do it.

223
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,680
For real?

224
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Really?

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,920
[Impressive.]

226
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
[The lakeside.]

227
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,560
[I'm gonna send it.]

228
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,640
[Watch this.]

229
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,240
[Alright.]

230
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,640
[Back to the game.]

231
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,200
[Yeah.]

232
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,280
[I got it.]

233
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,000
Block! Block!

234
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,280
Rebound! Good shot!

235
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Pass, pass, pass!

236
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,720
Again, again, again!

237
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Qingtian.

238
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,960
So it's the fun park you wanna go.

239
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
This is great.

240
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,160
It stays the same

241
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,960
no matter how time

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,920
passes.

243
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,280
Yeah.

244
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,000
A dream factory

245
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,200
for all ages.

246
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,240
Two fluffy cotton candies.

247
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
Qingtian, here.

248
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,160
Chow down and ride up.

249
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,360
What's your pick for fun?

250
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,840
Wanna spin on the carousel?

251
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
Alright, let's go.

252
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,320
So, Saturn and Jupiter

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,960
meeting up?

254
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,960
Is it worth

255
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,240
the long trip?

256
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,480
That rare?

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,760
This is their closest

258
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
meet-up in ages.

259
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,200
In astrology,

260
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,200
[they have totally]

261
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,680
[different vibes.]

262
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,480
Jupiter's all about seriousness,

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
calmness, and detachment,

264
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,880
while Saturn brings the luck,

265
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
optimism, and enthusiasm.

266
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,440
Opposite planets

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,040
[hugging?]

268
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,840
This rare

269
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,760
astronomical event

270
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,120
is a must-see.

271
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,040
Sit.

272
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,440
Here.

273
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,560
Curious why I'm

274
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,880
obsessed with

275
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,120
the carousel?

276
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Yeah.

277
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,160
But I'm hesitant to ask,

278
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,760
in case you don't wanna share.

279
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,680
But no matter what,

280
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,280
if it makes you happy,

281
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,600
I'll be there for you.

282
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,560
Don't be sad.

283
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,280
You still wanna

284
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,240
ride the carousel?

285
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
I'll go get the tickets.

286
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,240
Be right back.

287
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,520
No.

288
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
I don't wanna ride it anymore.

289
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,640
When I was a kid,

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,200
I loved riding the carousel.

291
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,680
My parents and I rode it

292
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,800
every visit

293
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,200
to this park.

294
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
So it's

295
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
because of your parents.

296
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,920
No one will ever

297
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,800
ride the carousel with me again.

298
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,400
They're working hard

299
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
to earn money,

300
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,000
so they can buy you more

301
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
delicious snacks, right?

302
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,400
I overheard them arguing.

303
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,920
My parents argue a lot too,

304
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,400
it's pretty normal.

305
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,760
They've divorced,

306
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,480
but they kept it from me

307
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,200
because of Gaokao exam.

308
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,760
Hey, where's my

309
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,280
happy-go-lucky Qingtian?

310
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,080
I'm just down in the dumps.

311
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,960
I bet that optimistic Qingtian

312
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,920
would think that

313
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,000
"even if they aren't together"

314
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
"I gotta look at the bright side."

315
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,520
"Like,"

316
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,520
"double the allowance,"

317
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,760
"double the red envelopes"

318
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,080
"during the holidays,"

319
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,400
"I can buy so much"

320
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,840
"treats."

321
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,840
Hey, stop it.

322
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,360
Qingtian.

323
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,400
They kept it from you

324
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,760
because they

325
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,680
love you deeply.

326
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,280
And that love

327
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,240
will never fade.

328
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,760
And besides,

329
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,480
you have your favorite lollipops.

330
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,000
And I

331
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,040
will always by your side.

332
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
[Look, look!]

333
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
Stars are about to align.

334
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,960
What are they looking at?

335
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,960
Saturn and Jupiter.

336
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,560
They're at their closest point

337
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,320
in 400 years.

338
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,360
Which one is Saturn,

339
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,640
and which one is Jupiter?

340
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,440
It's actually quite easy.

341
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,600
Jupiter's brighter than the others.

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,200
Saturn's a bit dimmer,

343
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
but it's got

344
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,680
this cool golden ring

345
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,680
around it.

346
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,440
See?

347
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,440
When'd you get into stargazing?

348
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
You know,

349
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm class monitor,

350
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
student union prez,

351
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,760
and top student in Xiangbei.

352
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,640
Why

353
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
do them get so close?

354
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,640
Some say

355
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,600
every star in the universe

356
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
will eventually meet.

357
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,320
Jupiter and Saturn

358
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
[took 400 years]

359
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
[to make it.]

360
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
It's like people in this world.

361
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,440
You will

362
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,080
find your someone special.

363
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,840
Just like...

364
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,080
Silly.

365
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
Thanks for riding

366
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,960
[the carousel with me for so long.]

367
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,480
You said that

368
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,040
two opposite stars

369
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,520
can take centuries to meet?

370
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,600
It's rare, so it's extra special

371
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,400
when it does happen.

372
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,640
Why do they

373
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,920
meet up?

374
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,040
Because

375
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,960
everything

376
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,920
in this world

377
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,760
has an attractive force.

378
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,040
Just like between stars,

379
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,480
between the moon and the Earth,

380
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,680
and even

381
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,200
between people.

382
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,160
That reminds me

383
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,240
of when I was a kid,

384
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,080
I made a promise with a bud

385
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,920
to go to space and see the stars

386
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,680
together when we grow up.

387
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,920
The one

388
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,640
who betrayed you?

389
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Wonder

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,480
where he is now

391
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,240
and if he's doing well.

392
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,360
Maybe

393
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,520
he's looking at

394
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,520
the starry sky as you,

395
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
who knows?

396
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,840
[Sorry, Mengyu.]

397
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,560
[Gotta deal with some team stuff.]

398
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,120
[Let's catch up later.]

399
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,880
You saw, right?

400
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,120
[I waited here like a fool]

401
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,320
[for three hours.]

402
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,040
Thought he'd

403
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,600
love my writing,

404
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,160
but he doesn't care at all.

405
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,480
Maybe no one

406
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,440
cares, huh?

407
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,640
That's not true.

408
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,080
I love your writing.

409
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,600
I've read all your essays.

410
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,760
You're just like them.

411
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,400
Xu Mengyu!

412
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,760
November 20th:

413
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,240
Starting from tomorrow,

414
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,120
from the dawn of the very next day,

415
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,360
you will throw yourself

416
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,600
into the journey

417
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
with all your might,

418
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,240
you'll find that all you seek is won.

419
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,480
January 1st:

420
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Never have I felt life's

421
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,120
generous gifts,

422
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,040
until I saw my mother's face

423
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,520
has wrinkles,

424
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,560
until each grain

425
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,440
whispered tales

426
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,600
of seasons' toil,

427
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,080
until every meeting with you

428
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,280
brought smiles.

429
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,840
March 14th:

430
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,240
As the guardian

431
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,320
lamp dims,

432
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,640
I realize that

433
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,960
nothing

434
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,120
stands eternal.

435
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,680
[White sneakers,]

436
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
[now yellow with disuse,]

437
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
[and aged houses,]

438
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,960
[now cloaked in moss's hue.]

439
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,080
[Could there be]

440
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
[one who loves you?]

441
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,840
[A love that lasts,]

442
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
[until the end of life's night.]

443
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,000
Xu Mengyu!

444
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,520
I know it was your birthday,

445
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,000
and I know you love stars,

446
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,680
for you shine as brightly

447
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,400
as they do.

448
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,240
It's okay if you don't see me.

449
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
But I'll always be here for you,

450
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,040
to protect and support you.

451
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,560
I don't need your support,

452
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,440
[I don't need your protection.]

453
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,600
I don't want your pity.

454
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,440
Xu Mengyu!

455
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,560
I'll always be here for you.

456
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,880
Look.

457
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,520
They're aligning.

458
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,520
Hey, Xia Qingtian!

459
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,360
Hey, Chen Luyang.

460
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,560
Going for JU!

461
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,560
Me too!

462
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,160
I'll be with you.

463
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,000
I'll always be with you.

464
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,320
I'll always

465
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,880
always always be with you.

466
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:48,320
Stars, you hear me?

467
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,640
You know,

468
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,000
when they seem to

469
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,000
meet up in the sky?

470
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,760
That's just an illusion from down here.

471
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,320
They're still way,

472
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,840
way far apart.

473
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,640
You nerds're good

474
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,400
at killing the mood.

475
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,000
I was feeling

476
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,160
all romantic about this.

477
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,880
Yeah. It's romantic.

478
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,720
Been over 400 years

479
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,800
since they've

480
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
got this close.

481
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,080
After 400 years,

482
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,760
right?

483
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,800
And we're here to see it.

484
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,080
Every star

485
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
has its own path.

486
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,280
They get close, then they split up.

487
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,680
The farthest distance between them

488
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,560
can reach over 810 million kilometers.

489
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,600
And it'll take another 60 years

490
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,040
before they get this close again.

491
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,680
Don't get all mushy.

492
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,400
When you're old,

493
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,320
I'll still be here.

494
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,840
Lan Jinghui.

495
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,040
You ever think

496
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,280
your mom's surprise might be

497
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,640
sending you off to study overseas?

498
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,880
I hadn't

499
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,320
really thought about it.

500
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,760
But if that's really

501
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,840
the case,

502
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
should I go or not?

503
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,600
It's up to you.

504
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,960
Your opinion matters.

505
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,640
I said, it's up to you.

506
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Alright.

507
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,760
Gotta give it some serious thought.

508
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,640
What are you looking at?

509
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,640
Stars.

510
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,000
What's so fun about looking at stars?

511
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,200
Mom said that

512
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,200
when you

513
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,720
miss someone,

514
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,560
you look up at the stars.

515
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,800
Stars will tell us

516
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,240
where that person is?

517
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,040
They will.
