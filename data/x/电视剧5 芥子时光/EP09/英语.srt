00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
The inequality states that

4
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,000
√2/4 AB

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,840
≤ √2/4

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,440
(2+ √2 R^2 )

7
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,960
= √2/2 +

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,680
R^2

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
the maximum area is obtained

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
when A=B.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
You got it?

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Yeah.

13
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,280
Crystal clear.

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Alright, it's getting late.

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,720
Let's call it a day.

16
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,800
Lan Jinghui,

17
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,840
aren't you going home?

18
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,640
I...

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,520
Will study a bit more.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
I must be hearing things.

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,760
What's the matter?

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Worried that I'll improve secretly?

23
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,640
It would be best if you did.

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
Did you hear him? It'd be best if you did.

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
Both of you just look down on me.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,520
You all look down on me so much?

27
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Young man, you should watch

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,040
where you're going when riding a bike.

29
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,880
Sorry, sorry.

30
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,600
Do you still want these?

31
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Go on.

32
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,640
So sorry.

33
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,000
Just go to school.

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Alright.

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,160
Be careful on the road.

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Sorry, sorry.

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,560
Go on.

39
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
I won't just let him off the hook!

40
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Academic success isn't a pass to violence!

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,000
That's not possible.

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,400
My son would never hit anyone.

43
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
There's definitely a misunderstanding.

44
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,400
You're his mother.

45
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,720
For sure, you'd defend your son.

46
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
You owe us an explanation!

47
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,360
Here, here, honey.

48
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,520
Now your son is back.

49
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,400
Dong...

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Come here and explain everything to me.

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,000
What's going on?

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,240
Let me get this straight.

53
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,880
I pay you to tutor my son,

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,920
not to hit him.

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Come on, hon.

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,000
Alright.

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,520
If he's confused, can't you guide him?

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,440
Why did you have to resort to hitting?

59
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,080
Auntie,

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
please calm down, OK?

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,200
Shh, shh, hon.

62
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,080
Xiong,

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,760
please tell me,

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
was it like

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,080
what your mother said?

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,360
Xiong,

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
listen to me.

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,000
I need to do

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,320
a very important thing later,

70
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,240
so let's finish

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,520
our homework first, OK?

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
Come on, Xiong, stop eating.

73
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,080
Finish it and then you can eat.

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,280
Let's work on this one.

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,240
Xiong, look.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,680
This matching problem is very simple.

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Let's finish it and end the session, OK?

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Come on, Xiong, finish the problem.

79
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Come on.

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,880
No, I don't want to study!

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,280
No, I don't want to study!

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,880
Xiong, it's OK.

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
Don't cry, Xiong.

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,640
Xiong, what happened?

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Xiong?

86
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,240
Why did you hit him?

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,640
Xiong, where does it hurt?

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
No, auntie,

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,240
please listen to me.

90
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
Can't you teach him gently?

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,360
Why did you hit him?

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,480
No, auntie, I didn't hit him.

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,280
If you didn't hit him,

94
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Why is he crying so hard?

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,040
There, there, sweetie,

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,240
Shh, shh, shh.

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,880
Sorry auntie,

98
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,760
how about this...

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,320
Explain to me before you leave.

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,160
Auntie, here's the thing...

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,120
The thing is...

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,760
I have a

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,480
very pressing matter.

104
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,320
I need to take care of it. Now, it's...

105
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,200
You owe me an explanation.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
Why did you hit him?

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm really running late...

108
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,640
I can't explain it in just a few words.

109
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,560
Don't you leave before you explain this!

110
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,280
Sorry, auntie.

111
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
I really have to go now.

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
I'll explain to you another day.

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,400
Xiong,

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,760
Alright, alright.

115
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
here, here,

116
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,640
hon.

117
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,400
Boy, are you OK?

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960
You were riding too fast.

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,800
It wasn't my fault.

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
If you're fine, then I'll be leaving now.

121
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,960
That day, were you crying

122
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,560
because you were scared of

123
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,560
being scolded?

124
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,720
How could that be?

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
He's just a little kid.

126
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,480
If you didn't hit him,

127
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
how could he possibly have scratched you?

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,320
Xiong, don't be scared.

129
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,800
My son couldn't possibly hit anyone.

130
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
You're still defending your son!

131
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,640
Auntie,

132
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,920
actually, you can check

133
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,160
if Xiong has any bruises.

134
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,240
What? You intended to hurt him?

135
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,120
If you hadn't hit him,

136
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
he wouldn't have cried so hard.

137
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,560
Come on, Xiong.

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Xiong's mom,

139
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
isn't there some misunderstanding?

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,440
Dong is known

141
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
as a well-behaved student.

142
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,520
That's why I recommended him

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
to tutor your son.

144
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,600
Ma,

145
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,160
I just felt sorry for them,

146
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,000
a widow and her son on their own,

147
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
so I kindly let Ling Dong

148
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
tutor my kid.

149
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,720
I offered generous tutoring fee, didn't I?

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Here's your money.

151
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,200
Take it!

152
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:27,880
Mom.

153
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,680
For your information,

154
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,480
my son couldn't possibly lie,

155
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
and even less likely to hit anyone!

156
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
How could she accuse you like that?

157
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,600
Mom, it's OK.

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
I don't care what she says about me.

159
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,600
This was all my fault, my fault.

160
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,560
Let's head inside.

161
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Let's go.

162
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,560
Yeah, mom.

163
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
- Let's go inside.
- Let's go.

164
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm going, mom.

165
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
Morning, see ya!

166
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,320
Catch up, you!

167
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,680
Good morning, Mr. president.

168
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Lan Jinghui,

169
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
you've got to be kidding me.

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
You're taking

171
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
so many parking spots all for yourself,

172
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,480
how are others supposed to park?

173
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,000
Move me then.

174
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,200
I am discussing this issue

175
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
with you very seriously.

176
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,880
Move me aside.

177
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm doing this for your own good, got it?

178
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Just move me.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,480
Unreasonable!

180
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Slow rider, you finally made it.

181
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,320
You're a 17-year-old kid, but you lack the

182
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
energy typical of someone of your age.

183
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,240
I saved some parking spots for you.

184
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,240
Pick one.

185
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,360
Every year, many people

186
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
die in traffic accidents,

187
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
and among them, non-motor vehicles

188
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
make up 80 percent.

189
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
It means I value life more than you do.

190
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
You know,

191
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,080
you're quite a weirdo.

192
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,160
I saved a parking spot for you.

193
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Instead of showing gratitude,

194
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,920
you cursed me!

195
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,520
What did you do after school yesterday?

196
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
I...

197
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
Nothing, really.

198
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,120
I...

199
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I was playing basketball with Ma Yiming.

200
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Enough.

201
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,840
It's rare that I come early.

202
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
If I don't hurry to the classroom,

203
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
the teacher won't commend me.

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,680
Oh, by the way,

205
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,320
I bought too much breakfast.

206
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,280
Have some.

207
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,720
Later!

208
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,040
Yo, I haven't finished yet!

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,760
Oops,

210
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,840
sorry.

211
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Go ahead, wipe them out.

212
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,560
This is incorrect.

213
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
How could an atom with the electron

214
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,320
configuration of 1s22s1 produce a spectrum?

215
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,280
Wha... what?

216
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,520
What's wrong?

217
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,160
Here.

218
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,120
1s22s1 is in its ground state.

219
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,520
1s22s22p1

220
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,840
and 1s22s22p3 are in their ground states.

221
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,280
They won't undergo electron transitions,

222
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,240
so the correct answer should be 1s22s22p1.

223
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,160
The ground state doesn't transition.

224
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,880
What is the ground state?

225
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
Why do atoms

226
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,960
need to be excited,

227
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,120
and why do they undergo transitions?

228
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,000
K-shell 1s,

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,760
L-shell 2s 2p,

230
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
just remember this sequence,

231
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,120
what other than these are not the ground state,

232
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
and are the excited state.

233
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Excited state will transition.

234
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,320
Got it?

235
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Write it down.

236
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,480
Alright.

237
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,520
1s

238
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,880
L shell,

239
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,880
2s 2p

240
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,640
K shell.

241
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,480
It's getting late.

242
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
Take this chemistry notebook,

243
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,040
and review it at home.

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
I've marked some key points.

245
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
Read through them.

246
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm heading home.

247
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,040
Wait up, let's leave together!

248
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,440
What is it?

249
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,680
It's a phone.

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
What? I don't need it.

251
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Why don't you want it?

252
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
Didn't your phone break?

253
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,120
I've got an extra at home.

254
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
Just take it.

255
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,160
I told you, I don't want it.

256
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,280
I've got an extra.

257
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Just use it for now, OK?

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,560
Lan Jinghui,

259
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,440
did you see everything

260
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
that day at my apartment?

261
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,640
I...

262
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,200
I just happened to be passing by.

263
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,920
Right, passing by...

264
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,240
You are really presumptuous,

265
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,760
you know?

266
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,600
It's not about

267
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,840
me being presumptuous.

268
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,360
I just happen

269
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,120
to have an extra phone.

270
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Just take it,

271
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,720
put it in. It's fine.

272
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,840
I told you. I don't want it.

273
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,840
It's OK.

274
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,000
Lan Jinghui.

275
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,040
I've got plenty of phones.

276
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,160
Take this for now.

277
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Your phone doesn't work, right?

278
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,880
Don't make me repeat myself,

279
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,320
Lan Jinghui.

280
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,760
Just use this for now.

281
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,680
I don't want to repeat either.

282
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,560
Just put it...

283
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
Lan Jinghui!

284
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
Did I ever say I need a phone?

285
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,720
And before, at the bike parking,

286
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,280
in the cafeteria!

287
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,160
For your information,

288
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
I don't need your charity!

289
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,160
You don't want it?

290
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,560
Fine.

291
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,680
You don't deserve it.

292
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Ling Dong.

293
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,320
Could you loan me

294
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,120
your chemistry notes?

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,320
I'll return them to you soon.

296
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,440
Ling Dong, you dork!

297
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,640
Good intentions taken for granted!

298
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,320
You idiot!

299
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,280
Do you have a grudge against the hoop?

300
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,880
Are you a ghost?

301
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,360
Did you have another argument

302
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,920
with Ling Dong?

303
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
Jinghui, I'm not criticizing you,

304
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,840
but as a man,

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
you should be more magnanimous.

306
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,400
Don't always be at odds with him.

307
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,520
Just beat it.

308
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you know?

309
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
I see you bullying him all the time.

310
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,120
He didn't hold any grudges against you,

311
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,320
and came over to help you form a band.

312
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,840
We've been at peace for just a few days.

313
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,720
Here we go again!

314
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
So I'm the only one

315
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,880
to blame

316
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,960
in this whole mess?

317
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Chalk and cheese.

318
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,480
What's it all about?

319
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,200
I came over to talk with good intentions.

320
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,960
Why did he get so angry?

321
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,760
Coming!

322
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,920
I got it. Just focus on your study.

323
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,520
Who is it?

324
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,960
What for?

325
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:39,920
Come in, please.

326
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,920
Ling Dong is also home.

327
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
Xiong, apologize to Mr. Ling.

328
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,760
Mr. Ling, I'm sorry.

329
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,760
I didn't mean to

330
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
scratch your face that day.

331
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,880
You didn't hit me either.

332
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
I was just so scared,

333
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
so I cried.

334
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,280
He was crying all day,

335
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,880
and I didn't know what was happening.

336
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,480
It seems I misunderstood Ling Dong.

337
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,600
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,160
He's your son.

339
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,520
It's your duty to educate him.

340
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,440
You shouldn't have showed up and accused

341
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,640
my son without knowing the full story,

342
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,800
right?

343
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,000
You are right.

344
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,120
He's just a kid.

345
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,360
I sincerely apologize for the trouble.

346
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,960
Please keep the money,

347
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,600
and regarding the extra,

348
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,840
consider that a small gesture.

349
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,720
That won't be necessary, thanks.

350
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,640
I accept your apology,

351
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
but I will only take what I've earned.

352
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,960
Just keep the rest.

353
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,640
Er...

354
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,400
OK.

355
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,440
We won't bother you any longer.

356
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,280
Wait, auntie.

357
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
May I ask why

358
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,800
you suddenly

359
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,560
changed your attitude?

360
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
About that...

361
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,120
Xiong,

362
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,920
maybe you should tell Mr. Ling.

363
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,360
Mr. John Doe told me to apologize.

364
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
He said if I didn't come,

365
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,040
I would...

366
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,320
I would be infamous forever.

367
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,280
We'll be leaving now.

368
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,120
Sorry for everything.

369
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,800
Let me walk you out.

370
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,440
Goodbye.

371
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,000
What's on your mind?

372
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,320
Nothing.

373
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,960
Then I'll get back to my assignment.

374
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,880
Go ahead.

375
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,000
[The great me is truly a genius.]

376
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,680
[I've got all figured out.]

377
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,760
[Can you believe it?]

378
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
[Was it you who went to talk to Xiong?]

379
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
[I have something to tell you.]

380
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,120
[Meet me at the racetrack.]

381
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,800
Mom, I'm going out for a while.

382
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,160
Where are you going?

383
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,360
Just some stuff. I'll be right back.

384
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,680
How was it?

385
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,200
Awesome!

386
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
You were good out there!

387
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,480
Of course.

388
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,520
[Dressing in red makes you go faster.]

389
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,400
[Absolutely.]

390
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,920
Lan Jinghui!

391
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,800
I've always felt

392
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm the best.

393
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Then what does that make us?

394
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,360
You are awesome!

395
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
We're pretty awesome too.

396
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,600
Lan Jinghui!

397
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,280
What?

398
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,760
About Xiong...

399
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,440
Come again?

400
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,080
I said, about Xiong...

401
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,960
What about it?

402
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,600
Thanks a lot!

403
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,760
Actually, the thing is,

404
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,640
no matter what,

405
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,840
I completely understand.

406
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,760
Right?

407
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,720
And...

408
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,280
What's up?

409
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,320
I was indeed being impulsive that day.

410
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,120
Pardon?

411
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,320
I said, the other day,

412
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,440
I was indeed being impulsive!

413
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,920
I can't hear you, what?

414
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,880
I said, the other day,

415
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,720
I was indeed being impulsive!

416
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,320
You were impulsive, OK.

417
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
And...

418
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,800
And what?

419
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,280
What I said was indeed

420
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,120
quite harsh.

421
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,280
So...

422
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,160
Yeah.

423
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,120
So what?

424
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,600
We're cool now.

425
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm done.

426
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:55,800
See you.

427
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,480
Just a few bland words and he left.

428
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,680
There's no sincerity.

429
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,480
[Who wrote that?]

430
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,400
[Who was it?]

431
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,440
[Who wrote this on the blackboard?]

432
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,840
[Who is it?]

433
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,600
[I don't know.]

434
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
[It was already there when I came in.]

435
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,400
Sure, you wouldn't know.

436
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,160
Because this

437
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,840
is clearly someone admitting a big mistake

438
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,120
and apologizing shamelessly

439
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,480
in front of the whole class.

440
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,520
What kind of huge mistake would that be?

441
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,480
Which influential figure did he mess with?

442
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,800
He had to write such huge words.

443
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,720
You're exaggerating.

444
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,640
I think it was just written casually.

445
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,600
That's not true.

446
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,920
Let me tell you.

447
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I know better than anyone

448
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,080
the feeling of writing a self-critique

449
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,360
after making a mistake.

450
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,640
That feeling of

451
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
regret after realizing

452
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,760
you've done wrong,

453
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,240
the annoyance after good intentions

454
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
are taken for granted.

455
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
That torment in the heart,

456
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
the complex feeling of being

457
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,760
too ashamed to admit the mistake.

458
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,080
Thinking about it,

459
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,280
I really feel

460
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,280
sorry for that guy.

461
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,800
What was he doing earlier?

462
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,440
Now he brought this out.

463
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,600
Lan Jinghui,

464
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,160
you sounded like it was written for you.

465
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,240
Do you know who wrote it?

466
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,920
Nope.

467
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,240
He didn't dare to sign his name.

468
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,160
How would I know who it is?

469
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,880
It was such good handwriting.

470
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
it's a pity to erase it.

471
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,400
The writing was so good.

472
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,200
Who do you think wrote it?

473
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,440
Help me figure it out.

474
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,600
Come on.

475
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,840
Midterms are coming up.

476
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
These are some key and difficult areas.

477
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,960
Finish up and give them to me tomorrow.

478
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,480
I don't want to.

479
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm in such a bad mood

480
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,880
that I can't even grip a pen.

481
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,360
What about your previous homework?

482
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm not like some people,

483
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,880
so petty.

484
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,280
Lan Jinghui,

485
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
I will always be your uncle.

486
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
Who cares?

487
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,800
Give me a pen.

488
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,680
Low-energy atoms

489
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,720
are called atoms in ground state.

490
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,520
When the electrons of a ground state atom

491
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,360
absorb energy,

492
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
they'll transition to higher energy levels,

493
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,920
becoming an excited state atom.

494
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,400
Geometry.

495
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Sequence!

496
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,120
Geometry!

497
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Sequence!

498
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,920
It's definitely geometry!

499
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,240
It's definitely sequence.

500
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,800
The last question is definitely geometry.

501
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
The big question is definitely sequence!

502
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,880
Got to be geometry.

503
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,840
Typically for midterms,

504
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,280
geometry is the final question.

505
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,360
Ms. Fang has been

506
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,040
focusing on sequences lately.

507
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,520
I think it's going to be sequence.

508
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm certain it's sequence.

509
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,440
I'm betting on sequence.

510
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
I feel it's geometry.

511
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,160
It's definitely geometry.

512
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,200
Geometry.

513
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Mengyu, what's your take on this?

514
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,360
Geometry and sequence

515
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,200
are both my strengths.

516
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,800
Whatever comes up doesn't bother me.

517
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
If only I could be in the

518
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,360
same exam room as Mengyu.

519
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,280
What are you dreaming about?

520
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,280
How could we possibly

521
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,040
get assigned in the same exam room?

522
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
The class rep is betting on sequence.

523
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
I'm changing my bet.

524
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,400
Me too.

525
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
Sequence.

526
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,240
What do you think? What's your bet?

527
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,160
What's your bet?

528
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,080
You want to know?

529
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,840
Yep.

530
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:32,880
Geometry.

531
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,760
Geometry!

532
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,560
Geometry.

533
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
Geometry, it is!

534
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,160
Ling Dong is betting on geometry.

535
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,400
You're still on sequence?

536
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,720
Forget about sequence.

537
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,280
It's absolutely geometry!

538
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,520
Geometry.

539
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,560
It's got to be sequence!

540
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,560
It will be geometry for sure!

541
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,200
Xiaohua,

542
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,240
this is specially ordered for you.

543
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,240
A huge pork knuckle.

544
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,880
I heard that eating this before an exam

545
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,040
can help you score high.

546
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,880
It's gigantic.

547
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,480
Let me have a bite.

548
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,360
No way.

549
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,160
This is for Xiaohua only.

550
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
But it's so big.

551
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,800
I can't finish it by myself.

552
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,920
You must finish it.

553
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,680
And you have to finish these too.

554
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,480
Eating eggs can get you full score.

555
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,960
They usually

556
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,840
eat eggs with dough sticks.

557
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,440
Eating only eggs will get you zero.

558
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,080
Too bad they don't offer koi fish in here.

559
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,640
I heard eating koi can improve your luck,

560
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,640
and it's particularly effective.

561
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,440
Isn't koi a decorative fish?

562
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,440
Can you eat it?

563
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,080
Eat carp fish instead, silly.

564
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,640
My cousin got in Jing University last year

565
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,280
because he

566
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,560
ate carp fish all year long.

567
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,520
Really?

568
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,440
That theory

569
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,160
has no scientific basis.

570
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,800
Of course, it's false.

571
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,320
Superstitions are not trustworthy.

572
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
Otherwise, why do we go to school?

573
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,040
Right?

574
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,240
Mom,

575
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
why is it all fish today?

576
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,840
I crave fish.

577
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,680
Exactly,

578
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
my sweetheart wants it.

579
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,800
Look how skinny he is.

580
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,720
Bon appetit.

581
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,560
I'm going to

582
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,200
finish them all!

583
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,320
Guys, get ready.

584
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,200
We're about to start the exam soon.

585
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
What's the matter, Lan Jinghui?

586
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,640
Ma'am, my stomach hurts.

587
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,120
I need to use the restroom.

588
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,920
We're about to start.

589
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
I can't hold it anymore.

590
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
OK, make it fast.

591
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,760
I'll be right back.

592
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,040
Hurry up, OK?

593
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,640
Alright.

594
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,960
Guys, prepare yourselves.

595
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,160
Just relax.

596
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,280
Do your best.

597
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,840
Alright, everyone,

598
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,920
put your phones on mute,

599
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
and bring them to the front.

600
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,920
Return to your seat.

601
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,280
You've returned.

602
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,080
Yes, I'm back.

603
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,480
Get to it.

604
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,000
Alright.

605
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,800
Bi Peng.

606
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,200
Stand up.

607
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,560
Ma'am...

608
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,200
Stand up.

609
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Now!

610
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,000
This is unacceptable.

611
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:55,840
You.

612
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,360
And you.

613
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,200
Come on, hand them over.

614
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,280
Do you have anything else to say?

615
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,560
Ma'am,

616
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,280
Lan Jinghui didn't hand in his either.

617
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,200
Stop right there.

618
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,160
What...

619
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
What do you want?

620
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,800
I'll give you all my money.

621
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,440
I don't want that.

622
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,320
I have plenty of money.

623
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,240
Come here.

624
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,640
I've only got

625
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,320
a question for you.

626
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,040
I heard my brother bullied you.

627
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,560
That Ling dude,

628
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,000
the one who usually tutors you.

629
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,880
Did he really hit you?

630
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,320
It's no use.

631
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,960
That doesn't work on me at all.

632
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,080
Speak up.

633
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,440
Tell me the truth.

634
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,600
Last chance.

635
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,320
Did he really hit you or not?

636
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,120
Not really.

637
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,320
Then what about

638
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,080
the scratch on his face?

639
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,080
I scratched him with a ruler.

640
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,360
Is it that hard to

641
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,640
tell the truth to people?

642
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,160
After you get back,

643
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
tell your mother the same things

644
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,800
you've told me.

645
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,080
Did you get that?

646
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,840
If you didn't say it,

647
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,680
I would know, you know.

648
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,960
And you have to know...

649
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,920
Go.

650
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,480
By the way,

651
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,200
if someone asks you

652
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,680
who I am,

653
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,720
just tell them

654
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,480
my name is

655
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,440
John Doe!
