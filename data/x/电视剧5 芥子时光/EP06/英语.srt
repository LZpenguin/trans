00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,000
Enter.

4
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,240
Hey, Mr. Zhang.

5
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,680
Ling Dong, what can I do for you?

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,920
Mr. Zhang,

7
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,560
about the physics competition

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
you mentioned last time,

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,320
I've decided to give it a try.

10
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,680
Great.

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,600
That's good news.

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,400
However, this means

13
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,600
I won't be able to participate in

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
the talent competition.

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll have to quit.

16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
You've got to think this over.

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,000
It would be a pity if you dropped out.

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,200
There's a scheduling conflict,

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,200
and I feel the physics competition

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,440
is more important to me.

21
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Alright, I got it.

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,120
Let me handle it.

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,000
As for you,

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
just focus on the physics competition.

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you, sir.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,960
[No problem.]

About this...

41
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
I've already told you.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,920
Don't bother.

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Whoa, impressive.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,200
You pulled strings behind the scenes.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,160
That was really unexpected.

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,360
Let's get one thing clear, OK?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
You were the one pulling strings,

48
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,800
not me.

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,440
You can't just quit this competition

62

We're now rivals.

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Good luck, Little Jokester.

64
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,160
Ms. Fang, this isn't fair.

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,960
For such an event like the talent contest,

66
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,200
Ling Dong can't just quit like that.

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,200
Ling Dong has a physics competition

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
at the end of the month,

69
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
Mr. Zhang has given special permission.

70
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,960
Do you have an issue with that?

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,160
Not at all.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,720
He had an exit plan

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,880
even before he applied.

74
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,200
That's so low.

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,800
Do you really think

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know about the little schemes

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,720
you've been doing behind the scenes?

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,320
I...

79
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,240
I think you're looking for tasks to do.

80
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,000
Since you're so free,

81
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,880
here's some basic exercises

82
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,920
I've prepared especially for you.

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,160
Take it, complete it,

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
and submit it to Ling Dong for review.

85
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,000
No,

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
Ms. Fang, this isn't fair.

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,040
Xiaohua,

88
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,760
what's the matter?

89
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,160
Ms. Fang,

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,280
I want to withdraw from the contest, too.

91
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,880
Why?

92
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,840
I just don't want to compete.

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,720
Xiaohua,

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Ling Dong's withdrawal from the contest

95
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,480
was because he had a legitimate reason.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,360
He will participate in a physics contest,

97
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
and Mr. Zhang has given him permission.

98
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,760
If you want to withdraw

99
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
simply because

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,840
you don't want to compete.

101
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,040
I just can't agree to that,

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,240
and I don't have the authority

103
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,600
to approve your withdrawal.

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,280
But Ms. Fang,

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,080
I don't have any talents.

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,600
I...

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
You know,

108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,520
I think

109
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,960
you lack confidence.

110
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,000
I believe this is a good opportunity

111
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,400
for you to train and improve.

112
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,000
But...

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,520
No 'buts'.

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,280
Alright, it's almost time for class.

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,560
You should go back.

116
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,720
Thanks, Ms. Fang.

117
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,040
Xiaohua,

118
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
just try your best to prepare for it.

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,760
I'm really looking forward to your

120
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,400
performance in the talent competition.

121
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,760
I believe in you.

122
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,640
Good luck!

123
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,840
Go back to class now.

124
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,560
Go ahead.

125
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,800
Now let's discuss

126
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,040
the voting for

127
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,760
this talent competition.

128
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,200
Many students from each class

129
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,520
haven't voted yet.

130
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I believe it's

131
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,600
our Student Union's duty

132
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
to organize this contest properly.

133
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,360
Everyone knows

134
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,720
that this talent competition

135
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,080
is an opportunity to represent our school,

136
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,040
so it must be

137
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,840
the most outstanding student.

138
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
Ling Dong is a suitable choice,

139
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
but unfortunately, he withdrew.

140
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,200
Ling Dong withdrew,

141
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,160
but there are other candidates.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
He's the only option.

143
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,120
But now,

144
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,280
among those with high votes,

145
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,600
there isn't anyone particularly

146
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,200
outstanding to represent our school.

147
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,360
How can there not be?

148
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,400
Mengyu, you're also

149
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,360
among the top nominees.

150
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not good enough.

151
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,400
You're still better than

152
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
that Xiaohua, aren't you?

153
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,160
You're making it hard for me

154
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,560
but I think the Student Union

155
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,520
should really

156
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,400
set a good example.

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,960
Then it should definitely be you.

158
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,320
Mengyu has competed before

159
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
and has experience.

160
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,840
Plus,

161
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,280
she's the president of our Student Union.

162
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
It's her responsibility.

163
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,240
Mengyu, at this point,

164
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,640
we don't need modesty.

165
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,000
After all, participating in the contest

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
is about representing our school.

167
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
It's not a trivial matter.

168
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,560
Alright then.

169
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
But just to be clear,

170
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
I'm not trying to hog the limelight.

171
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,640
It's just that we

172
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,440
genuinely need someone

173
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,160
to represent our school.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,080
Then I will certainly try my best

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,400
to be a role model for everyone.

176
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,840
After the meeting,

177
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,600
please help

178
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,080
encourage your classmates to vote.

179
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,000
It's for the benefit

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,880
of our school, after all.

181
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,680
OK.

182
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,720
That'll be all.

183
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,560
Ma Yiming,

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,600
Mengyu.

185
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,840
The photo on the flyer

186
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,600
was a bit unflattering.

187
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,880
Sorry, Mengyu,

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,640
I didn't realize you disliked it.

189
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,080
And about that ribbon,

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,240
my name was printed too small.

191
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,080
I won't do it again, I promise.

192
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,640
Oh, that's not what I meant.

193
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,400
Mengyu, you don't have to explain.

194
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,520
I heard everything.

195
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,000
You're working too hard for the contest.

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,280
I should have given it more thought.

197
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:42,960
Don't worry.

198
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,760
I definitely won't

199
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,480
pull tricks like that anymore.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Who told you to stop?

201
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,480
If you're going to do it, do it right.

202
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,720
I'll send you a photo of mine later.

203
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,400
Use this one.

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,400
Aye, aye, ma'am, consider it done!

205
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,160
Please,

206
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,400
vote for Xu Mengyu from

207
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,120
Class 5, Grade 11!

208
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,640
Thanks!

209
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,240
Please give Xu Mengyu your vote,

210
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
thanks a lot!

211
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,040
Please vote for Xu Mengyu!

212
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,320
Thanks.

213
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,240
Please don't vote for me anymore.

214
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,640
Don't worry, Xiaohua,

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,920
I will definitely support you in this.

216
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,520
No, that's not what I'm...

217
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
No need to say more.

218
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
We're classmates.

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
I will surely have your back.

220
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,520
Guys, please vote for Xiaohua!

221
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
Vote for Xiaohua!

222
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Please, everyone,

223
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
don't vote for me!

224
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
Don't vote for Xiao Xiaohua.

225
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,280
I noticed yesterday,

226
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,560
by the end of voting,

227
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,960
Mengyu was still in the lead.

228
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960
It's definitely going to be Mengyu.

229
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,200
I feel that way as well.

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,240
[Now, we will announce,]

231
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,840
[after voting]

232
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,160
[and discussion,]

233
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,280
[the one representing Chenjun High School]

234
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,800
[in the talent competition will be]

235
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,280
[Xiao Xiaohua]

236
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
[from Class 5, Grade 11.]

237
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,520
[She will represent Chenjun High School]

238
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,080
[in the final qualification of the citywide]

239
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,760
[high school students' talent competition.]

240
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
[Let's extend]

241
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,360
[warm congratulations to Xiao Xiaohua.]

242
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,240
Xiaohua, that's awesome!

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,560
You've surprised us all!

244
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,480
Xiaohua?

245
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Xiaohua.

246
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,040
Xiaohua!

247
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,640
Are you happy?

248
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
We're screwed!

249
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,880
Our school can

250
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
kiss the award goodbye this year.

251
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,320
Mengyu,

252
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,400
it'd be better if you had been elected.

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,920
It's fine.

254
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Liu Shu,

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
What's that supposed to mean?

256
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
Just as it sounds.

257
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,400
Can't you understand?

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,960
Her singing is so off-key,

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,160
she's lost all sense of pitch.

260
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,640
Am I not allowed to

261
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
question the result?

262
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,520
But everyone is willing

263
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,280
to vote for her,

264
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
to choose her.

265
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Are you jealous?

266
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,080
I think

267
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,840
everyone just wants to see a joke.

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,280
No wonder they call her Little Jokester.

269
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
Liu Shu,

270
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,920
I have a question for you.

271
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,480
Why do you

272
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,400
call her Little Jokester?

273
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,240
Why can't she

274
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
participate in the talent competition?

275
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,040
This is about representing the school.

276
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
Is she capable of doing that?

277
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,120
She's definitely capable

278
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,480
because I say so!

279
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,920
Congratulations, Xiaohua.

280
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,160
It seems that the task

281
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,360
to represent our school

282
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,320
has been entrusted to you this time.

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
You must give it your all,

284
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,160
and not to bring shame to our school.

285
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,320
Xu Mengyu represented our school last year

286
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,560
in the competition.

287
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
This year, it's the Little Jokester.

288
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,800
The contrast is a bit too harsh, isn't it?

289
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,840
I think Xiaohua is quite good.

290
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm very optimistic about her.

291
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,440
Maybe she can pull off a surprise victory.

292
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,040
A surprise victory?

293
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,160
Cut it out!

294
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,440
With her singing skills,

295
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,240
[our school]

296
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,880
[is likely to end up at the bottom.]

297
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
[So annoying.]

298
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
[I voted for her just for fun.]

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,760
[How did I know she'd get elected?]

300
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
[Now we're in for a spectacle.]

301
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,240
[So annoying.]

302
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,120
[How could this be?]

303
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,400
What are you doing,

304
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,920
Xiao Xiaohua?

305
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,000
Ling Dong?

306
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,080
Do you really want to jump?

307
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,960
I...

308
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,240
Setbacks are just experiences in life,

309
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,360
not the entirety of life.

310
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,640
Is it worth sacrificing your life

311
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,440
just to escape?

312
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,360
I didn't...

313
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,520
Do you know how many people

314
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,680
struggle to stay alive?

315
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,360
Do you realize

316
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,520
the life you're giving up so easily is

317
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,920
something many people can't even hope for?

318
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,240
Do you know?

319
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,960
Just one jump, and in an instant,

320
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,120
all the people you know,

321
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,080
the things you love,

322
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,000
will turn to nothing.

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,160
They will all become meaningless.

324
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,640
If you really jumped,

325
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,360
you might really

326
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,360
become a joke, you know?

327
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,560
Ling Dong!

328
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,560
what right do you have to call her a joke?

329
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,800
If you hadn't withdrawn,

330
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,560
would she be like this?

331
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,000
Aren't you aware of the

332
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,960
reason of my withdrawal?

333
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,880
Don't you think this

334
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,840
has nothing to do with you.

335
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
Instead of tangling with me here,

336
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,440
you'd be better off thinking about

337
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,400
how to resolve the situation.

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
You coward!

339
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
Ling Dong, I'm telling you..,

340
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,400
Lan Jinghui, you've got it wrong.

341
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,160
Ling Dong just wanted to help me.

342
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,160
You don't need to defend him.

343
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,400
Every word that came out of his...

344
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,160
He didn't...

345
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,640
Fine,

346
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,120
This whole thing,

347
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,520
I'll shoulder it with you, OK?

348
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
The world is round.

349
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,760
If you keep running away like this,

350
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,880
you'll end up back where you started,

351
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,360
right?

352
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,000
So instead of...

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,560
What are you two doing?

354
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,400
One thought I was about to kill myself,

355
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
and the other lectured me out of the blue.

356
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,960
I just came up here to

357
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,560
cry by myself for a bit.

358
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,840
Alright,

359
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,080
don't cry, don't cry.

360
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,600
Then you should have said that earlier.

361
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,320
If it's about crying,

362
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,200
I can join you.

363
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,760
Is that OK?

364
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,720
If you need to let it all out,

365
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,840
you should shout it out.

366
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,000
How?

367
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,080
Come here.

368
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,200
I'll shout, and you just repeat after me.

369
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm not Little Jokester!

370
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
I'm Xiao Xiaohua!

371
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,560
I'm not Little Jokester.

372
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm Xiao Xiaohua...

373
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,640
Louder!

374
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm not Little Jokester.

375
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm Xiao Xiaohua.

376
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Put some emotion in.

377
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,920
Shout it out with conviction!

378
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
I'm not Little Jokester!

379
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm Xiao Xiaohua!

380
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,640
That's much better.

381
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,160
You need to tell them,

382
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,560
I, Xiao Xiaohua, can do it!

383
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,480
I, Xiao Xiaohua, can definitely do it!

384
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,160
I am THE KING OF THE SCHOOL!

385
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,120
I am THE KING OF THE SCHOOL!

386
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,080
I am THE KING OF THE SCHOOL!

387
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
I am THE KING OF THE SCHOOL!

388
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Louder!

389
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,920
I am THE KING OF THE SCHOOL!

390
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,200
Who's there?

391
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,360
Who was shouting on the rooftop?

392
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
It's dangerous, come down now!

393
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,760
Run, run, run!

394
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang won't catch us.

395
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,240
How did you make it this far

396
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,320
with such a fearful nature?

397
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,720
No sighing,

398
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,080
happiness will slip away.

399
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,280
But after shouting on the rooftop,

400
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,000
do you feel a lot better?

401
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,480
But the stage isn't the rooftop.

402
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,400
With so many audiences,

403
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,520
what if I get nervous?

404
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,040
You've got me!

405
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,440
If you nail it, it's your credit.

406
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
If not, it's my fault, alright?

407
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,440
Thank you, Lan Jinghui.

408
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,640
But what are we going to perform?

409
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,880
Leave it to me.

410
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,440
What?

411
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,640
You want to form a band for her?

412
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,880
Exactly.

413
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,760
Why?

414
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
Xiaohua is afraid to do it alone,

415
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,480
so I've decided to do it with her.

416
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,400
No way, Jinghui,

417
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,880
I still have trainings.

418
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
I don't have time.

419
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,200
If we don't go together,

420
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,440
she will jump off the rooftop.

421
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,440
Are you OK with that?

422
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,320
I'm going to the rooftop now.

423
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
No, apprentice.

424
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Don't, Xiaohua!

425
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,680
Just for that "don't,"

426
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,760
for your sisterly bond,

427
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,880
it's decided then. Let's go.

428
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,840
Going to perform on stage,

429
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,920
without a good pair of shoes,

430
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,800
how am I supposed to do it?

431
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,160
Am I right?

432
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,600
Just sneakers, right?

433
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,440
I'll buy them for you.

434
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,000
The latest ones!

435
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,800
Count me in!

436
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,880
Good, that's the spirit!

437
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,600
Since you are onboard,

438
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,080
we should...

439
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,440
Not so fast! I haven't agreed yet!

440
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
Tell me your wish.

441
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,240
I don't want sneakers.

442
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,040
I can't eat them.

443
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
Rehearsals are very draining.

444
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know how much I need to eat

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,800
to make up for the energy I burn.

446
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,400
It's about food, right?

447
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,320
I'll cover your snacks for a month.

448
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,760
Happy now?

449
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,320
A month?

450
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
A quarter.

451
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,600
A semester?

452
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,480
I want unlimited snacks,

453
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,720
all-I-can-eat!

454
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,920
Here's your "all-I-can-eat."

455
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,480
Meal card?

456
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,720
It's yours now, right.

457
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
Awesome! All-I-can-eat!

458
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,720
Now that you have your unlimited snacks,

459
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,920
and you've got your new sneakers,

460
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
we'll start rehearsals tomorrow!

461
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,480
Good!

462
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,640
OK!

463
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,800
Let's go, Xiaohua.

464
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Come on, you guys!

465
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,360
On the double, y'all!

466
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,040
Take a look, pick whatever you like.

467
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,000
Not bad, Jinghui,

468
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,040
you're really going all out!

469
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,120
Not really.

470
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,000
My dad used to play music before.

471
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,560
These are just

472
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,760
a few pieces from home.

473
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
I've been playing since I was little.

474
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,200
I couldn't tell,

475
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,680
your dad was so swag!

476
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,240
But I can't play any of them.

477
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
When the time comes,

478
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,360
you just stand here,

479
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
right in the middle,

480
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,280
as our lead singer.

481
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,120
As soon as we start playing,

482
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,560
you'll definitely be

483
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,400
the center of attention.

484
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,520
Relax.

485
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,160
Come up, feel it.

486
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,040
Come on.

487
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:51,960
Alright.

488
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,080
♪Beyond the long pavilion...♪

489
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,920
That's enough, stop.

490
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,280
Tell me, what seems to be the problem?

491
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,520
Cracked.

492
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,640
Correct.

493
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,640
Let's lower the pitch

494
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,920
just a little bit,

495
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,880
a bit.

496
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,080
Again.

497
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,480
♪Beyond the long pavilion, by the ancient road,♪

498
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,000
♪grass dyes green the sky.♪

499
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,600
It's slightly better,

500
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,120
right?

501
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
But the issue is

502
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,920
the breath control, not quite there.

503
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,920
So, the solution is?

504
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,880
Tell me, Ma Yiming.

505
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Panting like a dog.

506
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,800
First, let's practice that.

507
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,720
OK, come on.

508
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,160
Together, OK?

509
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,880
Ready?

510
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,480
Three, two, one.

511
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,640
Harder.

512
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,120
You should

513
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,120
practice at home by yourself.

514
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,240
Then the second point is,

515
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,520
you must project your voice

516
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,680
outward.

517
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,520
Let's start with a vocal warm-up.

518
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,160
It goes like this.

519
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,280
That's the idea, come on.

520
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,080
Make your voice ten times louder,

521
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,040
come on, together!

522
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
I've marked

523
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,880
all the difficult parts

524
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,840
on this for you.

525
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,080
Just follow this for your practice.

526
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,160
So impressive.

527
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,680
Okey-dokey!

528
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,600
Just practice.

529
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,040
[A minus B is a positive number,]

530
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,200
[so if we use symbols]

531
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
[to represent it, it means]

532
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,160
[A is greater than B, greater than 0.]

533
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,200
Lan Jinghui?

534
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,960
Lan Jinghui!

535
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
What are you doing? Listening to music?

536
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,080
Nah.

537
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,200
My ear hurts.

538
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,800
I think water got in it

539
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,240
when I was showering last night.

540
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,240
Water got in your ear,

541
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,520
and you're still shaking your head?

542
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,080
Won't that make it worse?

543
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,560
Should I take you to the hospital?

544
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,480
No, thanks.

545
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,400
Earphones.

546
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,120
Hand them over.

547
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,520
Pay attention.

548
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,120
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,920
Alright, let's continue.

550
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,360
[If A...]

551
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,040
I heard you've been doing well lately.

552
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,520
The teachers have

553
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,080
a high opinion of you.

554
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,280
Of course!

555
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,960
Mr. Zhang,

556
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,320
I've been behaving lately.

557
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,600
I assure you I haven't caused any trouble.

558
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,480
Well, sir,

559
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,280
if there's nothing else, I'll leave.

560
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,840
Not so fast.

561
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,760
I was being sarcastic. Can't tell, huh?

562
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,040
You may leave,

563
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,920
but first,

564
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,680
show me your notes

565
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,680
from that study group of yours.

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,280
If I find them satisfactory,

567
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,600
then you can

568
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,160
leave my office.

569
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,160
Hand them over.

570
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,000
Sir, can we talk about it?

571
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,400
You see,

572
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,480
recently, I've been

573
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
busy helping classmates

574
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,640
prepare for the talent competition.

575
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,160
So, about handing in the notes,

576
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,760
can we just

577
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,720
delay it a bit?

578
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,280
I'll write them later.

579
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,800
Let me discuss something with you too.

580
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,520
Please.

581
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,520
About the notes,

582
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,920
you still need to submit now.

583
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,640
After all, Lan Jinghui's

584
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,600
personal improvement

585
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
is of utmost importance.

586
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,840
Mr. Zhang,

587
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,640
is it really not OK to improve slower?

588
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,560
What do you think?

589
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,800
Hello, Mr. Zhang,

590
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,480
Lan Jinghui,

591
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,040
you've dropped your notes.

592
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,160
I was wondering where they went.

593
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,560
Mr. Zhang, look,

594
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,680
here they are, right?

595
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,720
Well, Mr. Zhang,

596
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,240
if there's nothing else, we'll be going.

597
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,480
See you, sir.

598
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,160
Don't you think that by doing this

599
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,960
I'll be grateful to you.

600
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm telling you,

601
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,520
I know you just

602
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,160
want to see me screw up.

603
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,120
You don't have good intentions.

604
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,760
Just go back and make up the notes.

605
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,520
But you've already handed them in.

606
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,920
You said it yourself,

607
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,320
I don't have good intentions.

608
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,640
I knew it.

609
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,840
Done!

610
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,640
Peace out!

611
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,320
Wait.

612
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,840
You've missed too much.

613
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,880
Make up for those.

614
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,200
Come on, bro, just let me go.

615
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,920
Xia Qingtian, Xiao Xiaohua, Ma Yiming are

616
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,600
waiting for me to teach them instruments.

617
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,800
Watch your attitude.

618
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,760
Ling Dong,

619
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,680
I really didn't expect

620
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
you to become like this.

621
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,120
Why didn't I see through

622
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,480
your attitude towards me sooner?

623
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,400
I really didn't expect

624
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,240
you are someone like this.

625
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,720
You're really cruel!

626
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,080
So cruel!

627
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,280
You're so cruel!

628
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,800
What's wrong with him?

629
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,560
♪Beyond the long pavilion, by the ancient road,♪

630
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,240
♪grass dyes green the sky.♪

631

633
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,680
Let's do it again.

634
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,600
Mr. Ling, I'm done.

635
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,080
Good, all correct.

636
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,600
It's about time.

637
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,400
Let's call it a day.

638
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,680
Ling Dong, is it over?

639
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,480
Right.

640
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,360
This is the tutoring fee for this month.

641
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,320
Here, take it.

642
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,360
Thank you, auntie.

643
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,280
Xiong has been making

644
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,320
good progress lately.

645
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,120
Thank you.

646
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,240
No need to thank me.

647
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,760
Auntie, I'll be going then.

648
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Goodbye, Mr. Ling.

649
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
Goodbye, Xiong.

650
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,080
Son,

651
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,840
you don't have to do these.

652
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,800
Just focus on your studies.

653
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,040
It's OK, mom.

654
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,120
Here, be careful, it's hot.

655
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Watch out.

656
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,320
By the way, Mom,

657
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
here's the tutoring fee I've received.

658
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,240
We have enough for living expenses.

659
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,480
By the way,

660
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,520
I heard there's

661
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,920
a good English teacher

662
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,560
at Second High.

663
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,640
Should I hire her for you?

664
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,240
No, mom,

665
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,880
it's not necessary.

666
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,760
Just keep it.

667
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,240
I'm going to study.

668
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,320
The medicine is hot.

669
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,880
Cool it down a bit before taking it, mom.

670
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,840
Don't worry.

671
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,280
What's this?

672
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Raw eggs.

673
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,240
My dad says

674
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,320
eating raw eggs is good for the throat.

675
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,760
This is our Xia Family's

676
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,960
secret recipe.

677
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,560
Can I not eat it?

678
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,520
Nope.

679
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,240
How do you feel?

680
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,520
Xiaohua, don't throw it all up.

681
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,320
It's good for your throat!

682
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,040
Xiaohua!

683
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,440
Xiaohua!

684
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,560
Radish!

685
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Radish.

686
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,120
Eating radish clears the airways.

687
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,320
It's perfect for you.

688
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
Why would I eat radish?

689
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,160
You're not getting enough air, right?

690
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,040
Here, eat up.

691
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,240
Stop eating radish.

692
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,840
You're not a rabbit.

693
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,200
You're not going to make me

694
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
eat other weird stuff, are you?

695
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,480
My grandma said

696
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,640
eating garlic is especially effective

697
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,600
for someone whose voices

698
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,680
can't hit high notes.

699
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,560
If you can't handle the raw ones,

700
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,200
you can eat the pickled ones.

701
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,000
It's sweet,

702
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,960
and it tastes a bit better,

703
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,160
but it's not as effective as raw ones.

704
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,560
Look, I'm holding it in my mouth.

705
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,160
Very effective.

706
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,720
How's your throat, apprentice?

707
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,840
Would you like another piece?

708
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,480
No!

709
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,200
Please don't make me eat

710
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,280
anything else.

711
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,000
Stop tormenting me.

712
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,360
Or maybe I'll just go on stage

713
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
and recite a poem or something.

714
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,600
After all, our school

715
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,920
doesn't expect me to win anything.

716
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
I think that's a good idea, Jinghui.

717
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,680
Just let me go back to playing basketball.

718
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,520
No.

719
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,520
How can you say

720
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,400
something like this?

721
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,880
We can't just give up yet.

722
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,160
Our fellow students and staff

723
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,560
are waiting for us to bring glory!

724
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,800
Do they even count on us to bring glory?

725
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,160
Leave that to Ling Dong.

726
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,680
Forget about that brat!

727
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,920
[Attention all students!]

728
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,600
[Attention all students!]

729
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,040
We have an announcement.

730
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,760
[Congrats to Ling Dong from]

731
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
[Class 5, Grade 11 for winning the]

732
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
[first prize in the city physics contest.]

733
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,080
[Chen Luyang won the]

734
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,720
[second prize in the same contest.]

735
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,800
[They have brought honor to our school]

736
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,040
[and added to its prestige.]

737
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,320
[Let's give these two students]

738
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
[our warmest and]

739
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
[most sincere applause.]

740
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,440
[Bless them.]

741
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
Nice work, Ling Dong.

742
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,000
Lan Jinghui, where are you going?

743
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,640
We have found out

744
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,560
after how many collisions

745
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
the particle's rebound height

746
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,360
is less than 0.01 meters.

747
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,400
Let's look at the last problem.

748
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,720
Ling...

749
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,840
It's Ling Dong.

750
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,520
Ling Dong.

751
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,680
In our competition class,

752
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,880
you were the only one who solved it.

753
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,880
Why don't you

754
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,800
tell us all about

755
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,960
your thought process.

756
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,720
Yeah, yeah.

757
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,320
A lot of us

758
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,720
failed to solve the last problem.

759
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,640
Come on, tell us.

760
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,480
Ling Dong, share with us.

761
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,240
Come on.

762
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,040
Just tell us.

763
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,160
Sir, I also got it right.

764
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,520
[We now interrupt with breaking news.]

765
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,080
[Ling Dong from Class 5, Grade 11]

766
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,280
[will represent Chenjun High School]

767
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,320
[once again in competition.]

768
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,280
[He will be participating]

769
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,320
[in the city talent competition.]

770
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,480
Who's there?

771
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,480
Who was shouting on the rooftop?

772
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,360
It's dangerous, come down now!

773
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,440
Who was it?

774
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:45,920
Mr. Zhang,

775
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,200
regarding the registration

776
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,040
of the physics competition,

777
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,520
I'd like to ask you about the details.

778
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,680
OK, we'll talk later.

779
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,240
Sir,

780
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
it might be quite urgent

781
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,400
because the competition is close.

782
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,200
Well, then...

783
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,680
To my office.
