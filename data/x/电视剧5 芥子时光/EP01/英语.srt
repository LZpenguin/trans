You did great. I'll give you a thumbs up.

172
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,680
People, you can all leave now.

173
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Why did you stop running?

174
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,640
I can't run any further.

175
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,480
Here, take my bike!

176
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,960
I don't know how to ride.

177
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,400
Don't worry.

178
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,560
Piece of cake.

179
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,760
I'll show you, come here.

180
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,680
Here, give me your hand.

181
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,360
Come on, one foot here, the other there.

182
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,600
There you go.

183
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
Come on, pedal it!

184
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
My soy milk is going to spill!

185
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,640
Help!

186
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,080
See, I told you I can't ride a bike.

187
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,720
Are you alright?

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,440
You?

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,040
I'm fine.

190
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,520
If you can't ride, that's OK.

191
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll run with you.

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,800
Let's go.

193
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,040
Go!

194
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,360
Which class are you from?

195
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Class 5 of Grade 11.

196
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,360
Class 5 of Grade 11?

197
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,120
Yeah.

198
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
I think I'm also from that one.

199
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,560
I've just got transferred here.

200
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,240
You seemed to know the other guy.

201
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,160
Yeah,

202
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,640
right.

203
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,840
His name is Ling Dong.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
He's our school's top student.

205
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,280
That explains it.

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
He looks quite unpleasant.

207
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,800
What's your name?

208
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,360
I...

209
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,840
My name is Xiao Xiaohua.

210
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,080
I'm Lan Jinghui.

211
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,920
No, just wait a little longer.

212
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,840
Hey, miss.

213
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,600
Where's your uniform?

214
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,560
It's a matching set.

215
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,840
I was worried about being late,

216
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,520
so I didn't manage to put it on.

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
You two are late too, right?

218
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,920
I helped her over the wall to get in.

219
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,200
Isn't that cool?

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,640
Impressive!

221
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,960
Could you tell me

222
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,080
where Class 5 of Grade 11 is?

223
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,160
Class 5 of Grade 11?

224
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah.

225
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,920
I'm also from Class 5 of Grade 11.

226
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,040
You too?

227
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,320
We both are.

228
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,240
Let me take that for you.

229
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,680
Thanks.

230
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,320
No problem.

231
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,800
Be careful.

232
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,360
It's fine, it's fine.

233
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,760
Let's go.

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,280
Turn left. It's the second classroom.

235
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,640
Alright.

236
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,520
I'll leave it here.

237
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,080
Yo! Jinghui!

238
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
Ma Yiming!

239
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,120
Thanks.

240
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,920
[I've missed you.]

241
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,840
Me too.

242
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,760
Here, take a seat.

243
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,880
Why didn't you walk me in?

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,840
Morning, guys.

245
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,480
Morning, teacher.

246
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,080
Everyone, stand up.

247
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,240
Good morning, teacher.

248
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,360
Please, have a seat.

249
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,920
Xiao Xiaohua, you...

250
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,120
sit

251
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,080
over there.

252
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,520
OK, thank you, ma'am.

253
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,680
Go on.

254
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,920
Lan Jinghui.

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,520
Yes, teacher...

256
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000
Isn't it too cramped over there?

257
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,880
Indeed.

258
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,000
You sit over there,

259
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
next to Ling Dong.

260
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,520
For being late and climbing the wall,

261
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,720
you owe me a 2000-word report.

262
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,360
Make sure to submit it on time.

263
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,920
[Aye, aye, teacher!]

264
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,160
Alright.

265
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Now, I'd like to

266
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,760
properly introduce myself.

267
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,080
My name is Fang Hai.

268
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,080
I'm your new class advisor

269
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
for this term.

270
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,320
In the next

271
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,120
two years,

272
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
I have only one goal.

273
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,640
To help you all perform your best

274
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,760
in the college entrance exams.

275
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
I've also placed

276
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,080
a suggestion box in our class,

277
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,640
right over there.

278
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,080
If you have

279
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,600
any feedback for me

280
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,720
or about the class,

281
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,560
feel free to drop it in.

282
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,280
But I won't be reading them.

283
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,080
Furthermore, I hope everyone

284
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,720
will bring a potted plant

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,320
that you like

286
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
to school tomorrow.

287
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,680
OK.

288
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,200
This term's class rep

289
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,920
will be Xu Mengyu.

290
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,160
No objections, right?

291
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,680
Ma'am.

292
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,040
Xu Mengyu is on leave.

293
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,080
Right.

294
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
So...

295
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,320
Ma'am, I'll take over.

296
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
My name is Chen Luyang.

297
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,760
As last term's deputy class rep and

298
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,680
the vice-chairman of the Student Union,

299
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm confident I can fulfill

300
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,960
the duties of class rep.

301
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,560
Fine, it's yours then.

302
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,800
Great, where's the applause?

303
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,360
That's enough.

304
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,680
A new term, a new start.

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,520
I've

306
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,200
also brought

307
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
a little surprise for everyone.

308
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,440
Are you excited?

309
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,280
Yes!

310
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,440
A pop quiz.

311
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Brilliant!

312
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,200
[Only Ling Dong]

313
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
[was my rival before.]

314
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
[Now, another one?]

315
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,280
I want to have a word with you.

316
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,520
I'm speaking to you.

317
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,800
Did you hear me?

318
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,640
Hey, I'm talking!

319
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,320
I've noticed that

320
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,800
you're not only inconsiderate

321
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,120
but also incredibly selfish, you know?

322
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,840
We're all classmates.

323
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,440
Why couldn't you stay this morning

324
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,480
to give a statement together?

325
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,640
Allow me to get three things straight.

326
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,560
Firstly,

327
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,840
I didn't even know

328
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,520
we are classmates this morning.

329
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,960
Secondly,

330
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,880
there are cameras across the sidewalk

331
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,600
that recorded everything,

332
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,360
which can serve as evidence.

333
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,600
Thirdly,

334
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,520
I really don't need to bother with you.

335
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,480
Alright,

336
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,680
even if...

337
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,160
even if what you said is correct,

338
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,480
it's still a classic case of

339
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
being a Monday morning quarterback.

340
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,520
Isn't that right?

341
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,000
It's just hindsight.

342
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,920
Am I right?

343
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm speaking to you.

344
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,840
What?

345
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,200
Want to join me in there?

346
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,000
Shut up!

347
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,120
Xiaohua, Xiaohua,

348
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,400
where's our breakfast?

349
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,520
Right here.

350
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,400
Qi, here's your rice ball,

351
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,520
and Na, here are your three egg rolls.

352
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,960
It's all gone cold.

353
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,640
Why are there only egg rolls?

354
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,800
Where's my fried dough stick?

355
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,680
Sorry,

356
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,800
I ran into some trouble

357
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,640
on my way here.

358
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,640
Tomorrow,

359
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,320
I promise I'll bring everything,

360
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,800
nice and hot.

361
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,640
Alright then.

362
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,440
Xiaohua, just remember,

363
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
don't forget about us just because

364
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,680
we're in different classes now.

365
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,200
Yeah.

366
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,840
Is this Li Mingjiang's soy milk?

367
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,240
I'll take it to him.

368
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,280
What's all the excitement about?

369
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,360
Talking about breakfast?

370
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,640
Both of you, listen carefully.

371
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,440
From now on,

372
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,200
in this school,

373
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
as of 9:15:45 am,

374
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,560
she won't be

375
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,880
bringing breakfast for anyone else,

376
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
except for me,

377
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,040
Lan Jinghui.

378
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,920
Do you know why?

379
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,160
Because I'm her master,

380
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,200
and she's my apprentice.

381
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,520
Lan Jinghui,

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,080
what are you doing?

383
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
They're all

384
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,440
my former classmates.

385
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,560
Plus,

386
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,160
since when did I become your apprentice?

387
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,440
Didn't I just teach you

388
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,360
how to ride a bike this morning?

389
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,880
Classmates, good friends,

390
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,200
should help each other, right?

391
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Besides,

392
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,800
isn't it natural for an apprentice

393
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,880
to help her master?

394
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,280
You're going to write that report for me.

395
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,600
But,

396
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,320
you ended up eating the breakfast...

397
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Got a perfect score? Out of my face.

398
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,760
Wholesale?

399
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,480
Why don't you set up a stall?

400
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,800
Nice taste!

401
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,840
I love reading this, you know?

402
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,920
Don't touch my stuff.

403
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I'll touch it, so what?

404
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,360
I'll...

405
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,200
I didn't mean to...

406
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,800
I'll make it up to you.

407
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,160
It was an accident. I swear.

408
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,720
Ms. Fang,

409
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I won't sit next to

410
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,000
Lan Jinghui anymore.

411
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,960
He's seriously disrupting

412
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
my life and my studies.

413
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,160
I won't

414
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,120
repeat myself.

415
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,080
Just sit down. We're about to start.

416
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
Just sit down.

417
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
I'll definitely compensate you.

418
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,480
It was an accident.

419
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,680
Alright, class is starting.

420
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,480
Stand up!

421
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,600
Good morning, teacher.

422
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,800
Good morning, everyone, please be seated.

423
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,840
[We're going to learn about probability.]

424
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,800
[What is probability?]

425
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,280
Firstly,

426
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,560
the probability of random events

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,840
can be divided into two types:

428
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,800
random events and certain events.

429
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,280
Certain events mean

430
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,200
under condition S,

431
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
[events that will definitely happen]

432
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,080
are called...

433
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,160
Are you awake now?

434
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,960
Stay focus, alright?

435
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,920
[That is, events that will definitely]

436
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,120
[happen under condition S]

437
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
[are called certain events]

438
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,000
[relative to condition S.]

439
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,080
[So, events that will definitely not]

440
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,840
[happen are...]

441
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,560
Why didn't you alert me, huh?

442
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
[...Impossible events.]

443
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,240
[Thirdly, events that may]

444
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,840
[or may not happen]

445
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
[are called random events]

446
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,760
[relative to condition S.]

447
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
So now, we are about

448
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,280
to run 800 meters.

449
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,680
What, you want more?

450
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,520
No, sir, it's enough.

451
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,040
The last three students to finish the run

452
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,760
will each run 1500 meters

453
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
next time.

454
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,720
Boys and girls, split up and warm up.

455
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,640
Girls, over here.

456
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,520
Let's switch, come here.

457
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
You're such a

458
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,480
small-minded person.

459
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,600
I tore your book,

460
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
but it wasn't intentional.

461
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,440
I didn't say I wouldn't compensate you.

462
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
Besides, we're all classmates.

463
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,440
Is the friendship between classmates

464
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,360
really that fragile?

465
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,400
There's no friendship between us.

466
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,680
But we're still desk mates.

467
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,960
You can't deny that.

468
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,360
Are you good at running?

469
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,640
I'm OK.

470
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,440
Good enough to handle you.

471
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,560
Let's make a bet then.

472
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,880
About the 800 meters run,

473
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,320
if you outrun me,

474
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,560
we'll continue to be desk mates,

475
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,720
and I'll forget about

476
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,520
the book you tore.

477
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,200
But if you lose,

478
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,480
we'll change seats.

479
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,720
Deal!

480
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,320
No problem.

481
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,840
Get ready!

482
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,320
Come on, guys!

483
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,320
Wow, you've really tried your best, huh?

484
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,640
Nice job, sport!

485
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Four meters, five meters.

486
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
I'll leave you behind, seriously.

487
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,760
I haven't even started yet.

488
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm faster than you even by walking.

489
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,080
Have you noticed?

490
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,800
Have you noticed?

491
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,120
Huh?

492
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,720
I'm gone, seriously.

493
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm going for real.

494
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,000
Keep it up!

495
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,120
Class rep, what's the matter?

496
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,360
Can't run anymore, huh?

497
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,760
Let me give you a boost.

498
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Don't you think my dance moves

499
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,400
are quite...

500
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,720
What did you...

501
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,800
Are you alright?

502
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,200
Sir, I finished first!

503
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Are you OK?

504
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,480
I finished first.

505
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,200
Where are you off to, Jinghui?

506
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,840
Sir,

507
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,560
sir, I need to talk to you.

508
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,840
I have something to discuss with you too.

509
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,000
In a bit,

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,080
your sponsor will arrive.

511
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
We need to meet with him.

512
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,360
OK, sir.

513
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,480
But I have another issue.

514
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,920
I don't want to

515
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,520
sit next to Lan Jinghui.

516
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,760
Why not?

517
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,720
Because...

518
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,280
No rush, take your time.

519
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,000
Because he...

520
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,280
Not only is he poor in his studies,

521
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,600
he's rude, doesn't follow rules,

522
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,800
and his behavior at school

523
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,480
is extremely bad.

524
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,840
Being deskmates with someone like him

525
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,080
will negatively affect my studies

526
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
and might even

527
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,880
impact my future participation in

528
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,000
various activities and competitions.

529
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,920
So, sir, I strongly suggest

530
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,440
you find me a new deskmate.

531
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,640
I really can't stand him anymore.

532
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,000
Ling Dong,

533
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,240
you're quite the character.

534
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,400
Complaining about me behind my back.

535
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,040
If you have an issue,

536
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,160
why can't you discuss it with me directly?

537
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,520
I have nothing to discuss with you.

538
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,840
Well, that's too bad

539
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
because I have things to discuss with you.

540
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,200
Sir,

541
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,280
I've heard that

542
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,080
Ling Dong is the

543
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,280
top student in our entire school, right?

544
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,400
I can't do without

545
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,040
such an excellent deskmate.

546
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,480
I need to progress together with him,

547
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,160
right?

548
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,720
I don't accept, sir.

549
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,480
Ling Dong,

550
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,960
you're really selfish.

551
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,640
Let me tell you, today...

552
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,840
Lan Jinghui!

553
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,040
Dad?

554
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:44,920
How can you

555
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,640
speak to him like that?

556
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,400
No, I...

557
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,920
Why can't I speak to him

558
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,520
like that?

559
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,640
Do you know who he is?

560
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,520
Who is he?

561
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,360
He is...

562
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,800
He's your uncle!

563
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,200
My uncle?

564
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,320
Wait...

565
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,480
When did I get

566
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,440
another uncle?

567
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,440
I also don't know when

568
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,080
I got such a nephew.

569
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,640
Don't you call me that!

570
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
I warn you, don't just...

571
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,320
Lan Jinghui,

572
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,400
behave yourself, will you?

573
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,440
It doesn't matter if you are

574
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,360
uncle and nephew.

575
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,880
Now that everyone's here,

576
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,440
let's just talk this through.

577
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,280
Alright.

578
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,200
Talk about what?

579
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,000
Ling Dong,

580
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,240
you're the benchmark

581
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,160
for academic excellence at our school.

582
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,560
I'd like to ask you a favor,

583
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,640
to help him with his studies.

584
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,920
Sir, what?

585
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,760
No way, sir.

586
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
Absolutely impossible!

587
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Even if you paid me millions of dollar,

588
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,760
I would never

589
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,960
study with this bookworm.

590
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,240
How can you speak to

591
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,200
your uncle like that?

592
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,080
No, Dad, I...

593
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,880
Just be quiet.

594
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,400
Get out.

595
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,360
Dad, I...

596
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,480
Out, now!

597
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,120
- Mom.
- Hi, honey.

598
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,680
Here, I'll take your backpack.

599
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,840
Dinner's ready; I've served it for you.

600
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,720
Just dig in.

601
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,440
I need to

602
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,880
go help Auntie Ma.

603
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,960
Mom, you really don't need to

604
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,080
work so hard.

605
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
Don't worry about these.

606
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,000
Your only task is to ace your studies,

607
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,440
and get into a good university.

608
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,640
It's all worth it for me, no matter what.

609
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,240
Your father would be

610
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,360
at peace too.

611
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh, mom,

612
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,360
today at school

613
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,000
I met someone

614
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,560
who said he knew Dad.

615
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,360
Oh, finish your dinner,

616
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
and start doing your homework.

617
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,840
High school is very demanding.

618
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,520
Mom's in a hurry,

619
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,200
I have to go now.

620
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,240
Just eat.

621
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,040
Be careful, mom.

622
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,440
Ling Dong!

623
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,320
stop right there, Ling Dong!

624
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,040
What did my dad want with you yesterday?

625
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,680
It doesn't concern you.

626
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,760
Doesn't concern me?

627
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,960
That's my dad.

628
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,560
And I'm your uncle.

629
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,840
Stop right there.

630
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm warning you,

631
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,280
we're just

632
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,160
classmates.

633
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
If you keep claiming to be my...

634
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,320
My...

635
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,800
Uncle.

636
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,520
Shut up.

637
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,400
We are not related.

638
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,560
If you mention it again,

639
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,880
I'll...

640
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
What a punk?

641
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,520
Ling Dong,

642
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,040
er...

643
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,600
I, I, I want to...

644
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,760
What?

645
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,640
You...

646
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,040
You didn't bring a plant?

647
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,480
I failed again.

648
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,840
Such a great opportunity,

649
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,760
and you missed it.

650
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,480
What should I do?

651
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
I get nervous as soon as I see him.

652
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,160
This is that letter?

653
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
It's nice..

654
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,240
Be careful with it,

655
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,720
don't ruin the flower on it.

656
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,240
I think

657
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,760
you should go ahead

658
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,000
and hand it over to him.

659
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,680
But I'm not

660
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
mentally prepared yet.

661
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,800
Maybe tomorrow.

662
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,200
No, that won't do.

663
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,560
You've been waiting from last semester

664
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
all the way to this one.

665
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,760
I'll take care of this.

666
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,920
Qingtian,

667
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,760
you...

668
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Don't do anything rash.

669
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,760
Thanks.

670
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,080
Do you believe in me?

671
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,040
Yes I do.

672
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,680
Go for it. I'll definitely vote for you.

673
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:02,920
Qingtian.

674
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,440
What?

675
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,280
Regarding the election,

676
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,200
you will vote for me, right?

677
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,800
Sure thing...

678
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,840
Yo, Jinghui, let's shoot some hoops!

679
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,560
Let's go!

680
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
One minute.

681
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,880
What's this?

682
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,680
A friendship letter.

683
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,920
You? Get these?

684
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,200
Is it that shocking?

685
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,320
For me to receive this kind of letter,

686
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,840
isn't it expected?

687
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,240
Back at my previous school,

688
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,000
I used to get these letters

689
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,560
by the bagful.

690
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,600
Look at this!

691
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,640
I got here for only two days.

692
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,800
What, it's from you two?

693
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,800
No.

694
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,560
No way!

695
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,160
What does it have to do with us?

696
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,400
Hey, take a look for me.

697
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,800
What plant is this?

698
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,040
What's the meaning

699
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,960
behind this flower?

700
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,080
Help me. Take a look.

701
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
If I roll a dice,

702
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,160
what's the probability of

703
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,800
getting a number less than three?

704
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,200
I'd like to ask you guys.

705
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,600
Who can tell me

706
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,800
what are the numbers

707
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,080
less than three from one to six?

708
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,360
Chen Luyang.

709
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,120
One and two.

710
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,200
Correct.

711
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,160
So, what's the probability

712
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,720
of getting a one?

713
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,040
One-third,

714
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,000
no, one-sixth.

715
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,480
Right.

716
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,640
We can tell me the probability

717
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,200
of getting a two?

718
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Anyone?

719
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,560
Also one-sixth.

720
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,320
You're going to write that report for me.

721
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,680
Xiaohua,

722
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,640
how do you know someone like him?

723
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,560
Someone like him?

724
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,600
What's wrong with him?

725
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,280
You don't know

726
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,240
about his past, do you?

727
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,360
At his previous school,

728
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,880
he was known as the Demon.

729
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,560
What?

730
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,360
Just because some guys

731
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,960
glanced at him in the restroom.

732
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,400
Just a glance,

733
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,680
Lan Jinghui trapped them

734
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,000
in an alley.

735
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,880
Was it a rainy day

736
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,400
or a foggy day?

737
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
Details don't matter.

738
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,640
Just make sure you never

739
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,920
make direct eye contact with him.
