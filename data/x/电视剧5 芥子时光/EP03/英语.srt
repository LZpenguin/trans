00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,000
to play,

180
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,600
not to clean.

181
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Sorry,

182
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,880
our team's full.

183
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,240
And

184
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,400
we don't take

185
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,120
just anyone.

186
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,320
Look at me.

187
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,400
One-on-one!

188
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,720
Next!

189
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,120
Nice shot!

190
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,600
Jia Letian, come here!

191
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,280
It's training!

192
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Let these guys

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400
keep cleaning the balls.

194
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,720
Listen, you'll pay for this.

195
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,960
Beating me doesn't matter.

196
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
Joining the team

197
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
is up to our captain.

198
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,320
With your skills,

199
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,920
I doubt

200
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,720
your captain's any good.

201
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,760
What?

202
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,320
Bi Peng.

203
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
Who's looking for me?

204
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,960
Are you the captain?

205
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
Are you challenging me?

206
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,920
Or you can just admit defeat

207
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,200
and let me join the team.

208
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,800
Interesting.

209
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,000
Fine,

210
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,720
I'll give you three chances.

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,400
If you can score one point

212
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,240
on me,

213
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,080
you can join the team.

214
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Don't say we're bullying the newbies.

215
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,440
Fine, after joining the team,

216
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
I must have the rights I deserve.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,480
We're not here to clean balls.

218
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,520
Beat me first, then we'll talk.

219
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,040
Hey,

220
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,760
what's going on?

221
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,960
Spider-Man from Class 5

222
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,440
and Bi Peng from Class 8 are fighting.

223
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,320
Fighting?

224
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
Yeah, I'm going to check it out.

225
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,800
Nice, you've got some guts.

226
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,280
Let's do this.

227
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,280
Jinghui!

228
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,440
Calm down.

229
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Don't you want to see

230
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
if he can beat Bi Peng?

231
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,720
What's the trick?

232
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,760
- Ms. Fang?
- What's going on?

233
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,520
They had a bit of an argument

234
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,840
and decided to have a one-on-one.

235
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:26,840
A one-on-one?

236
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.

237
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,320
Basketball?

238
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,320
Yes.

239
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,000
Are you done?

240
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,280
Safety first.

241
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Don't cry

242
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,960
if you fall.

243
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,680
I suggest you tie it.

244
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,400
Nice shot!

245
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,720
You...

246
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,520
What? I won.

247
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,200
I didn't say start.

248
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,840
You didn't say not to start either.

249
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
Hello, Ms. Fang, Mr. Zhao.

250
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,360
When did you get here?

251
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,200
Letian,

252
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,840
be here on time for training tomorrow.

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,200
Let's go.

254
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,520
Okay.

255
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,160
Wait!

256
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,000
That doesn't count.

257
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,400
We should do it again.

258
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm tired.

259
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go.

260
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,920
Watch out!

261
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,280
Are you okay?

262
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
What's your problem, Bi Peng?

263
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,520
Is basketball your way to vent?

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
Come here and apologize!

265
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Apologize!

266
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,680
All right, everyone.

267
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
Back to class.

268
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,240
Nothing to see here.

269
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,400
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,400
I didn't mean to.

271
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,480
It's okay, I understand.

272
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,880
Just be careful when playing basketball.

273
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,200
Don't hurt anyone.

274
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,320
How many times have I told you

275
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,800
to change your bad temper!

276
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,240
It's okay.

277
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,920
He didn't mean to.

278
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,480
Thank you.

279
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,400
Is that the apology?

280
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,880
Since it can play

281
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,760
such a big role,

282
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,440
what is the use of the police?

283
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
You two, stop it!

284
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,880
Go back.

285
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,360
Ms. Fang, I forgot my uniform.

286
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,520
Go get it.

287
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,880
Let's go.

288
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,840
Ling Dong.

289
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,200
What's up?

290
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,120
Um...

291
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
I noticed you didn't bring any plants.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,080
I have extra at home,

293
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,440
so I brought some...

294
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't need it.

295
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,360
Thank you.

296
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,640
Good morning, apprentice.

297
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,600
Morning.

298
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,480
Morning, Jinghui.

299
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,440
Morning.

300
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,480
What are you doing?

301
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,880
Loosening the soil.

302
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,440
Lan Jinghui,

303
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,680
you used tricks

304
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,200
to beat me yesterday.

305
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,920
Let's go again today!

306
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm busy.

307
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,840
Can't you see I'm loosening the soil?

308
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,680
What do you mean,

309
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,840
you look down on me?

310
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,520
Ma Yiming, apprentice,

311
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,080
you all saw it.

312
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,720
He made the first move,

313
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,480
not me.

314
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,960
I told you,

315
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,440
green plants are dangerous.

316
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,440
Quicker, veterans!

317
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,880
Show some veteran spirit!

318
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,640
Ma Yiming,

319
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,920
keep up!

320
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,880
Well done, Lan Jinghui.

321
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,480
Excellent.

322
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,200
Faster, faster!

323
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,720
Great!

324
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,600
Faster!

325
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Faster!

326
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,640
Pause!

327
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,720
How do you like

328
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,240
my six-word title?

329
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,440
It's decent.

330
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,680
Bi Peng's hand

331
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,680
is bigger than mine, right?

332
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,480
How many thorns did he stick in?

333
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,080
Why do you care?

334
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
Don't you think my cactus

335
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,240
isn't getting enough sun?

336
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,960
You might be right.

337
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,000
Hang it up?

338
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,800
Good idea.

339
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,600
It just feels a bit lacking.

340
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,360
Outside?

341
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:31,920
Perfect.

342
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
There.

343
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Lan Jinghui

344
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,200
did the right thing.

345
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,280
Ma Yiming, you did well too.

346
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,680
These plants

347
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,840
really don't get enough

348
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,040
sunlight inside.

349
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,400
All right, listen up,

350
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
let's move

351
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
these plants outside.

352
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,720
We just reviewed the probability

353
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,920
formula for classical models.

354
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
So, the probability of A is the number

355
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,280
of basic events in A

356
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,720
divided by

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,880
the total number of basic events.

358
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,240
For example,

359
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,520
if we're rolling

360
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,520
two dice simultaneously,

361
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,480
the result

362
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
of the second die

363
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,560
could be...

364
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,800
Give it to me.

365
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,880
I wasn't playing.

366
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,800
It's in the desk.

367
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
Anyone else in class with a phone?

368
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,680
Take it out now.

369
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,240
Anyone?

370
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,200
Just him?

371
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,840
Lan Jinghui,

372
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,480
how about you?

373
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,160
I wasn't.

374
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,040
Then how did you

375
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,160
message Ma Yiming?

376
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,680
Bring it out.

377
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
Don't make me force you to.

378
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,040
Anymore?

379
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,720
None.

380
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:23,960
None?

381
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Good.

382
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,120
Hello, Xiaoai.
[*Intelligent voice assistant like Siri]

383
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm here.

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,520
It's here.

385
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,720
It really is here.

386
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,160
Jovi.
[*Intelligent voice assistant like Siri]

387
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,120
I'm here.

388
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,600
It's here.

389
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,640
Anymore?

390
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,080
Is this funny?

391
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,480
Funny or not!

392
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,440
Not funny,

393
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,600
not funny.

394
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:10,920
Both of you,

395
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
call your parents,

396
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,160
or forget about your phones.

397
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,640
Let's continue the class!

398
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,400
Back to where we left off...

399
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,360
What's so funny?

400
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,360
Where's your phone?

401
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,760
I don't use a phone.

402
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,360
Excuse me?

403
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,360
Are you from ancient times?

404
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,600
That's all

405
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,400
for today's class.

406
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,040
Do you remember

407
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,920
what I just taught?

408
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,120
Yes.

409
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,160
Alright, class over.

410
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,880
Stand up.

411
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Goodbye, teacher.

412
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,840
Goodbye.

413
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,040
So many phones.

414
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,200
Impressive.

415
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,360
He has everything.

416
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,240
There's more?

417
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,720
[Sent Ling Dong to my office.]

418
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,960
Ms. Fang wants you

419
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,280
in the office.

420
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,600
[Got it, Ms. Fang.]

421
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,760
How did you know

422
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,320
that?

423
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,720
[You too,]

424
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,920
[and remember to bring your phone.]

425
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,680
You're here.

426
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah.

427
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,560
Put your phones in the pouch.

428
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,160
Ling Dong,

429
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,480
we have two spots

430
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,600
for the city-wide physics competition.

431
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,640
Mr. Guo recommended you.

432
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,640
If you're interested,

433
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,080
fill out this registration

434
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,360
form.

435
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,360
Do I

436
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,920
need to attend every day?

437
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,080
No,

438
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,000
only on Mondays and Thursdays.

439
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:42,840
Any issues

440
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,840
with the schedule?

441
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,600
No.

442
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,760
Lan Jinghui.

443
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,640
Here.

444
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,520
Your 3,000-character self-critique?

445
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,760
It's in the classroom.

446
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,920
Go back to find it now,

447
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
or write a new one here.

448
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,960
If you can't finish,

449
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,360
stay with me for overtime tonight.

450
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,400
Goodbye, ma'am.

451
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,400
Hello?

452
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,160
Mom,

453
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,640
I might

454
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,280
be home late today.

455
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,080
If you get home first,

456
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,920
wait for me

457
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,720
to cook.

458
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,520
I know, okay.

459
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,920
Thought you didn't use a phone?

460
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,840
I mean... I find you

461
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,920
talk nonsense effortlessly.

462
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,000
Aren't you afraid I'll report you?

463
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,760
Well, in that case, I can't promise

464
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,880
to keep your secrets,

465
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,520
big nephew...

466
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,120
Shh!

467
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm telling you,

468
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,480
don't tell anyone.

469
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,680
Keep it hidden.

470
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Don't let anyone catch you.

471
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,240
Don't let anyone find out!

472
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,240
Keep it hidden!

473
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
- Hi, Xiaohua.
- Xiaohua.

474
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,560
Don't forget

475
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,600
what you promised us, okay?

476
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,560
Please.

477
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,520
Thank you.

478
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,360
We're off now,

479
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,800
bye.

480
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,520
Bye.

481
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,000
That octopus ball place is so good.

482
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll take you there now.

483
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,840
Lan Jinghui,

484
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,920
why are you still here?

485
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,840
I haven't finished my self-critique.

486
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
Once I finish, I'll leave.

487
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,400
Why haven't you left?

488
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm cleaning up.

489
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,480
If my memory serves me,

490
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,920
Liu Shu should have done this.

491
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,120
They had something urgent and left.

492
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,240
Didn't I just teach you

493
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,080
to learn to say no?

494
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,840
You've let

495
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,920
me down.

496
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,600
Come on, I'll clean for you.

497
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,400
No, you still

498
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,920
have your self-critique to write.

499
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,080
See, I've learned to say no.

500
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,560
What...

501
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,640
That's not...

502
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,680
how you use it.

503
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,960
Done.

504
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,080
You're still sweeping?

505
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,080
I'll do it for you.

506
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,320
It's okay.

507
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,200
Almost done.

508
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,520
Leave it to me.

509
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,240
It's okay,

510
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,720
I'll do it myself.

511
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,240
Then...

512
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,360
let me take out the trash for you.

513
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,560
Is that all right?

514
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,360
Okay.

515
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm leaving.

516
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,080
See you tomorrow.

517
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,160
See you.

518
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,200
Bye.

519
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,920
Bye.

520
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,440
Who? Who did this?

521
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,600
Don't think I don't know.

522
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,760
Who did this?

523
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,520
I'm talking to you!

524
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,120
Lan Jinghui led it.

525
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,280
Where is he?

526
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,600
I don't know.

527
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,680
Get your monitor here.

528
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,680
I am the monitor.

529
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,360
You're in trouble, you know?

530
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,840
Now, I need you to

531
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,880
take some students

532
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,720
to clean up downstairs.

533
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,120
Okay.

534
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,640
Wait.

535
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,160
Take down the flower shelf.

536
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,320
Director.

537
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,480
To my office.

538
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,240
Fang Hai,

539
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,520
you've been at this school

540
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,440
for quite a while now,

541
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,440
and safety

542
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,160
is our top priority here.

543
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,840
What if something had happened?

544
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,400
I was just thinking about starting

545
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,680
the new semester with a fresh outlook.

546
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,720
I asked the students

547
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,600
to bring their favorite plants

548
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,560
to school to nurture them.

549
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,200
I thought

550
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,120
it would lift their spirits

551
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,240
each day.

552
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,160
Before doing this,

553
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I had already

554
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,960
planned

555
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,360
everything meticulously

556
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,720
and even bought the plant stand.

557
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,920
I fear something would go wrong.

558
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
I never imagined it could fall

559
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,680
in the middle of the night.

560
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,920
Spare me the excuses.

561
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,680
Young teachers with new ideas,

562
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,720
I support and commend that.

563
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,120
But if you're going to have plants,

564
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,840
safety measures must be taken.

565
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Can you handle the responsibility

566
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,240
if a pot falls

567
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,120
and injures someone?

568
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,440
Understood, Mr. Zhang.

569
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,600
I didn't consider everything properly.

570
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,000
Please rest assured,

571
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,880
I will handle the aftermath.

572
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,600
Students' task is to study.

573
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Spare the unrelated matters.

574
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,600
Remove it immediately.

575
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,040
What are you doing here?

576
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,200
[It has nothing to do]

577
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,000
[with Ms. Fang.]

578
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,520
I should be

579
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,600
the person who takes

580
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:27,960
responsibility.

581
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I moved the flower stand

582
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,560
outside.

583
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,680
But, if we step back,

584
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,720
the stand itself

585
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,960
has no issues

586
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,520
with its weight capacity.

587
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,720
If it fell,

588
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,000
it was

589
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,640
deliberate damage.

590
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,960
You can go check.

591
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,720
The cracks on top are all new.

592
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,840
Someone deliberately caused this?

593
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,360
Exactly.

594
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:47,840
Who?

595
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,640
I don't know.

596
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,160
You have one day

597
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,200
to find out the person.

598
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,600
If failed,

599
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,080
all of

600
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,200
your commendations

601
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,360
and extracurricular activities for

602
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,200
your class would be canceled.

603
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,440
You...

604
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,480
You didn't bring a plant?

605
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,920
I failed again.

606
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,000
Apprentice,

607
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,560
where's my breakfast?

608
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,320
Why do you

609
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,440
walk so quietly?

610
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,520
And

611
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,240
why do you keep calling me that?

612
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,840
You haven't taught me anything.

613
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,160
Just this?

614
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,400
Give it back, then.

615
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,080
It's all right.

616
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,560
A token from my apprentice,

617
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
how can I refuse?

618
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,400
I'll manage.

619
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,960
Be careful, it's mine.

620
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,000
What is this?

621
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,920
Narcissus,

622
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,120
isn't it obvious?

623
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,560
Narcissus?

624
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
It looks more like

625
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
sprouted garlic to me.

626
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,720
It's Narcissus,

627
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,320
just

628
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,160
growing in soil.

629
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,880
Jinghui,

630
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
we're asked to bring plants over.

631
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,160
Why did you bring garlic?

632
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,120
Saving it for lunch?

633
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,200
You know,

634
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,400
sprouted garlic

635
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,320
is spicy.

636
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,800
Brought the wrong one.

637
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,280
Well...

638
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,720
just give it to me for lunch.

639
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,560
Let's share.

640
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,960
I don't eat garlic.

641
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,280
That's like losing half the flavor.

642
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,040
Too spicy.

643
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,240
Didn't grandma say

644
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
this is potted Narcissus?
