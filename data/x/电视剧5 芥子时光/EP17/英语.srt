Ling Dong,

4
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,280
I stumbled upon this awesome book

5
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
called "Border Town",

6
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
and it's a special edition.

7
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,240
Want it? I'll buy you a copy.

8
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,360
Just read it when you...

9
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,680
I'll check it out later.

Seriously?

12

Take it.

13
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,200
Keep it for yourself.

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,120
You gotta do

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,360
some basic drills.

16
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,160

Basic drills, huh?

18
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,040
Looks like we have

19
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,320
different definitions of "thick".

20
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,160

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,800
No...

354
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
No connection.

355
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,320
But it's New Year's Eve.

356
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
You should enjoy it.

357
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,640
Studying's quite enjoyable.

358
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,440
Fine.

359
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,120
What I'm talking about

360
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,880
is spending time with you guys,

361
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,520
not these test papers.

362
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,280
What?

363
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,280
We had a deal.

364
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,520
But mom...

365
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,760
Mom.

366
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,400
Why the long face?

367
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,600
My mom wants me to go home.

368
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
What? Why?

369
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,960
You talked with her about this, right?

370
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,320
Yeah.

371
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,440
Who knew she'd change her mind

372
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,440
and insist I go home for dinner?

373
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,000
My mom also messaged me

374
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,840
to come home.

375
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,880
What...

376
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,040
Don't look at me like this.

377
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,000
You should go home.

378
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
But

379
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,880
what about you?

380
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,720
What

381
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,240
"what about me"?

382
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,680
Don't worry about me.

383
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:44,960
Why are you

384
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,120
worrying about me?

385
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,440
I've been through it all.

386
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,000
Right?

387
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,480
And I'm used to

388
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,480
spending New Year's

389
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,280
alone.

390
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,320
Besides,

391
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
my grandma and dad

392
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,360
have left me plenty to eat,

393
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,680
food's not an issue.

394
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,640
And I've got games

395
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,880
to keep me busy.

396
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,240
Right?

397
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,520
[Don't worry]

398
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
[about me.]

399
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,960
Chill, I'm good.

400
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,040
Seriously.

401
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,720
Could you just stop staring at me?

402
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,080
Back to work, okay?

403
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,600
Finish it and go home.

404
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,160
Alright.

405
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,080
[Dumplings coming up!]

406
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
[No sneaky bites.]

407
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,080
[Eat light, Datu.]

408
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,040
[Mom, I'm hungry.]

409
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
[Alright, babe.]

410
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,680
[Just a sec.]

411
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,200
[Chop-chop.]

412
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,960
[Grab a snack.]

413
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
[Will be ready.]

414
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
[Just a minute.]

415
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,880
[Dumplings coming up!]

416
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,320
[Hurry.]

417
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
[Here come the dumplings!]

418
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,280
Here comes the fish!

419
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,000
Put it here.

420
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,640
May there be a surplus every year.

421
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,680
Thank you, my son.

422
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,080
It's nothing.

423
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,000
You're really blessed.

424
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
Alright, let's dig in!

425
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,720
Pour some drink for your Auntie.

426
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,160
Go ahead.

427
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,520
Okay.

428
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,440
Thanks.

429
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm so happy.

430
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,640
It's so kind of you.

431
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,280
Here.

432
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Alright.

433
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,560
Mom.

434
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,880
And pour some for me.

435
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,000
Happy New Year!

436
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,840
Happy New Year!

437
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,960
Starving.

438
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,880
Bring on the good stuff!

439
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,800
Hello?

440
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,200
[Jinghui?]

441
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,600
Hey, what's cooking?

442
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,400
Got anything good going on?

443
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,640
Granny.

444
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
Hot pot's on,

445
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,520
Ling Dong and Xiaohua

446
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
are beasts.

447
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
Gotta hurry,

448
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,480
meat's

449
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,560
almost ready

450
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,200
or

451
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
they'll take it all.

452
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Talk to you later!

453
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,640
Alright.

454
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,360
Make sure you fill up.

455
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,520
[Right.]

456
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,480
[Convey my greetings to them]

457
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,720
[and wish them a Happy New Year.]

458
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
I will. Granny, bye.

459
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,680
Happy New Year.

460
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,920
Happy New Year.

461
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,120
Look what we

462
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,000
brought for you!

463
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,680
Hey,

464
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,720
are you

465
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,120
tearing up?

466
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
Don't let those tears spill.

467
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,920
I'm not,

468
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,400
don't you worry about that.

469
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,160
Happy New Year.

470
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,800
[Xiaohua.]

471
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,680
[It's almost time for the first snow.]

472
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,720
[You've missed]

473
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,840
[so many chances before,]

474
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,600
[make sure you seize this one.]

475
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,480
Ling Dong.

476
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I wanna tell you something.

477
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,400
Heard that

478
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,840
the first snow is

479
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,280
perfect for...

480
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,760
for...

481
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,680
What is it?

482
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,160
I wanna say...

483
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Happy New Year!

484
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,160
Happy New Year!

485
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,280
Happy New Year!

486
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,560
Happy New Year!

487
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,360
Happy New Year!

488
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,480
Happy New Year!

489
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,800
Happy New Year!

490
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,280
[There aren't many beautiful things]

491
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,040
[in the world,]

492
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,400
[only tonight's fireworks]

493
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,080
[and the smile on your face.]

494
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,920
[Although I don't]

495
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,760
[have the courage to say it now,]

496
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,720
[I know]

497
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,160
[I'll never forget]

498
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,280
[this 17th New Year's Eve.]

499
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,720
Wow,

500
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
who's this handsome kid?

501
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm so jealous

502
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,880
of myself!

503
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,000
[Jinghui.]

504
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,720
[What are you doing?]

505
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,200
So vain.

506
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,040
Isn't this your friend's?

507
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,240
Forgot it on the table.

508
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,640
Yeah, it's my classmate Xiaohua's.

509
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,360
Make sure to

510
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
give it back tomorrow.

511
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,080
I will. Granny.

512
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
Have some fruit.

513
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Yeah.

514
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,560
[On the first day of school,]

515
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,240
[Ling Dong talked to me,]

516
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,040
[though]

517
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,400
[it was a bit awkward.]

518
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,160
I was there too.

519
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,200
Why didn't she draw me?

520
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,720
[It'd be nice if Ling Dong]

521
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,240
[knew what baby's breath stands for.]

522
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,200
Baby's breath?

523
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,280
Ling Dong.

524
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,200
The meaning of baby's breath flowers.

525
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
[I'll secretly]

526
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
[love you from the shadows.]

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,880
[All the stars in the sky]

528
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
