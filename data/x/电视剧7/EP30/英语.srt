00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP30

2
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,800
Thanks for the speech of the fourth debater of affirmative side.

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The contest has come to an end.

4
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,560
Now all judges leave the site

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,720
and discuss the result, please.

6
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,800
So,

7
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,960
we firstly raise hands

8
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,760
to vote.

9
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,200
To Team AFF, raise your hand.

10
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
To Team NEG?

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,120
How about you two?

12
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
I haven't decided yet.

13
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,480
They're equal.

14
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
Yes. I also feel they're

15
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
equal in strength.

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,000
The contest was very interesting.

17
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,800
Did you notice

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,600
when they got on the stage,

19
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,960
they changed their order of seats?

20
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Why did they do that?

21
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,600
I probably

22
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,640
knew what it meant

23
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,720
at the end of the contest.

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
I'm familiar with these two teams.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,760
Here's the thing.

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Team 235

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,320
was in the same team with Team AFF.

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,000
Their relations are complicated.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,640
The first debater of negative side

30
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,480
is the girlfriend of fourth debater

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,360
of affirmative side.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,680
According to the format, the fourth debater

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,840
should refute the first debater.

34
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,640
He was afraid

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,040
of his girlfriend and also wanted to win.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,920
So he changed seats with

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,360
the third debater

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,320
to refute the second debater.

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,600
The problem was thus avoided.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
Team NEG had wanted to adopt

41
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,760
Tian Ji's strategy for a horse racing,

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,160
sacrificing the weakest player.

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,800
Unexpectedly,

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,720
Team AFF did such a thing.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
So he had to also

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,920
exchange seats of the third and the fourth.

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,800
Which meant that

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,880
the strategy of horse racing

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,800
remained its advantage.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,040
That's how it goes.

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,400
Brilliant, brilliant!

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
But anyway,

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
from argument to refutation of Team AFF,

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,440
the only consensus Team NEG made

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,400
is the definition.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
They barely carried forward their argument.

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,480
My fellow debater,

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,120
what's the usage of illness?

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,800
From another perspective,

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,120
illness can enhance our resistance.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,040
My fellow debater,

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
what's the usage of looking for immortality?

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,480
From another perspective,

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,360
it's good for self-cultivation.

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,040
My fellow debater,

66
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,680
what's the usage of

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,400
staying at home,

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,080
doing nothing at all?

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,280
From another perspective,

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,200
it can get over negative emotion,

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
and relax our body and mind.

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
So, from another perspective,

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,960
are all useful things

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,840
also useless?

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,640
Useless things are useful,

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
and useful things are useless.

77
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Your opinion is that

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,400
you'll win anyway if you

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,200
change a perspective.

80
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,840
Actually, our resolution

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,280
is a universal judgment.

82
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Okay. Let's look at the next

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,360
question:

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,640
Is there any completely useless thing?

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,000
It's definitely a trap.

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,560
Even if it's a trap,

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
you have to jump into it.

88
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
Otherwise, you have to escape.

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,480
I think they could fight back.

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,640
Of course.

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,040
Many scientific charlatans study perpetual motion machine.

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,600
It's a useless thing to study it.

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,680
Studying perpetual motion machine

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
is a useless thing.

95
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,760
Is it completely useless?

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,360
See? You have to admit the opposite is right.

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,480
No.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
Everything has its value.

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,320
So useless thing is also useful.

100
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,520
Doesn't it illustrate

101
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,920
that

102
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,800
our argument is right?

103
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,800
So useless thing

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
does not exist at all, right?

105
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,840
Then what are we debating

106
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,440
about?

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,360
If your argument

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,840
stands,

109
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,560
the contest

110
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,640
shouldn't exist, right?

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,440
It exists.

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Uselessness of the useless thing

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,720
is in a secular context.

114
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,920
When we talk about whether it's useful,

115
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,240
we're judging its value.

116
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,920
Things defined in a secular context

117
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,600
are judged on their value,

118
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,840
but you're always changing perspectives.

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
Aren't you sticking to double standard?

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,160
Not bad.

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,560
Yeah.

122
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,960
Not good.

123
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,960
They only did half of the refutation and

124
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,880
reduction to absurdity.

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,800
She didn't pave the way

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,720
for the first debater.

127
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,800
In my opinion,

128
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,480
in this round,

129
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,080
she at least made audience think about

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,320
several definitions of usage.

131
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,960
So the purpose of this round

132
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,680
has been reached.

133
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,920
Task completed.

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,440
It seems we won this round.

135
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
But we didn't press forward.

136
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
The opponent responded too fast.

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,760
Even if we have time,

138
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,880
we may not press forward.

139
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,160
Let's depend on Dango.

140
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,760
Come on!

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Let's welcome

142
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,200
the first debater of negative side to state the opinion.

143
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Please.

144
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,800
Thank you, Chief Judge.

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,240
Hello, everyone.

146
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
If a thing is useless to me,

147
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
I'll call it a useless thing.

148
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,280
The fellow debater would say:

149
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,040
No.

150
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,280
It is useful

151
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,200
for my neighbor.

152
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
Isn't it called useful?

153
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,680
It's the same as follows:

154
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,560
Who told you dog food cannot be eaten?

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,400
Dogs eat it.

156
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
So dog food can be eaten.

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,560
I admit it

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,440
that humans can also eat dog food.

159
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,080
But we cannot regard it as our dinner,

160
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,760
my fellow debater.

161
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,760
Similarly,

162
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,160
from what perspective

163
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,760
can I enter a top university

164
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,520
by reading comic books

165
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
in a pleasant way?

166
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
From what perspective

167
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
am I guaranteed to

168
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,680
make a living by worshiping idols?

169
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,280
These useless things

170
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,760
can be useful if we change a perspective.

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,320
But is that the exact usage that we

172
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
really need?

173
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,800
Just like us.

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,760
We debate together,

175
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,040
eat together, hang out together,

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
study in the library together,

177
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
and work all night long together.

178
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,960
We have become best friends.

179
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,120
We have got

180
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
the best memories.

181
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,880
But which team is not like this?

182
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
Can friendship and memories

183
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,600
enable us to get

184
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,320
the trophy?

185
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,840
No.

186
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,440
You cannot win because of these

187
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,360
in any contest.

188
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,560
We have to put in abilities

189
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
and efforts to be the champion.

190
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,080
We're all ordinary people.

191
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,320
What we need is to go to a college,

192
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,360
make a living,

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
do things that are useful for us,

194
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,280
and be a useful person.

195
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Instead of saying

196
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,120
"the useless thing is the greatest usage"

197
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,880
written by Zhuangzi,

198
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,360
who finally lived a life

199
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,000
as his pipe dream.

200
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,760
Thank you.

201
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,280
Let's welcome

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
the fourth debater of affirmative side to refute.

203
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,440
The time limit is also two minutes.

204
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,360
Thank you, Chief Judge.

205
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,800
Hello, my fellow debater.

206
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,360
Hello.

207
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,320
Do you think

208
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,240
the standard of judgement

209
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,000
of usage in the resolution

210
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,080
cannot be different?

211
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,000
Of course no.

212
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,840
Otherwise, they would be

213
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,600
confused with each other.

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
As for your argument,

215
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,280
can I think like this?

216
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
Useless things

217
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,720
are useless,

218
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,200
so they are useless, right?

219
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,480
Well...

220
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,440
Circular argument.

221
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,320
No.

222
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,040
According to

223
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,480
your definition,

224
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,240
your argument is actually

225
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,320
a nonsense.

226
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,160
The key point of our argument is that

227
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,880
the usage of useless things is impractical.

228
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,000
Emphasizing their usage

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,640
is a behavior

230
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,160
to abandon practicality.

231
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
It will mislead many people's

232
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,600
value judgment and behaviors.

233
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,760
Give me an example.

234
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,720
For students who are about to take college entrance examination,

235
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,080
it's useless to read comic books every day.

236
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,000
It's very realistic.

237
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,640
The question

238
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,240
has been answered by us

239
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,960
at the beginning.

240
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,240
On the contrary, in your notion,

241
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,320
is there only one path for human life,

242
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,040
or is there only one object

243
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,880
in each period of life?

244
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
Is my fellow debater's

245
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,720
so-called practicality

246
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,360
packed with

247
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
narrower values?

248
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,240
Thank you.

249
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,320
We failed this one.

250
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,560
As is expected.

251
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,440
It doesn't matter.

252
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,520
Now it's the second round of speech.

253
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,200
The second debater of affirmative side speaks,

254
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
and the third debater of negative side refutes.

255
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,800
Anyhow, we wiped out

256
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,640
the opponents' battlefield.

257
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
We won't be entangled with definitions.

258
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,480
We'll see whose standard will win.

259
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,000
They really have a fierce debate.

260
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,920
Did you understand it?

261
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Almost. Almost.

262
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,320
Really?

263
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,320
Thank you, Chief Judge.

264
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,040
We just made a consensus.

265
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,520
Uselessness of the useless thing

266
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
refers to that

267
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
in a secular context.

268
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,040
It has no problem at all.

269
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,080
The problem is that

270
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,040
how we should

271
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,280
evaluate the usage of useless things.

272
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,760
We think,

273
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,520
the standard of evaluation

274
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,360
should be multi-dimensional.

275
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,720
In an avalanche,

276
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,200
no snowflake is inculpable.

277
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,760
At the moment when people succeed,

278
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,400
each book we read,

279
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,600
each song we listened to,

280
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
and each inch of land we walked by

281
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,840
are not useless.

282
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,560
Am I right?

283
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
When you use multi-dimensional standard

284
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,120
to evaluate the usage of useless things,

285
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,800
you'll find out that

286
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,720
they'll always blossom

287
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,400
into useful flowers

288
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
in the desert.

289
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
So, in our opinion,

290
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
useless things are useful.

291
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,200
Because this evaluation

292
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,120
is more comprehensive,

293
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,400
more objective, and more equal.

294
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,440
It won't lead us to

295
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,840
arrogance and ignorance

296
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
under the utilitarian value.

297
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,800
From the second round,

298
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,320
Team NEG tried to fight back.

299
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,680
Evaluation is multi-dimensional.

300
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
I think this point

301
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,680
has no problem.

302
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,840
It would be argued as extreme.

303
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,120
My fellow debater.

304
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
Is the sense of right and wrong a kind of

305
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,480
evaluation?

306
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Yes.

307
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,040
So is the evaluation of right and wrong

308
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,000
also multi-dimensional?

309
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Is the standard of right and wrong

310
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,360
not unique?

311
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,840
Kidnapping with morality.

312
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,400
You're right, my fellow debater.

313
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,400
The standard of right and wrong

314
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,440
isn't unique, of course.

315
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
The hound is good for hunters,

316
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
but bad for rabbits.

317
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,320
The feudal etiquette

318
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
was right in feudal society,

319
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,600
but is definitely wrong nowadays.

320
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,800
The sun looks white with naked eyes,

321
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,160
but looks black in the camera film.

322
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,760
The world is complicated in nature.

323
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,000
Evaluation standard is also multi-dimensional.

324
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,840
Any problem?

325
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,800
Don't be so aggressive!

326
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes. So a thing

327
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,120
is both rational

328
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,080
from our perspectives.

329
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,240
Does it belong to

330
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
multi-dimensional standard?

331
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,000
Of course.

332
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,560
So each of us argues

333
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
from our own perspective.

334
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,880
How do you judge by

335
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,840
such standard?

336
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,600
What problems can you solve

337
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,320
with it?

338
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
It's tricky.

339
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
If there's no kindness, there's no evil.

340
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
If there's no ugliness, there's no beauty.

341
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,440
Evaluation can be multi-dimensional,

342
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
but it doesn't mean that

343
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,880
we cannot

344
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,560
distinguish beauty from ugliness, right from wrong.

345
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
The evaluation of a thing

346
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,080
originates from its principal contradiction

347
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,920
and principal aspect.

348
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,400
That is the standard we need

349
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,360
to guide our life.

350
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,800
My fellow debater, am I right?

351
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,880
From the beginning till now,

352
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,720
the opponents

353
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
are only doing one thing:

354
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Giving useless things a value,

355
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
an unconvincing value.

356
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,960
If it's unconvincing, what value

357
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
cannot be found?

358
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,280
In 2016,

359
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,240
a young girl

360
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,080
was obsessed with online novels.

361
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,520
She starved to death in the staircase

362
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,600
with a phone in hand.

363
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,600
If we must find the usage

364
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
of online novels brought to her,

365
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,240
it probably made her

366
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,720
less painful

367
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,680
when she died.

368
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,800
This kind of usage

369
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
can lead us to

370
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,800
the emptiness of values.

371
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
What else?

372
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,160
We hope the opponents

373
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,800
do not forget

374
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,520
responsibilities as debaters.

375
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,720
Don't forget the most

376
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,000
valuable spirit in debating:

377
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,720
seeking for the truth.

378
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
A thing is as what

379
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,600
it should be.

380
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
If it's useless,

381
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,440
please admit that it's useless.

382
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,280
Thank you.

383
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
Thanks for the second debater's

384
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,800
splendid speech.

385
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,240
Let's welcome the third debater of affirmative side to refute.

386
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,960
Please.

387
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,960
Thank you, Chief Judge.

388
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,520
Hello, my fellow debater.

389
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,200
Hello.

390
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,680
You have been saying that our

391
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,280
definition is not right,

392
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
and criteria is not standard.

393
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
But you didn't give us

394
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
your process of argumentation.

395
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,440
Please give us an example

396
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,560
of uselessness

397
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,160
that you support.

398
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,800
So bold!

399
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,800
Why?

400
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,920
During refutation,

401
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,960
he completely hands in the opinion

402
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,000
to the opponent.

403
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,320
It means he's very confident.

404
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,640
If I were Hao,

405
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
I would delay the time

406
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
by not responding him,

407
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
so as to waste his refutation time.

408
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,680
Am I right?

409
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,760
My fellow debater,

410
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,400
that's why

411
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,920
you're sitting as an audience.

412
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,520
If you go home on vacation,

413
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,280
you make a very busy

414
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,920
study plan.

415
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,000
It's called a useless thing.

416
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,760
Making study plan on vacation

417
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,080
can help me to study on vacation.

418
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Isn't it useful?

419
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,000
But you won't execute

420
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,800
the plan at all.

421
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,640
That's true.

422
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,880
So you mean that

423
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,320
if I don't use it,

424
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,400
it won't be useful.

425
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,480
Aren't all skills

426
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,040
and knowledge

427
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,280
useless if I don't use them?

428
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Can you give me an example

429
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,000
that is useful even if

430
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,800
we don't use it?

431
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,680
Of course.

432
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,600
One filled with knowledge behaves with elegance.

433
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,840
It's useful even though we don't use it.

434
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
Filled with knowledge

435
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,640
is useful for behaving elegance.

436
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
Why is it called useless?

437
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,560
But it doesn't

438
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,360
make a direct effect.

439
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
So direct usage

440
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,200
is called usage.

441
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,160
Knowledge that is not

442
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,880
on the exam paper

443
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,600
is useless,

444
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,640
and we're just making useless efforts.

445
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,520
At least we should have a clear

446
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,000
cause and effect relation.

447
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,480
Right?

448
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,400
Otherwise it would come back to

449
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,240
the endless loop

450
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,280
where I make an example

451
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,440
and you change another perspective.

452
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,120
Do you continue to deny

453
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,200
the existence of useless things

454
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,520
and thus deny the resolution?

455
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,680
Yes.

456
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
We support the definition

457
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,560
of useless things in the resolution,

458
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
which is the useless thing

459
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,160
in the secular context.

460
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,600
We also explicitly assert

461
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
at the same time,

462
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,960
that completely useless things

463
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,880
don't exist.

464
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,000
It's also our

465
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,720
resistance and negation

466
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,920
against utilitarianism.

467
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,880
Because judging whether a thing

468
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,640
is useful or not with the standard

469
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,200
of utilitarianism

470
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
is itself

471
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,000
a prejudice and unfairness.

472
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,440
It's even a self-castration of

473
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
our choice of life.

474
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,960
Countless choices that are useful

475
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
but we think are not

476
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,240
are neglected, abandoned,

477
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,760
and buried

478
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
during useless judgment.

479
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,960
From this perspective,

480
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,960
we must deny

481
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,120
the existence of useless things.

482
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,640
In your opinion,

483
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,320
the useless thing today

484
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
may become useful tomorrow.

485
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,680
Nihility now

486
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,360
is more likely to be the foundation

487
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
for constructing the future.

488
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,960
The ancient Greek rhetoricians,

489
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,720
Owen in the eighteenth century,

490
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,880
and utopia of Saint-Simon.

491
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
They were all greeting

492
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,520
the next era

493
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,320
in the atmosphere

494
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,080
of uselessness.

495
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,440
So, all that seem useless

496
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
are testifying the short-sighted people.

497
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,120
We're inferior.

498
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,840
It's okay.

499
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,520
It's okay.

500
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,320
It's okay.

501
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,400
So fierce.

502
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,360
He really negated the resolution

503
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,280
on the definition.

504
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,240
More importantly, he made it reasonable.

505
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,640
If it continues, we have no way

506
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,440
to beat them.

507
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,960
The coach of Team NEG

508
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,640
applies for a tactical pause.

509
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
This period lasts for three minutes.

510
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,560
It allows two coaches to be involved,

511
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,120
and adjust the team member and

512
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
strategies according to

513
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,720
the result of the former contest.

514
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,400
Time begins.

515
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,800
Sorry. I made a mistake.

516
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,440
It's okay, Hao.

517
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,840
The argument did not collapse. We can beat them.

518
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,960
Nan Bei. Are you on or not?

519
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,800
See you on the stage.

520
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,880
Yes.

521
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,680
Replace me.

522
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,800
No.

523
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Replace me.

524
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,280
I cannot resist them anymore.

525
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,320
But my condition now...

526
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,200
Hao, listen to me.

527
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm good at argument

528
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,920
and refutation.

529
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,040
But for the free debating,

530
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,240
we really need you to be the leader.

531
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,520
You can control the situation.

532
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,280
I'm really not good at it.

533
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,760
Alright.

534
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,200
Listen to me.

535
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,080
Don't be panic.

536
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,600
Not until the last minute

537
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,120
can we know who's the winner.

538
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,200
Dango is right.

539
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,640
Nan Bei, you are the first.

540
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,440
You are in charge of rebuttal.

541
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
Others prepare for free debating.

542
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,400
Any questions?

543
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
No.

544
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,640
Good job in the former contest.

545
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,000
But it's not enough to use logic.

546
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
We should unfold

547
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,680
the second argument

548
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
even more in the next round.

549
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,040
I doubt they have

550
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,720
more arguments.

551
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,280
Don't let them elaborate.

552
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,000
Understand?

553
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,320
Coach. We have solutions.

554
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,240
I think we can beat them.

555
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,520
It depends on you to make decisions.

556
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,400
But remember.

557
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,960
Be responsible for your decisions.

558
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,120
At present,

559
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,800
we are a little bit inferior to them.

560
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
But consensus has been reached.

561
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,360
It doesn't matter during refutation.

562
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,360
What matters is that we should pull the opponents

563
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,120
into our own battlefield.

564
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,360
Rebutter

565
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,760
of opponent is either Liu Yanze

566
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,280
or Yin Nan.

567
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,120
So don't rush.

568
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,200
Remember to elaborate

569
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,360
our own arguments.

570
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Understand?

571
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,960
Yes.

572
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Good.

573
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,200
Besides,

574
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,760
use short time for attack and defense.

575
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,400
Ding Li

576
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
As for the free debating,

577
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,280
you help

578
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
to push arguments forward at the end.

579
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,760
Okay.

580
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,680
In free debating,

581
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,880
all members defend and fight back.

582
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
For one target, which is

583
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,200
strengthen our arguments.

584
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,480
Tao Hao, you control the battlefield.

585
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,840
Xiaoyu, you stir things up.

586
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,240
Nan Bei, you make the last hit.

587
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,040
Ma Nan

588
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,800
You control your participation.

589
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,760
Add value at the end.

590
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,600
And state your closing argument.

591
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,040
Understand?

592
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,000
-Yes.  -Yes.

593
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,840
Brilliant!

594
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,800
In my opinion,

595
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,200
they have no strength to

596
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,360
unfold their own arguments.

597
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,640
They may try their best to

598
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,480
refute our arguments.

599
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,680
At this time,

600
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,840
as long as arguments stand, we will win.

601
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,640
Understand?

602
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:33,960
Yes.

603
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,240
Fighting!

604
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,400
Fighting.

605
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,840
Alright. Ready to get on the stage.

606
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,720
Besides,

607
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
the surgery of our old coach

608
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,080
is very successful.

609
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,080
Xiaoyu, come on!

610
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,040
Now we'll start rebuttal.

611
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
A random debater of each team

612
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,520
can start debating on the

613
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,560
above content.

614
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,680
Four minutes in total.

615
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,000
Please.

616
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,640
You said useless things are useful.

617
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,440
By what way do they change

618
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,160
into useful things?

619
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,600
In different time, space

620
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,520
and principal length to observe,

621
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,440
we'll find out

622
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
useless things are the most useful.

623
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,000
As the big tree seen by Zhuangzi.

624
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The big tree survived from

625
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
logger's axe because

626
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,440
it was not good timber.

627
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
So is the nature of things

628
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,760
objective

629
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,600
or subjective due to

630
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,480
people's observation?

631
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,680
Do things change

632
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,480
with the change of

633
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,040
the scale of observation?

634
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,720
Of course.

635
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,880
When I observe

636
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,480
at the atomic scale,

637
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,120
we can only see carbon.

638
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,160
When I go back to the macro scale,

639
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,120
I find out it's actually a diamond.

640
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
It is the specific array of

641
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,920
carbon atoms

642
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
that forms a diamond.

643
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,280
What I want to ask is

644
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,760
what you said.

645
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,520
In what way do the

646
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,160
useless things

647
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,040
become useful?

648
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
There is an inventor in Hebei Province

649
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,160
called Craftsman Geng.

650
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,120
He is specialized in inventing some

651
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,320
completely useless things.

652
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,440
And thus he goes viral online

653
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,560
and becomes a famous web celebrity.

654
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,080
Isn't it the usage of

655
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,880
useless things?

656
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,240
What if his inventions

657
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,840
are all useful?

658
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,480
It's not within the range of

659
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,600
the resolution we discuss today.

660
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,040
You dare not answer directly.

661
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,920
The inventions of Craftsman Geng

662
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,040
make him famous

663
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,520
because his inventions are useless.

664
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,640
Do you notice that?

665
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,040
The true value of useless things

666
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,880
is exactly their uselessness, right?

667
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
It's just its basic nature.

668
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,080
Of course, we have to admit

669
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,040
the basic nature, right?

670
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,520
Inventions of Craftsman Geng are useless,

671
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,280
so they're useful.

672
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Big trees have no usage for human,

673
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,440
so they're useful

674
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,000
for their survival.

675
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
You feel happy to

676
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,960
read comic books

677
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,720
because no one tests you.

678
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,960
If comic books were listed

679
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
as the content of exams,

680
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,040
they would become useful.

681
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,920
All usages of entertainment

682
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,480
and relaxation

683
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,000
would be gone.

684
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,040
The study of basic science

685
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,520
is not limited

686
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,920
because it has no clear

687
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
practical objectives.

688
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,280
And so we can unrestrainedly

689
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,080
explore the universe.

690
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
If the study of scientists

691
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,320
has to be useful,

692
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,960
the study of basic science

693
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
would be lifeless at all.

694
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,200
Therefore,

695
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
only when useless things are useless,

696
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,160
they are useful.

697
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,120
When they become useful,

698
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,280
they're useless. Right?

699
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,840
I doubt they have

700
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,320
more arguments.

701
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't let them elaborate.

702
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,560
Understand?

703
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,880
Coach. We have solutions.

704
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,000
I think I can beat them.

705
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,680
So, do you admit the premise?

706
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,000
I admit.

707
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,920
So, if my fellow debater

708
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,440
thinks the value

709
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,600
is to regard useless things

710
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
as useful things,

711
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,880
basically,

712
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,800
you have dissolved

713
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,280
the possibility that useless things are useful.

714
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,480
Thank you.

715
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,760
Regarding them as useful things

716
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
dissolves the foundation of usage.

717
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,680
Interesting.

718
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,240
To be honest,

719
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,040
I didn't expect

720
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,920
they would go even deeper.

721
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,880
Team AFF is so experienced.

722
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,040
In free debating,

723
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,000
they fought back right away.

724
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,600
Next, it's the most anticipated

725
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,520
and the most exciting

726
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,800
free debating.

727
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Four minutes for each team.

728
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,080
Team NEG goes first.

729
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,720
Let's confirm the consensus.

730
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,160
The premise of usage is useless.

731
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,960
Do you admit it?

732
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,440
Yes.

733
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,360
But another consensus is

734
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,400
the core of our debate,

735
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,760
which is how to evaluate useless things.

736
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,680
Why don't we look at the result

737
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,560
but the premise

738
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,600
when we evaluate something?

739
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,560
Don't my fellow debaters

740
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,680
look at the premise?

741
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,760
What is final judgment?

742
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,960
We can only evaluate when there's a result.

743
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,440
Right?

744
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,920
History of Philosophy

745
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,960
can be called a useless thing

746
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,560
from a secular perspective.

747
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,920
But countless wisdom it contains

748
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,000
can be seen everywhere,

749
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,120
benefiting us a lot.

750
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,440
Isn't it useful?

751
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Because it's not a practical subject,

752
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,720
it can be useful.

753
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,080
If it's targeted to practicality,

754
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,400
History of Philosophy would be called

755
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,320
Useful Philosophy in Life,

756
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,360
One Hundred Small Knowledge

757
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,120
or Business Expertise of

758
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,840
Wittgenstein.

759
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,880
Isn't your usage

760
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,280
greatly reduced?

761
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,560
Useless things can help people to

762
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,120
accumulate and grow up.

763
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,080
Aren't they useful?

764
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,800
Accumulation and growing up

765
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,280
are hard to be quantified.

766
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,520
How do you judge

767
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,640
whether they're useful or not?

768
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,200
No matter how small accumulation and growing up are,

769
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
they're still useful.

770
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,080
My fellow debater.

771
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,400
Don't do useless thing no matter how big it is.

772
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,040
Don't stop doing useful thing no matter how small it is.

773
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,760
What does she mean?

774
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,600
Yin Nan takes advantage of Xiaoyu,

775
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
asking Xiaoyu to call her dad.

776
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
The energy consumed by brain

777
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,360
takes 25% of the energy

778
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,920
consumed by the body.

779
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,040
It's the most energy-consuming organ.

780
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,680
According to what you said,

781
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,720
if I want to lose weight,

782
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,760
it's also useful to do advanced mathematics exercises.

783
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,680
It consumes energy of the brain.

784
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,320
Yes. So it's useful!

785
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,160
Although it's weak.

786
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,560
But doing exercises for a few days,

787
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,520
you find out that

788
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,320
you've gained one kilogram.

789
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,200
Is doing exercises useful

790
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,920
or not

791
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,280
for losing weight?

792
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
A careless weed can make a shade.

793
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Isn't it the usage of

794
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,360
useless things?

795
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,040
Good point.

796
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,520
We plant carelessly because

797
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,760
we don't think it's useful.

798
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,680
So surprise will

799
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,520
come, right?

800
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,640
After all, a careful planting cannot blossom.

801
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,920
Your first argument

802
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,720
talks about practicality.

803
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,520
But now you talk about

804
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,400
the resistance to utilitarianism.

805
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,600
Isn't it a self-conflict?

806
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,640
How?

807
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
Are practicality and

808
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,480
utilitarianism equal?

809
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,200
It's okay.

810
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,160
At least we've reached

811
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,840
another consensus.

812
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,600
We all think

813
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,560
the evaluation of useless things

814
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,560
is against utilitarianism.

815
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,760
But getting rid of utilitarianism

816
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,160
should rely on admitting value,

817
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,760
instead of

818
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
denying the value. Right?

819
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,600
No.

820
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,920
Getting rid of utilitarianism

821
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,720
isn't to endow

822
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,680
utilitarianism with non-utilitarianism,

823
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,440
but to admit that useless is useless.

824
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Useful evaluation

825
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,640
isn't to endow something,

826
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,240
but that it really has values.

827
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,680
It should be a question that

828
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,800
every debater has thought about.

829
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,720
Because debate itself

830
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
is a classically useless thing.

831
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,840
So how should we

832
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,680
evaluate debate?

833
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Do we tell our juniors that debate is useless,

834
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
and recruit less members

835
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
in the next year?

836
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,840
Or do we tell our team members that

837
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,720
debate is useless,

838
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,800
and let them lose morale

839
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
in the battle?

840
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,040
Or do I tell myself that debate

841
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,080
is useless,

842
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,000
and deny my efforts and

843
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
sweats that I've made?

844
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,080
We can find out countless

845
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,360
useful points of debate.

846
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,640
Training eloquence and thought,

847
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,280
sportsmanship,

848
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,120
etc.

849
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,800
Just like in this contest,

850
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
your excellent knowledge and

851
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,840
adept skills

852
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
can always be used.

853
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
So where on earth

854
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,360
are they used?

855
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
They are used to conquer the audience

856
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,040
and get the trophy.

857
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,080
See?

858
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,480
You're used to

859
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,360
looking for usage.

860
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
Because usage makes people feel at ease,

861
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,280
and makes people feel that they have values.

862
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,680
If let us

863
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,760
try to forget all of these.

864
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,200
Forget the opponent,

865
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,840
forget the audience,

866
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
forget the trophy,

867
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
and forget everything that is useful.

868
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,480
And think about

869
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,720
what

870
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,920
makes us prepare for the contest

871
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,000
in a small room.

872
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,600
What makes us quarrel

873
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,920
all night long?

874
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,680
What on earth

875
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,600
is it that is so charming to

876
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,080
make us fight for?

877
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,240
There's only one question:

878
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
Why aren't we willing to

879
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,000
admit uselessness?

880
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
As what you said,

881
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
the evaluation of useless things

882
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,640
can truly affect reality.

883
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,840
Is there

884
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,600
any difference between them?

885
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,560
Because we tend to choose

886
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,440
and care about those

887
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
what we think are useful.

888
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,000
We are born for benefits,

889
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
and we would die for benefits.

890
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,360
If we tell people

891
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,240
the thing is useless,

892
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,360
not packing it or endowing it

893
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,240
with any usage,

894
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,160
its value would be neglected.

895
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,880
That is what we're worried about.

896
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,520
For most of the people,

897
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,120
what on earth is the usage of useful things?

898
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,400
How much usage it has?

899
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,240
It's hard to say.

900
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,680
But the nap of Newton under the apple tree,

901
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,760
the string of Einstein,

902
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,680
and the howling of Li Bai

903
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,480
after drinking.

904
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,080
These

905
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,520
should not be neglected.

906
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
I know what you mean.

907
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,880
From philosophy, arts, to personal interests,

908
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,200
if it has a useful

909
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,840
consensus,

910
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,160
it can make more people

911
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,760
to pay attention to it,

912
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,840
accept it,

913
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
understand it, respect it,

914
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,840
and thus more free to

915
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,440
choose it.

916
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,480
We won't keep distance with something

917
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,640
just because it's useless.

918
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,040
If I didn't prepare for

919
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,800
the resolution,

920
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,040
I would never know that

921
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,400
there are still people who

922
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,920
look down upon video games.

923
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,240
There're still many people who think

924
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,040
it's useless to learn Chinese opera

925
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,120
just because nobody listens it.

926
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,960
There are even some people

927
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,760
and some groups

928
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,320
believe that reading is useless.

929
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,880
Defending that useless things

930
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
are useful

931
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,160
is to make useless things

932
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,960
as part of our

933
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,840
free choices.

934
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,800
However,

935
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,800
there seems to be a problem.

936
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,760
One has values only when it's deemed as useful.

937
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,080
One is worth choosing only when it's useful.

938
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,680
Actually, the topic

939
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,320
is always very utilitarian.

940
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
But we haven't

941
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,520
cared about it.

942
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,840
So we would feel anxious when we're

943
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,120
entertaining ourselves,

944
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
and blame ourselves at leisure time.

945
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,600
Invisibly,

946
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,720
each of us has strained our life

947
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,640
with useful things.

948
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,320
Only when we abandon usage,

949
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,200
just like what we're doing now,

950
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
only when we don't care about the contest,

951
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,000
can we truly feel

952
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,720
the real value of the contest.

953
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,960
Admitting the uselessness of useless things

954
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,640
is the biggest fight against

955
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,880
utilitarianism.

956
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
Only when we're willing to admit

957
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,800
one thing is useless.

958
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
When you dare to criticize

959
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,120
that a thing is useless.

960
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,520
When you dare to respect

961
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,360
that a thing is useless.

962
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,400
And when you still choose

963
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,800
and enjoy

964
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,640
the useless things

965
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,800
without scruple.

966
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,200
It's true freedom, isn't it?

967
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,240
Right.

968
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I hope we can all become

969
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,880
the one

970
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,800
who enjoys useless things.

971
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,040
And it helps us to

972
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,720
become

973
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,640
the most useful people.

974
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,720
Alright.

975
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,360
Let's vote for the

976
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,280
final result.

977
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,520
Come on.

978
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,080
To Team AFF, raise your hand.

979
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,480
Alright. Say something.

980
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,400
Say something. Say something.

981
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,240
Say something.

982
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,360
Nothing to say.

983
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,360
Act like a general.

984
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,520
It's time for the trophy.

985
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,920
Let's go.

986
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,360
Come on! Let's go!

987
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,760
They're becoming

988
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,720
more like a first-class team.

989
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,400
Team 235, the Team NEG,

990
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,320
is the champion of the provincial contest!

991
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,960
Congratulations!

992
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,480
The patient just sobered up.

993
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,360
Be quiet.

994
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,120
We're sorry.

995
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,480
Coach

996
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:24,880
Coach

997
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,240
How's the surgery?

998
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,840
Coach

999
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,960
Oh, right.

1000
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,400
Look at it.

1001
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,960
Coach. We won!

1002
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,680
Coach. We avenged.

1003
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,160
But the revenge of Nan Bei

1004
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,320
hasn't be taken yet.

1005
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,080
Coach. Thank you.

1006
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,960
Coach

1007
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,960
When will you regain your health?

1008
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,840
When you recuperate,

1009
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,240
let's eat hotpot together!

1010
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,080
You are great!

1011
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,320
Congratulations!

1012
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,960
Congratulations!

1013
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,080
Whoa!

1014
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,400
You look so handsome

1015
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,160
with this suit!

1016
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,800
Really!

1017
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,120
You look like a graduate now.

1018
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,680
Thank you.

1019
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,040
I really should express my

1020
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,280
gratitude to you.

1021
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:57,880
Wait.

1022
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,160
Don't do that.

1023
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,840
It's strange that you changed all of a sudden.

1024
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,080
Right. Don't be so polite.

1025
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,120
I just want to thank you.

1026
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,720
If

1027
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,040
it were not because of you,

1028
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,560
I might

1029
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,480
still be playing video games at dormitory now.

1030
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,200
Especially,

1031
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,080
I'll thank Hao.

1032
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,520
Because...

1033
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,520
Hao

1034
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,160
Tao Hao, I want to...

1035
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,120
Listen to me first.

1036
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,880
Mr. Li said

1037
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,200
the grade of your computer science

1038
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,080
couldn't be found anyway.

1039
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,160
Computer?

1040
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,160
Yes.

1041
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,440
It's a new compulsory subject

1042
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,480
newly added this year.

1043
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,480
Mr. Li said he told you

1044
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,520
at the beginning of the semester.

1045
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,400
You promised him that you would take it.

1046
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,360
Did you take it?

1047
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,400
Man!

1048
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,720
I thought everything's fine

1049
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,680
if I passed CET-4.

1050
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,680
Where does the computer emerge from?

1051
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,560
Mr. Li said

1052
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,720
the subject was newly added.

1053
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,440
All seniors

1054
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,200
have been informed.

1055
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,600
Maybe,

1056
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,880
only you, the fifth year student, was missed.

1057
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,560
Will you blame me?

1058
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,240
In your sixth year, there are 12 months.

1059
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,880
If the salary is 6,000 yuan,

1060
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,640
the total income of one year, reward added, is 76,000 yuan.

1061
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,600
Half of it is to pay the debt. 38,000 yuan is left.

1062
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,440
After doing this math,

1063
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,120
if you do two part-time jobs every month,

1064
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,360
you can earn 38,000 yuan.

1065
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,640
If you do this,

1066
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,640
I won't be angry.

1067
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,480
Where's your Liu Yanze?

1068
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,320
Wasn't he like a chewing gum,

1069
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,920
always sticking to you?

1070
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,680
Why is he not with you today?

1071
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,440
He said somebody suddenly looked for him.

1072
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,600
I don't know who the person is.

1073
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,120
Hey.

1074
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,880
What are they doing out there?

1075
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,600
So many people.

1076
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,920
Someone's confessing love!

1077
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Let's go and have a look.

1078
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,640
Wow!

1079
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,720
Oh my god!

1080
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,760
The scene looks so spectacular!

1081
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,280
She will definitely succeed!

1082
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,160
Why? Like what you experienced before?

1083
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,920
Do you know her? Good friends?

1084
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,320
No.

1085
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,040
But browsed from the Internet,

1086
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,600
every trick is like this.

1087
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,280
There has been no innovation

1088
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,080
for so long.

1089
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,440
But the lady looks

1090
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,280
beautiful.

1091
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,280
Where's the man?

1092
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,440
Why haven't I seen him?

1093
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,560
I haven't, either.

1094
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,160
My man!

1095
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,520
Sorry, I have...

1096
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,840
Hey!

1097
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm in charge of sanitation.

1098
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,760
What are you doing?

1099
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,080
Don't we need to clean up so many candles?

1100
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,520
Besides,

1101
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I'm Liu Yanze's

1102
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,560
girlfriend, Xiong Zishi.

1103
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,800
To whom are you going to confess love?

1104
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,280
Sorry.

1105
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,680
What does that mean?

1106
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,600
Explain it to me.

1107
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,040
I haven't been here for so long.

1108
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,440
This time,

1109
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,920
the mood is totally different from last time.

1110
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,680
Mood is different.

1111
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
But people are the same.

1112
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,040
Here you are.

1113
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,760
What is it?

1114
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,120
When I hold exhibitions in the future,

1115
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,680
these are all my private treasures.

1116
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,600
They're so valuable.

1117
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,280
When did you take so many

1118
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
photos of me?

1119
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
No retouching!

1120
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,960
You've been so beautiful.

1121
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,840
No need to retouch!

1122
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,240
How's that?

1123
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,000
Stop!

1124
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Nan Bei

1125
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,680
How's that? Is it ready?

1126
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,320
Right away.

1127
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,240
Let me see it.

1128
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,480
-Coach.  -Yes. The flight has been booked.

1129
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,840
Eat steamed pork stomach and chicken before departure.

1130
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,160
There's no such a dish in Europe.

1131
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,960
Tao Hao. Ma Nan. Come over here.

1132
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,240
Okay.

1133
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,880
I'm coming.

1134
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,040
I'm making tea for our old coach.

1135
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,960
We're coming.

1136
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
We're coming.

1137
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,080
Old coach.

1138
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,560
It's specially made for you.

1139
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,360
Thank you so much!

1140
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,080
Don't you need

1141
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,200
a cup of tea for each one?

1142
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,280
Nan Bei

1143
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,240
Are you going to take with this?

1144
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,680
Yes.

1145
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,440
Let me tell you.

1146
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
You must PS the photo!

1147
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,440
Of course.

1148
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,000
Wait me for a while.

1149
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,200
You're here.

1150
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,960
It's a photo of your Team Two.

1151
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,480
Is it appropriate for me to be with you?

1152
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,840
