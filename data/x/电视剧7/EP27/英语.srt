00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,120
Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP27

2
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,880
Can't sleep and can't get up.

3
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
What does the resolution mean?

4
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
It depends on the situation.

5
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,960
Right.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,640
Is it more painful not to be able to sleep at night?

7
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,720
Or is it more painful not to be able to get up in the morning?

8
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,240
Then the two sides can make casual statements.

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,440
There are no criteria for judgement.

10
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,320
Gosh!

11
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,680
I haven't slept

12
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
for forty-eight hours.

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,760
I really want to sleep!

14
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
I would like to reply the question of my fellow debater.

15
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,520
It's difficult to compare which one is more painful.

16
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,760
How about comparing

17
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,840
which one is less painful?

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,440
Then the other one is

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720
more painful.

20
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Then I would like to ask my fellow debater to tell me more.

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,720
If you can't get up in the morning,

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,400
the alarm clocks

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,560
and the fear of being late

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,160
will urge you to get up.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
But if you can't sleep at night,

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
there's no way to solve it.

27
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,640
You not only can't sleep now,

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
but have to worry about

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,880
not getting up in the morning.

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,280
Your pains double.

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,720
Compared with the alarm clock in the morning,

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,640
the phone call and being late,

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,800
which are considered as a triple fear,

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
it is less painful.

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,640
Won't you be painful if you can't get up?

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,560
You don't even get up. You are still sleeping.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,080
How could you be in pain?

38
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,960
Of course, the sober one

39
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,520
is more painful.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,360
Congratulations to Team 235

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
for winning this game.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Congratulations to the opposing side, Team of DUFE

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,920
for winning this game.

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,840
Our next rival is

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,040
from Poyang College.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,440
The team is called "floating in the waves".

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,320
They are good at interweaving arguments.

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,000
Because their arguments seem

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,440
simple.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
In fact...

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,840
In fact,

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
the point, line and surface are linked together,

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,680
which can defeat you straight away.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,600
The result of the game is now

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,760
in my hands.

56
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Stop shaking.

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
Congratulations to Team 235

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
for winning this game.

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,640
Congratulations!

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,840
Look.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,760
So, the most typical one is

62
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,960
about the trolley.

63
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,640
One for all, right?

64
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,680
Not really.

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,800
I think

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,040
the core

67
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
of the discussion now

68
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,240
is the democratic system.

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,120
Western democracy like

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,480
one man, one vote

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,200
often results in

72
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,840
violence by the majority.

73
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,720
Do you agree that this kind of

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
violence is also just?

75
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,000
It depends on the definition

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,720
of justice.

77
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,560
As the rule of

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,880
survival of the fittest in natural selection,

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,960
it's just.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Can I ask my fellow debaters one question?

81
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,000
If the violence of the majority

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
is conducive to the continuation of human civilization,

83
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,920
isn't it just?

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,120
Do you mean that

85
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,920
injustice to the individual

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,240
can lead to justice for the group?

87
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,560
No. That's not what I meant.

88
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,160
I think that

89
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,960
justice changes with the times.

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
So, is there a clear definition of

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,320
justice for the same period?

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,800
If there is,

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,960
aren't you making a self-contradicting?

94
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,520
If there isn't,

95
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,160
Then what is the real justice?

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600
The resolution is

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
should campus violence be severely sentenced?

98
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
My answer is yes.

99
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,800
Now,

100
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,680
how many children

101
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,000
are influenced by campus violence?

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,040
But

103
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,560
isn't this against

104
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
the rationality of the law?

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,520
The law is constantly improved.

106
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,600
If one advocates for a severe sentence,

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
it means that the sentence is too light now.

108
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
It's not that rational.

109
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,680
You have a point there.

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,480
Actually,

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
this is easily agreed upon

112
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
by both sides.

113
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
But the problem is

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,760
whether the result of the severe sentence is appropriate.

115
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,160
Campus violence cases are on the rise.

116
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,840
The severe sentence can

117
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,120
play an exemplary role, right?

118
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Is it right to take the so-called exemplary role

119
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,640
and sacrifice

120
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
the fairness and justice of the law?

121
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,800
The law allows

122
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,640
to take social values

123
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,600
into account when sentencing.

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,720
My fellow debater's understanding of

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,600
the fairness of the law is

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,520
biased, right?

127
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,360
Campus violence

128
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,240
is common

129
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,280
among minors.

130
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,560
Passionate violence dominates.

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
The exemplary role

132
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,600
is inherently weaker than that on adults.

133
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,960
With the continuous development of society,

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,720
the age of mental maturity

135
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,400
of adolescents

136
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,160
is advancing.

137
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,440
When adolescents' characters

138
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,400
are being formed,

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,000
if passionate violence

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,960
becomes habitual violence

141
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
or even violent values,

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,200
a light sentence for campus violence

143
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,400
will be harmful.

144
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,000
Congratulations to Team 235

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,120
for winning this game.

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,600
The winner is

147
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
Team 235.

148
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
Congratulations to them for advancing to the semi-final.

149
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,040
Let's go.

150
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,320
Our game is about to start, too.

151
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,680
This is the end.

152
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,280
My argument is complete.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
Anonymity has many drawbacks,

154
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,760
and many imperfections.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,880
But it guarantees

156
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,480
the ultimate purpose of the online discussion.

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,040
This purpose

158
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,640
can only be achieved

159
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,280
in a real sense in the online discussion.

160
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,640
It seems that

161
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,080
the result will be available soon.

162
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,000
I didn't expect that

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
we entered the final ahead of them.

164
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,160
This is the gap.

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,800
Never mind.

166
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,480
When they finish the game,

167
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
let's laugh at them.

168
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
Don't worry. Maybe they

169
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
won't enter the semi-final.

170
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,040
Fie!

171
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,880
The real-name system looks perfect

172
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,640
and civilized.

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,560
But it can't achieve the goal.

174
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,800
It fails.

175
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,480
So, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

176
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,960
Thank you.

177
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,680
Now,

178
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
I announce

179
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,760
the winner is

180
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,480
the affirmative side, Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics.

181
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,360
I don't know if I should be happy

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,600
or unhappy.

183
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,080
It's all right. Be confident in yourself.

184
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
This is the end of today's game.

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,640
The teams entering the semi-final

186
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,600
come in the afternoon

187
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
to decide the next game's resolution and motion.

188
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,520
Everyone was tired lately.

189
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,560
But,

190
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,200
there will be only two more games for us.

191
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
The two times

192
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,280
are really too close.

193
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,560
Don't worry, Hao.

194
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,240
We still have the awareness

195
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,920
of preparation for the game.

196
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,360
Okay.

197
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Then let's have look at

198
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
the resolution in the semi-final.

199
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
Accepting the reality and changing the reality.

200
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
Which one needs more courage?

201
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
Accepting the reality.

202
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,000
Why?

203
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,440
Because if you let me

204
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,080
accept

205
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,320
the debate we're going to have right now,

206
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,000
it would take a lot of courage.

207
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,800
I think that to accept that we are

208
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,840
the passive party

209
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
takes more courage.

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
Our motion is

211
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,880
to accept the reality needs more courage.

212
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,520
It's all over.

213
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,680
It's difficult.

214
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
But we still need to get it even if it is difficult.

215
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,400
So, it's even

216
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,240
more important

217
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,000
to start preparing for the debate.

218
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,120
I hope

219
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,040
there's no more

220
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,800
drama.

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,760
Extra! Extra!

222
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,560
I tell you.

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
Do you know who is

224
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,640
our next rivalry?

225
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,640
Nanjiang Drama Academy

226
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,080
Do you know

227
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,840
who is their leader?

228
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,960
Please draw the motion.

229
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,640
Hello. You can start.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,520
Senior

231
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,400
It's been a long time.

232
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,520
It's been a long time.

233
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,280
No wonder Sa was

234
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,800
so distracted these days,

235
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,200
and disappeared suddenly.

236
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,400
It seemed that he went to meet that girl.

237
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,560
What does she look like?

238
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,080
Right.

239
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
Anyway, to be with Sa,

240
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,480
she is aggrieved.

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,000
Is she tall?

242
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,760
She's tall.

243
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,960
Her skin is fair.

244
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,560
Is she fair-skinned?

245
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,440
Fairly white.

246
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,040
So, there's a reason

247
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,320
why the price of crude oil

248
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,000
can't come down now.

249
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,000
Right.

250
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,600
Yes.

251
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,000
Right?

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,360
Yes.

253
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,360
Sa

254
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:45,840
Uh?

255
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,000
Who is our rivalry in the next game?

256
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,080
Nanjiang Drama Academy.

257
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,080
It's the first time for us to play the provincial tournament.

258
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,240
We are not particularly

259
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,920
knowledgeable about the rivalry, either.

260
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,240
Right.

261
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
Do you know about Nanjiang Drama Academy?

262
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,640
I, I mean...

263
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
It's been so many years since graduation.

264
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,520
I don't know about the present Nanjiang Drama Academy.

265
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,600
But as for the Nanjiang Drama Academy six or five years ago,

266
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,520
I don't know well about it.

267
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,560
All right!

268
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
Let's

269
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
continue to discuss the resolution.

270
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,400
Can we rely on Dandan?

271
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Does he forget the mission

272
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,040
and have a date?

273
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,160
It's all right.

274
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
Even if he's dating,

275
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,360
he does that for Mr. Sa.

276
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,320
Well.

277
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,280
What is that crap?

278
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,600
What's going on?

279
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,400
What's going on?

280
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,360
Come on.

281
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I have a friend's

282
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,480
girlfriend

283
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,600
who was from Jiangnan Drama Academy.

284
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,160
Her future boyfriend's

285
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,960
confidant

286
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,160
is a member of the school debate.

287
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,560
We used

288
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,760
the comic, One Piece

289
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,080
as a token of love.

290
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,200
No, no, no. Watchword.

291
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,440
We met each other

292
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,080
at a lamb spine hot pot restaurant

293
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,960
in an alley.

294
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,560
When she saw me,

295
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
her mouth was nearly watering.

296
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,000
Tell us the point.

297
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,360
The point is that

298
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,280
the name of that girl is Diandian.

299
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
She is a schoolmate of Sa at college...

300
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,640
There are photos of them

301
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
on her phone.

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,520
What else?

303
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,520
That's all.

304
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,440
That's all?

305
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:36,920
Right.

306
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,800
Aren't there some stories?

307
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,800
Her teammates don't know about that.

308
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,440
They know as much as you do.

309
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,360
Then you went there for a long time,

310
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,280
what did you study?

311
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,000
If you want to know about

312
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,560
the confidant,

313
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
I even know

314
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,320
how many stray cats there are

315
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,080
in their neighborhood.

316
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
Accepting the reality needs more courage.

317
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,320
What's the main logic?

318
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The main logic is that

319
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,160
the reality will be more miserable.

320
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,960
Why?

321
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,320
If it's not miserable, why do you need courage?

322
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,360
If we all live in the

323
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,600
the Disney fairy tale,

324
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,800
we need nothing.

325
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,840
So, we now

326
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,600
agree that

327
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
the implicit premise of

328
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,000
this debate

329
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,720
is whether we should accept

330
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,400
or change the unpleasant reality in the face of it.

331
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,840
Is that right?

332
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,600
Right. Our motion is that

333
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,240
accepting the reality needs more courage.

334
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,520
Indeed. If we're faced with

335
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
an unpleasant decision,

336
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,520
but we have to accept,

337
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,520
it is quite courageous.

338
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,240
Right.

339
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,560
When we are faced with

340
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,800
an unsatisfactory reality,

341
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,200
our first reaction is to change it.

342
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
To overcome this impulse,

343
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
and to try accepting it

344
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,520
are really quite difficult.

345
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,720
In my opinion,

346
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,880
to try accepting it

347
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,920
is easier.

348
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,440
For example, when I once committed a mistake,

349
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
I borrowed money from everyone.

350
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,520
My first reaction is

351
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
to try to

352
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,840
cover the mistake.

353
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,720
Because the reality

354
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,560
is too frightening.

355
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
Everyone agrees that we are

356
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,920
the advantageous side this time, right?

357
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,800
I don't think so.

358
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,080
The reality is harsh.

359
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,120
It's difficult to change it.

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,120
When people

361
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,680
are faced with a more difficult

362
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,600
problem,

363
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,080
they need more courage.

364
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I don't think so.

365
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,320
Accepting a hard reality

366
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,160
is obviously more difficult.

367
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,600
If the reality doesn't

368
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,440
meet your expectations,

369
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
then let's go to

370
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,960
beat it up.

371
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,080
When you have been ravaged by reality

372
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,800
a hundred times,

373
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,880
you will feel that

374
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,320
it is easier to accept it.

375
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,440
You continue the discussion.

376
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm going to

377
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,400
clean the car.

378
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,800
One hundred...

379
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
You deserted me,

380
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,800
our debate team,

381
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
and our dream

382
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,480
for three years.

383
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,840
Have we promised

384
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,760
to be teammates

385
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,440
of each other forever?

386
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,720
Diandian

387
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,320
Please forgive me.

388
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,640
I have to go back to my hometown.

389
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,840
Like an ostrich,

390
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,360
forget everything.

391
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,800
No. I don't want to forget that.

392
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
Let me stay

393
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,960
with our dream.

394
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,200
I will take our school team

395
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,400
to the provincial tournament.

396
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,160
No.

397
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,040
It's not worth it for my sake.

398
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,000
I will wait.

399
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I will be here

400
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
to wait for you.

401
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,080
Many years later...

402
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,920
Diandian

403
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,240
You are really waiting for me.

404
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,200
The heat is killing me.

405
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
The heat is killing me.

406
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,120
How's it?

407
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,600
When Sa comes here later,

408
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,520
we are going to

409
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,200
show him this.

410
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,360
We hope it will encourage him.

411
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,880
I think it is

412
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,600
a good show.

413
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,520
But I am a little worried that

414
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,600
Sa will

415
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,320
thinks that

416
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,520
you are satirizing him.

417
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,680
How can that happen?

418
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,600
We are so sincere.

419
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,680
Right? We are sincere.

420
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,440
Hey.

421
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,160
Do you think

422
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,200
Sa is a slag man

423
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,520
because he left ruthlessly?

424
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,560
I don't think so.

425
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,280
They all had a special emotion

426
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,960
with each other.

427
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,640
What's more,

428
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,280
they were not

429
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,120
in a relationship.

430
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,840
The emotion which is more intimate than friendship, but less than love is the most difficult situation.

431
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,480
Sa

432
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,320
must have had no choice

433
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,280
but to return here that year.

434
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,320
They lived in different places.

435
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,400
What pitiful lovers!

436
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,600
Wait.

437
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,080
Our three pairs of lovers will be in different places

438
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,520
after graduation.

439
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,400
The long-distance relationship

440
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,440
ranks the top one

441
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,640
on the list of breaking up after graduation.

442
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,840
It's okay.

443
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,400
Where Xiaoyu is going to in the future,

444
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,400
I will go there as well.

445
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,480
Anyway, I am a talent.

446
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,600
No matter where I am,

447
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,800
I will have a bright future like a leaping monkey.

448
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,680
A leaping monkey.

449
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,400
I have negotiated with Ma Nan.

450
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,360
We will stay at the same place

451
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,840
to make our mortgage payments.

452
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,920
You have already planned.

453
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,320
But I...

454
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,560
I will also

455
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,000
go with Yanze.

456
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,400
I will go where he goes.

457
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,480
Ma Nan, what are you looking at?

458
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,200
Sa

459
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,560
You are perverted to have this fetish.

460
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,640
You don't stare at juniors.

461
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,000
You stare at the middle-aged man.

462
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,280
He is dating with

463
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,600
the girl who is called Diandian.

464
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,320
What?

465
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,120
Really?

466
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,800
Senior

467
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,800
How have you been all these years?

468
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,400
Just so-so.

469
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,280
I just didn't expect to

470
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
see you here.

471
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,520
I feel happy.

472
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm not surprised.

473
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,720
Since you played the points race

474
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,800
as the team two,

475
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,080
I've been following you guys.

476
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,560
Although you were not

477
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,480
in a good situation at that time,

478
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,360
I believe

479
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,840
we will meet

480
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,600
in the provincial tournament.

481
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,680
Diandian

482
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,160
Actually,

483
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,080
we almost failed several times.

484
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
The team you lead

485
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,680
must be fine.

486
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,320
Diandian

487
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,480
You...

488
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,560
How have you been

489
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,880
all these years?

490
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,000
Not bad.

491
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,920
After you left,

492
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,000
I led the debate team

493
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,560
to enter the provincial tournament.

494
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
Although we stopped at the last eight,

495
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,240
the grade of us was not bad.

496
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,840
Then I started to take part in the entrance exams for postgraduate schools.

497
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,040
I didn't think

498
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,120
it would be easy

499
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,960
to get into our school as a postgraduate.

500
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,520
So, I still had time

501
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,920
to train the debate team.

502
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,720
Then the debate team did not do well.

503
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,520
When I was in my second year as a postgraduate,

504
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,240
I met two excellent juniors.

505
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,920
The debate team once again entered the provincial tournament.

506
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,840
How do you feel?

507
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,600
Am I completing

508
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
our team's ambition before you?

509
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,120
You are better than me.

510
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Do you still

511
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
remember the past?

512
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,960
Of course.

513
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,040
You were saying 800 times a day

514
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,800
to advance to the provincial tournament.

515
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,280
How could I ever forget that?

516
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,440
Well.

517
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,000
Did you do that

518
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,960
for me?

519
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,560
What are you thinking about?

520
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,440
I always want to stay in Shanghai.

521
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,320
As for me,

522
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,400
the simplest way is to be a postgraduate

523
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,920
of our school and work in our school.

524
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,720
Besides,

525
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,480
debating is my strength.

526
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,400
Our school is now paying special attention to me.

527
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,360
Okay.

528
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,800
Well.

529
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,160
Pretty good.

530
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,600
Right.

531
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,200
It's pretty good.

532
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,280
But what is much better is that

533
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,160
you become

534
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,920
a coach of the debate team again.

535
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,840
Nope.

536
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,600
I am just an agent coach.

537
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
My professor is the real one.

538
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,080
But you do it well.

539
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
I heard from the staff

540
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,320
that you are already

541
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
an excellent devil coach.

542
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,840
Slander.

543
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,280
Do you think that I am an evil coach?

544
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,320
Of course not.

545
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,840
In my mind,

546
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,200
you are always a little girl.

547
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,520
You don't think

548
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,880
I'm staying for you,

549
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,720
do you?

550
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
Of course not.

551
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,240
Of course not.

552
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,400
That's right.

553
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm staying for you.

554
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,080
Why do you know

555
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,600
what they are talking about?

556
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,400
I can read lips.

557
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,120
Why don't you tell us earlier?

558
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
What did they talk about?

559
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,120
Well.

560
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,800
Actually, the thing is...

561
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,960
Those who hear it are sad.

562
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,840
Those who hear it are tearful.

563
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,120
It's heroic and moving.

564
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
Heroic and moving.

565
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,440
Really.

566
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,560
Come on.

567
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,520
Okay. Okay.

568
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,200
How can this be?

569
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,560
What does Sa think about?

570
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,840
Diandian must be waiting for him.

571
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,480
I agree.

572
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,720
I've seen the payroll

573
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,480
of Sa.

574
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,840
With Diandian's good look and talent,

575
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,520
being a counselor is unworthy.

576
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,520
I agree.

577
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,760
Diandian has been

578
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,160
thinking of helping Sa to complete his dream.

579
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,960
In the end,

580
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,120
it became her own dream.

581
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,040
We are clear-headed because we are bystanders.

582
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,600
We do not know

583
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,640
if Diandian knows

584
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,840
Sa's emotion.

585
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,680
Hey! What's up?

586
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,840
Why are you here?

587
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,920
The same as you.

588
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,840
Comics?

589
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,520
Right.

590
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,560
Everyone is preparing for the semi-final.

591
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,640
You are here reading comics.

592
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,200
Aren't you frightened that Hao will scold at you?

593
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,800
I am preparing for the race.

594
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,480
Otherwise,

595
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,240
where do you think

596
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,320
I got those life lessons and examples

597
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,200
in my closing arguments?

598
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,240
From comics?

599
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,040
Right.

600
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,800
Look.

601
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,520
What?

602
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,120
Naruto.

603
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Do you know why

604
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,040
Sakura finally succeeded being with Sasuke

605
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,800
when so many people

606
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,640
love Sasuke?

607
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,400
I don't know.

608
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,760
Because she is persistent.

609
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,760
Listen to me.

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,120
There are many girls

611
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,160
having crush on Sasuke.

612
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,640
But,

613
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,760
they all have secrets or problems they don't want to reveal.

614
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,480
They dare not to show their love.

615
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,000
Only Sakura dares to show her love.

616
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,520
And she keeps showing her love.

617
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
But she was rejected over and over again.

618
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,440
Finally, she doesn't care whether she will be loved.

619
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,120
Sakura

620
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,800
really loves

621
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,960
Sasuke.

622
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,640
Is it him?

623
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
Look. He's handsome.

624
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,040
The young version of me.

625
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,760
But,

626
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,720
Sakura has the body of a woman

627
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,640
and the mind of a child.

628
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,040
She's incapable of dealing with matters.

629
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,240
She also knows that

630
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,920
she is worse than others at many aspects.

631
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,560
But why is she so persistent?

632
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,440
Why?

633
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
Because

634
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,120
she knows that

635
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,400
she won't encounter a better one.

636
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,400
Do you get it?

637
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,200
She is so realistic.

638
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,240
At the age of 30 years old,

639
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
isn't it good to be realistic?

640
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,600
It makes sense.

641
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,680
I tell you.

642
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
Actually, Sasuke also knows that

643
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,320
he owns a lot to Sakura,

644
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
and he feels sorry for Sakura.

645
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,600
But it doesn't matter.

646
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,760
After they are together with each other,

647
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,720
everything will be paid back.

648
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,640
What's more,

649
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,040
it's hard to say

650
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,680
who is more advantageous.

651
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
You mean me?

652
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,200
I said I was working on the debate.

653
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,760
Bro

654
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,520
Do you know that?

655
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,760
Sometimes it's really difficult

656
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,520
to change the reality.

657
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,800
It's much more difficult than what you imagine.

658
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,000
I didn't even know

659
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,880
what I could do

660
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,640
if I stayed.

661
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,280
If you have another chance

662
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,080
will you stay?

663
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,280
Of course.

664
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,640
There is no more chance.

665
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,000
You are so anxious.

666
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,560
Are you afraid to face the reality

667
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,440
or afraid to face

668
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,600
the past of your own behavior?

669
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,440
I think

670
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,760
accepting the reality is more difficult than solving it.

671
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,680
So,

672
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,080
why do you put yourself in an awkward situation?

673
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,960
You can choose

674
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,840
a simpler way

675
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,000
to solve it, right?

676
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,240
This is a good point.

677
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,320
I will write it down.

678
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,280
Does this book

679
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,440
tell

680
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,120
the story of the two of them?

681
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,520
I don't know. I have not finished reading it.

682
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,920
What I said just now was what I guess.

683
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,000
Senior

684
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,760
Well.

685
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,760
It's so late.

686
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,600
What do you want from me?

687
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,680
I just passed by a bookstore

688
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,440
and saw this comic updated.

689
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,040
I remember you like it.

690
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,080
So, I bring it to you on the way.

691
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,480
Do you still remember that?

692
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Uh-huh!

693
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,560
I just read some pages.

694
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
Sakura and Sasuke

695
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,520
are interesting.

696
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,640
You are right.

697
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,080
I will tell you if there's a chance later.

698
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,840
Do you come here

699
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,640
to give me the comic?

700
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,120
No.

701
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,640
I just

702
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,120
come here to give you the comic.

703
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,400
Thank you.

704
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,520
You are welcome.

705
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,840
I got to go.

706
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,120
Be careful.

707
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,720
Okay.

708
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,120
Diandian, I'm sorry.

709
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,680
I went back hometown after graduation then.

710
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,880
You were left in Shanghai alone.

711
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,760
Actually, I was worried about you.

712
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,640
But I dared not to contact with you.

713
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,520
Because I don't know

714
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,320
how to face you.

715
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,560
At first, I thought that you would

716
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,080
be back hometown after graduation.

717
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,880
But from a friend,

718
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,600
I knew that

719
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,720
you had worked at school.

720
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,600
I did not think that

721
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,840
my aggressive words at youth

722
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,560
would make you pay for it

723
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,320
for so many years.

724
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,520
I owe you an apology.

725
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm sorry.

726
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,120
You're still asking about me, right?

727
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,080
Right.

728
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm always asking about you.

729
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,960
Ah!

730
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,280
It's not for you.

731
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,680
Although it was you

732
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,000
who said we must enter the provincial tournament,

733
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,840
that was my dream as well.

734
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,360
I stay here for myself.

735
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,360
Besides,

736
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,880
I did what

737
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,240
you didn't do.

738
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
I'm so proud.

739
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,280
Then I'm relieved

740
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,400
to know that you're having a happy life.

741
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,560
Is it enough to be relieved?

742
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,640
No. Not enough.

743
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
Not enough?

744
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
Except that you are sorry,

745
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,880
You have nothing else

746
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,800
to say to me, right?

747
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,440
I have.

748
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,280
I have a lot of words to say to you.

749
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,680
Which aspect do you mean?

750
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,360
For example,

751
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,640
I miss you as well.

752
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,800
I miss you as well.

753
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,640
I keep missing you.

754
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,280
When I see others debating,

755
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,000
I would think about you.

756
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,120
Well.

757
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,720
It's too late.

758
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,680
There's a game tomorrow.

759
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,080
How about

760
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,600
having a rest early?

761
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,280
Okay.

762
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,840
Well.

763
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,960
Good night.

764
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,200
Good night.

765
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,440
After the game,

766
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,640
I will take you for a good stroll, okay?

767
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,640
Okay.

768
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,520
Okay.

769
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,040
Good night.

770
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,480
Good night.

771
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,760
What's the matter?

772
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,120
What were you doing

773
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,840
last night?

774
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,760
Sa

775
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,120
You are here.

776
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,280
Hao, what are you going to do?

777
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,240
As for the resolution,

778
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,000
we can't figure it out.

779
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,640
You scared me!

780
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,640
I thought you were playing

781
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,360
a ghost movie here.

782
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,240
Okay, tell me.

783
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,120
How's the preparation going?

784
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,880
We have thought for a night.

785
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,080
Nothing at all.

786
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,000
Why are you so active today?

787
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,920
Do you have something with Diandian?

788
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,040
No.

789
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,640
Really?

790
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,800
Yes.

791
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,200
Bastard.

792
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,720
Well.

793
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,680
I won't

794
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,120
make her so sad later.

795
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,000
I mean

796
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,480
We worked day and night

797
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,240
to prepare for the game.

798
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,160
But you

799
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,520
you are in love.

800
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,320
Is it your own wishful thinking?

801
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,360
Or does Diandian

802
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,840
revive the former affection for you?

803
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Of course...

804
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,240
It should be the latter one.

805
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,600
Did Diandian tell you that?

806
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,160
I guess.

807
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,720
Really?

808
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,240
Look. Hot pot.

809
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,200
Goodbye.

810
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,120
If slapping on the head is a sign of love,

811
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,280
Xiaoyu has loved me

812
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,800
since the first day

813
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,720
she met me.

814
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,840
Hey!

815
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,320
Sa

816
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,360
It's good to be innocent.

817
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,920
But at the age of over 30 years old,

818
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,240
it's shameful

819
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,480
to be single and innocent.

820
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,720
What do you think?

821
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,200
It depends on yourself.

822
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
What do you think?

823
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,080
Do you want to be in love with her again?

824
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,400
Or do you want to

825
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,920
let her take her luggage alone,

826
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,320
and embark on a lonely train

827
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,920
to Shanghai which is in the cold winter after the game?

828
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,720
Then you will never see each other forever.

829
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,480
I have to choose the former one.

830
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,800
That's a good choice.

831
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,320
Don't worry. We will help you.

832
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,520
Does Diandian have a boyfriend?

833
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,040
Perhaps no.

834
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,160
You even don't know about that.

835
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,840
Give me your phone. Let me check.

836
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Debate game, library and comic store.

837
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,600
It seems that she doesn't have one.

838
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,320
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

839
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,600
How do you know that?

840
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,320
I have asked their teammates.

841
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Then hurry up to date with Diandian.

842
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,040
Hao

843
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,840
Why are you so gossipy now?

844
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,280
In accordance with your character,

845
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,200
you should say that like this.

846
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,760
Alright!

847
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,280
They will deal with

848
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
their own affections.

849
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,520
We shouldn't intervene.

850
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,120
Anyway, we have intervened a lot.

851
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,280
It doesn't matter now.

852
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,960
Do you want to have dinner together?

853
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Well. Why do you all look like

854
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,560
you're gonna give a birth?

855
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,440
Why are you nervous?

856
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,600
But I have to

857
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,360
teach tonight.

858
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
How about

859
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,440
ordering take outs and having dinner at the hotel?

860
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,120
Having dinner at the hotel.

861
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,000
Wow!

862
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,680
Oh, my god!

863
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,680
I noticed that

864
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,440
you spoke with a big breath.

865
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,200
Do you practice the vital capacity?

866
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,400
I don't know whether

867
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,720
her taste changes.

868
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,520
Don't worry.

869
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,560
We got omnipotent Shui.

870
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,280
Here are what you want.

871
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,240
Please enjoy!

872
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,000
Goodbye.

873
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,400
It's easy to break the point.

874
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,240
Change it.

875
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,520
I got it.

876
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,000
The refutation is not incisive.

877
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,640
It is easy for the other side to master the rhythm.

878
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,880
Improve it this night.

879
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,680
Continue.

880
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,640
Okay, Ms. Dian.

881
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,240
This is the result of

882
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,080
the preparation all day, right?

883
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,360
Did you enter the previous games

884
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
by luck?

885
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,640
Am I interrupting you?

886
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,800
No.

887
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,360
No.

888
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,960
How about waiting for me for a while?

889
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
I help them to check the materials.

890
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,720
Okay, I...

891
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,200
Diandian

892
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
We are not in a hurry.

893
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
I'm a little hungry.

894
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,640
Is there anyone wanting to have dinner?

895
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,720
I, I, I.

896
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,200
Let's go.

897
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,080
Diandian, see you later.

898
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,640
They are so scared of you!

899
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,520
Am I mean?

900
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,200
Of course not.

901
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,080
You are definitely not mean.

902
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,360
Well.

903
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,040
I don't know if your tastes

904
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,560
have changed.

905
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,440
No. Nothing changed.

906
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,120
Come on.

907
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,040
We used to spend all night

908
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,160
in the training room

909
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,320
preparing for the race like now.

910
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,920
Yes.

911
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
When I'm watching them

912
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,040
play,

913
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,280
I feel as if

914
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm back to school, too.

915
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,200
After the provincial tournament,

916
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,480
let's go back to school.

917
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,960
Good idea.

918
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,800
I have not been back for a long time.

919
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
It seems to be our first time

920
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,720
as rivals.

921
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,280
My fellow debaters,

922
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
you have to try your best.

923
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,800
We are great.

924
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,160
There will be no mercy.

925
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,680
How about showing us a little mercy.

926
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,200
Well, are you afraid?

927
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm afraid.

928
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,240
Here.

929
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,760
It's too greasy. You should eat more.

930
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,320
You are still particular about food.

931
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,160
How skinny you are now!

932
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,920
Under high pressure of the tournament,

933
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,800
you'd better eat more.

934
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,280
You are strong. You need to eat more.

935
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,520
Well. I will eat more.

936
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,720
I got to go.

937
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,440
Be careful!

938
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,440
Well. Do you have arrangements tomorrow?

939
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,680
We will compete with each other tomorrow.

940
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,720
Right.

941
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,920
What will you do after the game?

942
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,240
After the game,

943
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,400
I will take a plane to be back to Shanghai.

944
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,800
What a hurry!

945
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,200
I promised to take you

946
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,760
for a good stroll.

947
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,400
Do you have something urgent?

948
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,600
I need to get back in time for my visa.

949
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,920
Next month,

950
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,400
I will go to Canada.

951
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,200
Well.

952
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,160
Okay.

953
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,080
Have a good journey!

954
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,320
Okay.

955
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,320
Try your best tomorrow.

956
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,560
So do you.

957
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,200
Sa

958
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
You and Diandian...

959
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,480
Sa

960
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,320
I got a bottleneck.

961
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,520
Listen.

962
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
The other side has a particularly important

963
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:13,880
argument.

964
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,440
There is a part of reality

965
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,840
which is impossible

966
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,520
to achieve.

967
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,040
When you are faced with the reality,

968
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,240
you still need to change it.

969
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,800
Then there is a kind of desperation and sadness

970
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,440
that you know you can't do it, but you have to do it.

971
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,520
Do you think that

972
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
it needs more courage

973
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,200
than accepting it?

974
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,080
At that time,

975
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,640
when I decided to leave Diandian,

976
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,040
it was the toughest time for me.

977
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,520
I was thinking about the question all the time.

978
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,160
But that's the reality.

979
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,000
I was hopeless.

980
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,520
You're really leaving.

981
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
Senior, we have entered the provincial tournament.

982
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,840
Isn't it your dream?

983
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,640
If you really want to go,

984
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,080
let's finish the game together.

985
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,720
Okay?

986
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,840
Diandian

987
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,320
I really want to stay here.

988
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,000
But,

989
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,600
the company has notified me

990
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,280
to start working.

991
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,160
After all, we have to

992
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,960
face the life.

993
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,800
Why?

994
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm sorry, Diandian.

995
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,320
I should have

996
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,840
faced it together with her.

997
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,120
So, how do you define the reality?

998
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,720
How to define the reality?

999
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,880
The objectively existing reality.

1000
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,280
The unchangeable status quo.

1001
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,880
It's

1002
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,840
difficult for people

1003
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,320
to really see the complete reality.

1004
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,360
Most of the time,

1005
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,960
it's just the reality

1006
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,920
what we think.

1007
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,440
To conclude,

1008
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,840
we are too weak.

1009
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,840
A good argument.

1010
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,160
Sa

1011
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,200
Since the argument is so good,

1012
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,120
let's discuss the resolution.

1013
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,360
on this argument.

1014
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,720
Right. Don't worry about me.

1015
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I'm an adult.

1016
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,440
I can be responsible for my decision.

1017
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,800
Go ahead. Prepare for it.

1018
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,640
At that time,

1019
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,720
I spent countless nights

1020
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,600
like this

1021
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,400
with Diandian.

1022
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,240
At that time,

1023
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,400
we supported each other like this.

1024
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,240
We are discussing the resolution.

1025
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,760
Let's take a photo.

1026
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,800
At that time,

1027
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,120
We took selfies like this.

1028
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,640
At that time...

1029
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,920
I have a melatonin tablet here.

1030
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,440
How about taking it and

1031
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,520
going back home to have a sleep?

1032
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,440
Why do you take it?

1033
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,720
Do you have a bad sleep?

1034
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,560
I can't write my closing argument.

1035
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,080
Well.

1036
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,320
Let me do that.

1037
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,680
You can't be lenient

1038
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,880
because of Diandian.

1039
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,680
At that time,

1040
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,600
I was the Best Debater of Nanjiang Drama Academy.

1041
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,400
Golden Speaker Four

1042
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,840
It seems that there is a reason

1043
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,720
why Nanjiang Drama Academy has not been famous.
