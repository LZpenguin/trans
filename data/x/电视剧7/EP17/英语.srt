Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP17

2
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,840
I called a take-away.

3
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,840
A take-away.

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,920
I haven't eaten deep-fried dough sticks for a long time.

5
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,200
Oh, deep-fried dough sticks are tasty.

6
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,520
Let me try one.

7
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,320
Mom, I'd like to have a talk with you.

8
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,240
About your major?

9
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,600
We parents

10
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,240
don't mean to meddle in this matter.

11
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
After all, what we know

12
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
is also limited.

13
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,080
We are aging.

14
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,760
There are many things

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,240
that we know less than you.

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,480
How about

17
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,520
telling us more about

18
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
the international trade major?

19
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Yes.

20
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
If you refuse to say something,

21
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,280
I will consider that you get nothing

22
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,920
to refute me.

23
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,720
I'll say something.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,600
I'll say something.

25
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,240
Go ahead.

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
I chose this major

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
not only because I like it

28
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,240
but I also did a lot of homework.

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
Our major

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,160
is more than just a little.

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
What we are going to learn includes

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
policies and guidelines for foreign trade,

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,640
and operating rules of the international market.

34
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,840
These things,

35
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
if I work in the financial area,

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
will be absolutely useful.

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,800
Secondly, the employment prospect.

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,000
Recently,

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Those foreign-related joint ventures

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,680
value the graduates

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,440
from our major very much.

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,360
Professional segmentation

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
is becoming increasingly targeted.

44
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,280
It is true that

45
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,880
financial major is promising as well.

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,600
But the best may not be the fittest.

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,080
Right? Mom

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,440
Did you remember last time

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,120
the coat you adored

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,920
was only S size available?

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,040
Your size is XXL.

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,760
You can't buy it home

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,240
just because it's pretty.

54
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,800
Right? Dad

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,160
You are right.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Who, who is wearing XXL size?

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,280
My point is

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,320
mom, you can't make decisions

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,840
only from the good things online.

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,680
After all, I

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
still have two years for studying.

62
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,440
Hum.

63
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,760
Have you thought it over?

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,800
Fine.

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,120
As you like.

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,760
You, both of you

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,720
won't persuade me anymore?

68
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,400
No.

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,440
I'm telling you that

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,200
don't come back to us crying

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,080
if you fail in the future.

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,080
Hey.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,360
Sweetie

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
As long as you have faith in yourself,

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
we have faith in you too.

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,320
Absolutely I have, dad.

77
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,160
Have breakfast.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,960
Who is it?

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,760
Who is it?

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,480
A commercial text.

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
I don't think so.

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,960
Hum.

83
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,120
You still know how to come back?

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
What did you do last night?

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,680
Your dad said that he had been waiting for you.

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,600
I don't know what he meant.

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,440
Xiaobei, Xiaobei, where is my toilet paper?

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,280
Xiaobei, haven't you come back?

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,560
When others come home,

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,280
they help parents do housework.

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,240
Look at you.

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,920
You play the smartphone or computer games

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,560
all day long.

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,160
You even didn't sweep the floor.

95
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
I'll go out to buy groceries.

96
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
Do clean the house for me.

97
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,400
How old are you?

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,480
Still so sloppy

99
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,120
that run outside in pajamas.

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,480
Change your clothes.

101
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,160
In the Spring Festival Day,

102
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,760
you don't know

103
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,560
how to clean yourself up.

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,440
If you continue like this,

105
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,080
how could you find a girlfriend?

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,320
Go back as soon as your school starts.

107
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,720
Really!

108
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,080
Alas!

109
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,640
Ah.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,520
Well,

111
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,440
We should have eaten more.

112
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
What if I can't enjoy a reunion dinner

113
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,840
in the New Year's Eve?

114
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,680
What if I can't swallow it?

115
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
Ah.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,520
Well,

117
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm telling you that

118
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,920
today is our girl's

119
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,840
first time cooking.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
We have to eat

121
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,280
even if it is as inedible

122
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
as slop.

123
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,000
Clear?

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,280
Ah.

125
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Slop.

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,640
Hey.

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,080
Stop eating.

128
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,080
Put it back.

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,560
Dad.

130
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,760
You've cleaned for a whole day.

131
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
Sweeping and wiping

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
are cleaner than licking.

133
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Since your major matters were settled,

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,920
your mom has taken a load off her mind.

135
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,200
So

136
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,640
She is busy getting ready for the Spring Festival.

137
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,120
How about

138
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
telling her that

139
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,200
you change your major again?

140
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,480
No.

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,240
She can't leave us alone without a dinner.

142
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,760
What should we eat for dinner?

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Just a meal. I can handle it.

144
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,160
Alas.

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,760
Wait for a second.

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
More dishes are to be served.

147
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,120
More,

148
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,280
more and more.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,080
OK.

150
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,840
I've made it. Come and have dinner.

151
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,640
Oh.

152
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,920
Dinner is ready.

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,480
Well.

154
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,280
Oh yeah.

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,200
A reunion dinner made by our girl.

156
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,360
Is it edible?

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,480
Help yourself.

158
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,080
Take a seat.

159
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,320
Sit down.

160
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,680
Sit.

161
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,400
Oh

162
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,960
Sit.

163
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,200
For mom.

164
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,720
For myself.

165
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,760
Dad, give mom's chopsticks.

166
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,040
All right.

167
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,000
Ah,

168
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm exhausted.

169
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
Enjoy your meal.

170
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,280
Okay.

171
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,280
Begin to eat.

172
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,280
After you.

173
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,640
I tasted them.

174
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,720
They are delicious, OK?

175
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,760
I'll try.

176
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,960
Tasty.

177
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,400
Awesome.

178
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,280
Ah.

179
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,720
My sweetie, they are awesome.

180
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Well done!

181
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
Maybe this is talent.

182
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,200
Really delicious!

183
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,440
Have a toast

184
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,640
to our little chef.

185
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,880
Happy New Year.

186
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
Dad

187
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
Even if the dishes are inedible,

188
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,960
you can't drink all the time.

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,040
If my mom discovers

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,120
that I allow you to drink secretly again,

191
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,040
she will scold me again when she comes back.

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,280
You can choose the major you like,

193
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,920
and do whatever you like in the future.

194
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,040
I'm happy for you.

195
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,880
Now you are talking.

196
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
Why did you perform a show at home

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
with my uncle?

198
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,440
That was following your mom's order.

199
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
From my heart, I think

200
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,480
you should

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,800
do whatever you like.

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
Were you

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,160
determined to go to a state-owned enterprise from childhood

204
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,400
and then your career has flourished since then?

205
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,360
Childish

206
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,480
When I was playing music,

207
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,360
there are countless young and beautiful ladies

208
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,400
chasing me.

209
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,680
Playing music?

210
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,360
Yes.

211
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,880
Dad, these are just a few dishes.

212
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Haven't you drunk too much?

213
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Wait for a second.

214
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,120
Take a look.

215
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,200
Oh my Gosh.

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,880
Dad,

217
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
I didn't imagine that you were also

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,040
a boy with stories.

219
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,200
At that time,

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
we formed a bank

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,640
with a few buddies.

222
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,640
We sang all day long tirelessly

223
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,440
with no rival in my youth.

224
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,800
Your mom,

225
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
was fond of

226
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,240
my uninhibited love of freedom in those years.

227
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,720
Why did you go to a state-owned enterprise

228
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,440
living a life line points?

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,280
Because you were born.

230
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
My age

231
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,480
is not like yours.

232
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,280
No matter how well I play music,

233
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,080
I can't earn the money for your milk powder.

234
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,680
Did my mom agree?

235
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,040
Your mom has always been on my side.

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,160
At that time,

237
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,280
I always thought that music

238
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,560
was the most important thing in my life.

239
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,400
But afterwards I found out that

240
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,680
you are the most precious part in my life.

241
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,400
Happy New Year, Chubby Dango.

242
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,920
What are you doing?

243
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,240
You haven't answered my phone for so long.

244
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,760
I just made a full, formal banquet

245
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,360
for two distinguished parents

246
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,280
in my family.

247
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,240
Well,

248
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
even if auntie

249
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
disagrees with your chosen major,

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
you don't have to embarrass her in this way.

251
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,600
What are you talking about?

252
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,680
My dishes are very tasty.

253
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,160
Besides,

254
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,920
my mom agreed.

255
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
Really?

256
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,760
How did you brainwash her?

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,560
Of course, it's due to your Sister Yu's

258
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,600
excellent adaptability

259
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,400
and

260
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
outstanding speaking skills

261
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
and a series of non-violent measures.

262
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,280
Finally, she agreed.

263
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,920
What about you? Is everything going well?

264
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,000
My parents still insist that

265
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,800
I should choose a major related with editing.

266
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,040
Although the final decision

267
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,880
is up to me,

268
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
I still need to convince them.

269
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,360
The more they are like this,

270
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,640
the more serious I think the situation is.

271
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,440
I think you should

272
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
make decisions by yourself.

273
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,800
Well,

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm so torn.

275
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,800
Why did you laugh? It's frightening.

276
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,680
Ah? Ah.

277
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,720
Nothing.

278
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,480
A joke just came to my mind.

279
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,440
A fat man

280
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
fell from the 20th floor.

281
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,320
What would he look like?

282
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,040
Chubby Dango.

283
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
Goodbye. Friend.

284
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,280
Nannan, it's time for a meal.

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,840
OK.

286
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,800
Come and enjoy your meal.

287
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,720
You ran out last night.

288
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,280
Your mother and I are very concerned.

289
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,720
From now on,

290
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
You can't be so capricious.

291
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,080
If

292
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,880
The start-up you mentioned.

293
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Your mom and I

294
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,680
discussed about it.

295
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,760
We think

296
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
it is not impossible.

297
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,920
You mean...

298
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,920
But I must state

299
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
the requirements clearly.

300
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,280
First of all,

301
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,600
The venture capital

302
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,200
is risky.

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,280
The investment return ratio

304
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
for the first two years

305
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,760
was a loss.

306
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
So your mother and I

307
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,200
can only bear

308
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,000
your entrepreneurial risk for two years.

309
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
If your career hasn't improved

310
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,480
in two years,

311
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,160
we'll give it up.

312
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,880
Dad

313
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,960
Secondly,

314
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
No matter what happens in the future,

315
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,480
we can discuss it nicely.

316
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,520
You can't just run out.

317
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,880
Thirdly.

318
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,760
Thirdly.

319
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,600
Have dinner.

320
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,680
Yes.

321
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Let's eat.

322
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,760
Eat more.

323
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,880
Your dad cooked them

324
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,760
specially for you.

325
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,400
Thank you, mom and dad.

326
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,480
The soy sauce added

327
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
is bought by you.

328
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,760
Mom, I'm ready.

329
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,560
Let's go.

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,760
Take less specialties.

331
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,600
You took too many specialties last time.

332
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,760
My roommates dislike them.

333
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,760
Come out.

334
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,120
Mom.

335
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,600
Mommy.

336
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,880
Your father and I

337
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,520
will play mahjong in your third aunt's house.

338
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
Take a taxi to the station yourself.

339
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,840
Take care.

340
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,200
That I asked you to leave me alone

341
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,320
doesn't mean you don't need to care about anything.

342
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,320
You just gave me 100 RMB.

343
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
It costs 150 to the station.

344
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,480
Shall I get off halfway and go by myself?

345
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,440
What a miser!

346
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,720
Xiaoyu

347
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,840
Xiaoyu, what are you doing here?

348
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,960
Hello, uncle and aunt.

349
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,240
Your mom didn't see you off?

350
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,320
No. I'm taking a taxi

351
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,520
to go to the railway station myself.

352
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,880
Come with us.

353
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,240
We're just going to see off Nannan.

354
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,360
Come on. Get in the car.

355
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,720
Get in the car.

356
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,680
Thank you, aunt.

357
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,360
Thank you, uncle.

358
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,440
Nannan

359
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
After arriving in the university,

360
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,840
remember to take out

361
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,600
the quilt first.

362
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,720
It's full of flavor after a holiday.

363
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
Recently,

364
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,000
it is still cold.

365
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,560
do remember to put on more clothes.

366
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
You can't eat cold food.

367
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,920
She still treats you as if you were a child.

368
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,240
Ah,

369
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,160
Xiaoyu

370
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,560
Yes.

371
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,160
I heard that your mom said that

372
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,280
you are also a member of the debate team.

373
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,760
Are you on the same debate team

374
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,480
with our Nannan?

375
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,480
I...

376
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
I joined a debate team, too.

377
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
But we're not on the same team.

378
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,440
She's on the school team.

379
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm in another team.

380
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,560
Oh, that's all right.

381
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

382
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,080
Do you have any plan

383
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,120
for your recent internship?

384
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,240
Aunt, I'm only a sophomore.

385
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,600
Ah.

386
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,400
Well, your aunt's memory didn't serve well.

387
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,280
Oh.

388
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,600
Are you

389
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,920
preparing for TEM-8?

390
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,480
It's pretty difficult to pass.

391
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Get ready for it.

392
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,160
I

393
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,560
just passed TEM-4.

394
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh.

395
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,760
I didn't mean it this time.

396
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,200
They are for you.

397
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,080
That's all?

398
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
I went to see you

399
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,920
all night by bus

400
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,520
in my pajamas.

401
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I missed you, too.

402
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,560
Wow.

403
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,360
I didn't expect your affection

404
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,120
to be stronger after the Spring Festival.

405
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,560
You are more handsome.

406
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,520
It's for you.

407
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:09,960
Thanks.

408
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,120
What about mine?

409
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,040
Oh.

410
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
50 yuan, thanks.

411
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,240
Was your cola

412
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,720
drunk by a big star?

413
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,960
Why is it so expensive?

414
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,720
Isn't your dear son's

415
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,120
cost of meals for half a month

416
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,000
money?

417
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,480
All right, you two go on.

418
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,960
I'll go to the back kitchen and get ready.

419
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,160
It will open soon.

420
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,880
The group sent a message.

421
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,160
This debate perfectly explains

422
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,000
what is the harmony of time, place and people.

423
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,920
We are people who have experienced

424
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,600
family psychological defense war.

425
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,880
We will surely win.

426
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,800
Nan Bei

427
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,040
I think

428
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,920
maybe

429
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
we should be honest with others.

430
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,360
Don't you also say that

431
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,760
if we break up

432
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,720
it will be bad for the debate team?

433
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,920
Did you figure it out?

434
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
The main reason is that

435
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
the bad result can hardly happen.

436
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm sorry

437
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,040
for keeping a lid on this for a long time.

438
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,240
We are in love.

439
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,480
Oh.

440
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
What's your reaction?

441
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,160
We didn't lie to you.

442
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,280
We are really in a relationship.

443
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,600
It's true.

444
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,320
Ah.

445
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,600
So what?

446
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,440
Xiaoyu

447
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,080
Do you know that

448
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,840
there is a feeling

449
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,920
that

450
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,680
you really want to get something

451
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,920
and suddenly one day

452
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,040
you finally get it,

453
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,600
but in your heart there will always be a sense of...

454
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,560
I get it.

455
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,400
emptiness?

456
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,880
Ma Nan

457
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,400
Why don't you say something?

458
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
Aren't you two always together?

459
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,480
Who told you we've been in love?

460
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,800
I thought you two

461
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,680
had been a couple.

462
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,600
Forget it.

463
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
Sorry, I'm late.

464
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,760
What happened?

465
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,360
Why is the atmosphere so dignified?

466
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,760
Nan Bei said

467
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Xiaoyu and he are together.

468
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,680
Oh.

469
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,720
Ah！

470
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
Ah!

471
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,880
Well, what do you mean that they are together?

472
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,560
You mean they are in love?

473
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
Then how could you be so

474
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,560
calm?

475
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,360
We can...

476
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,840
Let's look at the files.

477
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,360
OK?

478
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,320
Come on.

479
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,240
Well, we...

480
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Our rivals this time

481
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,920
are from Donggang Jiao Tong University.

482
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,920
They are super good. We should treat them seriously.

483
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,800
And the competition system

484
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,760
has changed a lot.

485
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,760
First of all, in the process of competition system,

486
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,640
the traditional arguments, refutations and rebuttals

487
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,120
are cancelled,

488
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,480
and changed into two debaters vs. two debaters.

489
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,120
They can choose respectively

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,040
speech

491
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,120
or refutations.

492
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,800
If we choose refutations,

493
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,360
they will select

494
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,560
any debater

495
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,680
to accept our refutations.

496
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,920
In that case, we could

497
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,120
give it a try in advance

498
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,920
to see what they've got.

499
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
You stupid boy.

500
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,080
They must

501
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,280
send the strongest to take the move.

502
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,480
If so,

503
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,160
isn't it easy for us

504
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,720
to lose this part?

505
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,160
It makes sense.

506
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,600
You hit the nail on the head.

507
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,640
Besides,

508
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
if we choose refutations,

509
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,920
in the three minutes of this round,

510
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,680
we have to share

511
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,400
with our opponents.

512
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,240
and are faced with

513
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,640
the uncertainties brought by our opponents.

514
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,960
So I suggest

515
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,000
that we collectively choose arguments

516
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,640
and give up refutations.

517
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,040
And throughout history,

518
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,840
few teams choose

519
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,600
refutations

520
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,280
rather than arguments.

521
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,600
The biggest change

522
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,400
in this debate

523
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,640
is the audience voting system.

524
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,840
In each round,

525
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,920
audience will vote as judges.

526
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,000
The voting percentage will be displayed in real time.

527
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,640
At the end of each round,

528
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,000
the data will be locked.

529
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,400
So how can we count as winning?

530
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,000
Finally, they will calculate the total number of votes.

531
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,920
Is that clear?

532
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,800
In other words,

533
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,840
No matter which team

534
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,280
wins in any round of the debate

535
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,760
from the beginning to the end,

536
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
if it lags behind

537
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,360
in the audience's vote,

538
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
it will still lose the game.

539
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,720
If so,

540
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,400
it leaves us a lot of tactical space.

541
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,280
Exactly.

542
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,200
However,

543
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,960
it's not very reliable

544
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,280
to give the audience the right to score.

545
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,920
This is an eternal argument.

546
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,600
Whether the debate should

547
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,120
conquer the opponent

548
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,080
or the audience.

549
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
Or neither,

550
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,320
but pursue

551
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,560
the depth of thought of the debate.

552
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,160
But if you pursue depth,

553
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,880
it will definitely be impossible

554
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,960
to leave it to the audience,

555
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,280
because the audience's attention

556
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,840
is easily get distracted,

557
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,000
which will make the debater

558
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,600
focus on

559
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,800
attracting the audience,

560
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,040
and it is difficult to have depth.

561
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,440
I think it's not that serious.

562
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,640
This can

563
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
market the debate game.

564
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,280
At least the audience would love to listen.

565
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,280
I don't have such a big pursuit.

566
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,720
I care nothing as long as I can win.

567
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,560
You got it.

568
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,640
Comrades,

569
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,160
anyway,

570
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,680
there is no choice

571
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,600
for us in this competition.

572
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,240
We must

573
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,440
dance in shackles.

574
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,040
I hope everyone can do their best.

575
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,640
The debate is a three-person system.

576
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,000
I've already discussed with Hao.

577
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,640
Nan Bei, Xiaoyu and Dango,

578
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,600
you will be participating.

579
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
No, no, no.

580
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,920
I haven't figured out

581
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
how to communicate with my dad.

582
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,200
Hao will be better.

583
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,400
Hao, what do you think?

584
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,640
No problem.

585
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,080
Excellent! Enough talk.

586
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,040
Boys and girls, let's practice.

587
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,520
The relaxed feeling

588
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,640
for not having to appear on the stage is so...

589
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,840
Welcome everyone to

590
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,000
Qingguan Cup Debate Tournament,

591
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
also the site of today's League

592
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
Points Match in the provincial level.

593
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,400
On my right is

594
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,160
today's affirmative side,

595
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
the debate team from Donggang Jiaotong University,

596
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,680
who won regional championships

597
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,920
for three consecutive years.

598
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,920
Today, their position is

599
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,840
in family relationships,

600
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,080
being yourself is more important.

601
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,520
Let's welcome them.

602
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,000
Tough.

603
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,760
A hard nut to crack.

604
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,120
Change another shop next time.

605
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,720
It is too hard.

606
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Be grateful that I bought it for you.

607
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,760
Eat it.

608
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,520
The opposing side that challenged them

609
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,280
was the debate team 235,

610
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,160
a dark horse

611
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,280
that flourished

612
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,320
in a series of games.

613
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,640
Let's give them

614
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,440
applause, too.

615
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,440
In this competition,

616
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,840
we adopt the new system

617
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,680
of the 2020 Industrial Cup.

618
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't worry. I'll watch your back.

619
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,080
Be in command of yourself.

620
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,840
Don't cause troubles.

621
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,800
The result of this competition

622
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
is decided by the on-site audience

623
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,040
voting together.

624
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,200
Each audience can change votes for three times.

625
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,480
Please

626
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,040
use your rights carefully

627
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,240
and make responsible choices.

628
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,520
Now I declare

629
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,440
the competition officially started.

630
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,320
Now let's invite the first positive speaker

631
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,240
to speak first.

632
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Do you prefer a speech or a refutation?

633
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,560
We choose speech.

634
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
As expected.

635
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,280
Let's welcome them to state arguments.

636
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,720
Thank you, chairman.

637
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,960
Greetings to all of you present,

638
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,560
firstly, I'd like to ask a question to everyone.

639
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,280
In our country,

640
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,560
How many family relationships

641
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,400
do we have

642
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,680
including grandparents,

643
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,760
parents,

644
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
brothers or sisters?

645
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,080
I am my parents' daughter,

646
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,760
my paternal grandfather's granddaughter,

647
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,040
my maternal grandfather's granddaughter,

648
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,480
my younger brother's elder sister,

649
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,720
my father is also my grandfather's

650
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,320
son,

651
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,040
my mother's husband,

652
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
and my maternal grandmother's son-in-law.

653
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,520
And

654
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,640
Actually,

655
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,080
one equation

656
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,560
for the number of family relationships

657
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,600
is that the number of family relationships

658
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,280
equals the total number of people minus one divided by two.

659
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,320
In this way,

660
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,440
in an ordinary family,

661
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,640
there are 28

662
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,800
different family relationships.

663
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,440
You are a father

664
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,840
also a son, a husband and a son-in-law.

665
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,800
You are a son,

666
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,920
also an elder or younger brother,

667
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
a paternal or maternal grandson.

668
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,360
Do you know why

669
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,880
in such a complicated family relationship

670
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
we still feel comfortable

671
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,000
and don't seem

672
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,680
to be in trouble?

673
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,760
It's because

674
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,320
behind all decisions

675
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,400
is yourself.

676
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,000
You just have to be yourself

677
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,480
and being yourself

678
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,360
is the cornerstone

679
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,880
of all healthy relationships in our view.

680
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,960
It is not easy

681
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,440
to be yourself

682
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,600
and play

683
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,560
28 different roles.

684
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,200
Throughout the history,

685
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,200
killing brother or father, betrayed by relatives.

686
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Which family tragedy

687
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,760
was not caused by

688
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,880
the dislocation

689
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,040
or lack of family identity?

690
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,480
Do you think I would

691
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
be drunk every day?

692
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,520
Isn't it for the family?

693
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,200
Do you think

694
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,640
I'm still willing to be with you?

695
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,400
It's for the family.

696
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,760
The sentence "It's for

697
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,200
this family"

698
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,280
using moral kidnapping

699
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,560
has pushed many family relationships

700
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,160
to pieces

701
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,440
and total collapse.

702
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,520
On the other hand, those happy families

703
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,720
who have kind fathers and filial sons with good brotherhood,

704
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,840
which one can realize

705
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,360
the unity and harmony of the family

706
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,640
without

707
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,760
fulfilling their own duties?

708
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I hope that we will put aside

709
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,320
the pretense that it's for the family.

710
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,800
Instead, shoulder family responsibilities,

711
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,120
and be ourselves.

712
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,880
Stop

713
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,720
hurting the family in the name of love.

714
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,560
Thank you.

715
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,840
What the hell? What's her routine?

716
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,280
I know she must be wrong

717
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,840
but I can't figure out

718
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,440
what's wrong.

719
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,560
Calm down. It's a piece of cake.

720
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
Hao, defeat her.

721
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,160
Now

722
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,680
let's give the floor to the first negative speaker.

723
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,680
Do you prefer

724
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,840
a speech or a refutation?

725
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,680
Speech.

726
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,640
Please.

727
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,520
Thanks, chairman.

728
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,040
Hello, everyone.

729
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,600
Just now my fellow debater argued that

730
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,680
the family relationship was too complicated

731
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,280
for me to cope with,

732
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,840
so I had to be myself.

733
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,080
The argument given by her

734
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,960
is called the number of family relations.

735
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,240
The formula is simple and clear,

736
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,000
but the number

737
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,760
has neither temperature

738
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,480
nor meaning.

739
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,600
Of course, I can't be

740
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,240
grandpa's daughter.

741
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,480
Neither can I be father's wife.

742
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,440
But can't I take care of them

743
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,480
for grandpa and dad?

744
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Empathy is not a substitute.

745
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,960
Putting yourself in the position is not a copy.

746
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,600
Are family relationships

747
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,440
really that complicated?

748
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,760
Your mother gave birth to you

749
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,160
after 10 months.

750
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,960
Your father

751
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,160
worked hard for you and even quit smoking and drinking.

752
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,440
What I actually see is

753
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,480
simple and straightforward love.

754
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,960
What's so complicated about it?

755
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,800
Even as my fellow debater said that

756
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,360
you have 28 family relationships,

757
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,920
isn't it

758
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,720
28 love?

759
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,160
Throughout the ages,

760
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,200
whoever kills brothers and fathers

761
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,440
is not a lonely person?

762
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,480
Whoever is betrayed by their relatives

763
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,240
is not

764
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,080
for their own self-interest?

765
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,200
So where is

766
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
the problem?

767
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,560
Our team believes that

768
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
it's precisely because

769
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,840
they are too concerned

770
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,400
about being themselves.

771
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,960
My fellow debater said

772
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,960
Families who consist of kind fathers and filial sons with good brotherhood

773
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,640
are a model of family harmony.

774
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,440
But the correct reading should be

775
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,920
that father is kind to son and son is filial to father

776
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,080
with brothers love and respect each other.

777
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Fathers care for children.

778
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,280
Children care about their father.

779
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,080
Older brothers care for younger brothers

780
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,840
and the vice versa.

781
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
This is the family we desire,

782
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,640
isn't it?

783
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,480
The crow feeds parents. The lamb kneels down to suckle.

784
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,520
This is the truth

785
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,800
that all things in nature know.

786
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
Family affection makes altruism,

787
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,480
which seems not in line

788
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,600
with natural selection

789
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,200
become

790
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,880
the most powerful link

791
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,720
to firmly maintain family relations.

792
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,000
We believe that in family relations,

793
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,200
being a family member is more important than being yourself.

794
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
Because only when you think of them

795
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,640
and act for them from your heart,

796
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,840
can we be called a family.

797
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:32,880
Thank you.

798
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
Fight fire with fire.

799
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,440
Speech combined with the rhetorical question.

800
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,440
How awesome Hao is!

801
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,760
I didn't expect

802
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,280
Hao to be able to take advantage of emotions.

803
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,080
I almost gave my heart to her.

804
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,080
She did move the audience.

805
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,720
But the rational argument of the speech

806
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,360
was sacrificed for the real-time audience.

807
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,000
What are you afraid of?

808
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,240
There are no professional judges in this competition.

809
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,480
My fellow debater said that

810
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,720
for the family is a kind of altruism.

811
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,240
Must altruism be good

812
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,320
in family relationships?

813
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,480
Not necessarily.

814
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,480
Everyone has read

815
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,320
The Gift of the Magi.

816
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,960
The husband sold his watch

817
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
to buy a comb for his wife.

818
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,480
The wife cut her hair

819
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,400
to buy a watchband for her husband.

820
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,520
This is certainly

821
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,320
a beautiful relationship.

822
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,040
But is it because of the beauty

823
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,880
of this relationship

824
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,560
that makes it

825
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,600
an immortal masterpiece?

826
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,360
No.

827
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,400
It's because of

828
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,680
the bitterness of this relationship.

829
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,800
The root of the bitterness

830
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,600
of this relationship

831
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,640
is that they both forgot that

832
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,400
being themselves

833
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,680
is the cornerstone of a relationship.

834
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,160
The relationship between our people

835
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,400
is like a line between two points.

836
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,440
Is it necessary

837
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,080
to have my point first

838
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
so that this line can be connected?

839
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,880
If all of us are like

840
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
this couple

841
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,040
and lose our points,

842
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
what we end up with

843
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
is a comb without hair

844
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,600
or a strap without a watch.

845
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,520
We always say it's for your own good.

846
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,280
But in most cases,

847
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,520
we do things from our point of view.

848
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,680
We often

849
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,160
cook a dish

850
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,800
just because of the child's comment

851
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,040
"Oh, it's so delicious"

852
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,600
to keep cooking the same dish.

853
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,520
I like

854
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,320
James Cameron.

855
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,960
My girlfriend

856
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,640
saved up living expenses

857
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,240
to buy me the Collector's Edition of Terminator,

858
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,920
but what I like

859
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,680
is Avatar.

860
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,720
Then the worst thing is that

861
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,880
I have to watch the Terminator

862
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,560
with her.

863
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,880
So everybody,

864
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,480
why don't we admit that

865
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,800
no one can fully understand

866
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,680
another person?

867
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,120
Even if you are his wife,

868
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,960
husband, parents or children,

869
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,600
you can't.

870
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,200
So if we can't,

871
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,160
why can't we

872
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,000
be ourselves?

873
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,240
There are not many major disputes

874
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,640
in the family relationship,

875
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,440
but trivial matters

876
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,240
that the spoon

877
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,080
will definitely touch the edge of the pot.

878
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,960
Be yourself.

879
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,800
Fully express your demands.

880
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,320
Keep the diversity in family relations.

881
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,280
Seek common ground while reserving differences.

882
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,480
So that these problems and contradictions

883
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,920
will not make a big mistake

884
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,480
because they are hard

885
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,360
to say and dare not do.

886
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
Do we have to sacrifice

887
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,360
our most precious things

888
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,240
for an unwanted gift

889
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,040
from each other?

890
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,840
Don't do that.

891
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,600
It's more important to be yourself. Thank you.

892
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,920
The competition is a bit fierce.

893
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,320
Oh, crumbs! The speech prepared by Xiaoyu

894
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,440
is completely inconsistent with his point of view.

895
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
Next is the time for

896
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,360
the second negative speaker.

897
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,560
Will the second negative speaker

898
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,200
choose speech or refutations?

899
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,320
Xiaoyu

900
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,120
Xiaoyu

901
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,120
Xiaoyu

902
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,520
Will the second negative speaker...

903
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,720
I choose refutations.

904
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,120
Why is it different from what was agreed?

905
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,080
You have only three minutes in this part.

906
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,840
The effect of refutations

907
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,800
is certainly not as good as that of speeches.

908
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,240
What the hell is she thinking?

909
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,280
Trust her. She knows what she is doing.

910
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,600
You know nothing. Stop eating.

911
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,440
Now let's welcome

912
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,040
the second negative speaker

913
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,200
to question

914
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,920
any positive speaker.

915
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,360
Time is three minutes.

916
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,800
Hello, my fellow debater.

917
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,320
Hello.

918
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,440
You just said that

919
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,800
because everyone is different,

920
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,960
we have no clue about

921
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,400
what is really good for others.

922
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,720
Is that true?

923
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,200
Yes.

924
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
But shouldn't my family be

925
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,680
the one who knows me best?

926
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,400
My favorite food is

927
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,240
my mother's egg fried rice.

928
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,120
She knows that.

929
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,680
Why do you have to say

930
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,560
she doesn't know?

931
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,480
How does your mother know

932
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,200
you love egg fried rice?

933
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Is it because you

934
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,400
chose to be yourself

935
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,320
and expressed your affection

936
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,440
so that she could know?

937
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,960
So in your definition,

938
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,280
being yourself is to be honest.

939
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,160
Acting for the family must be

940
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,000
insincerity?

941
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,680
It's not what I mean.

942
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,120
My point is that

943
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,440
it is a more authentic choice

944
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,320
to be yourself

945
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,800
when there is conflict between you and your family.

946
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,160
My father likes chicken legs very much.

947
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,040
But he always

948
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,920
chooses to give them to me.

949
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,080
Is this for himself

950
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,920
or for me?

951
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,920
It's for you.

952
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,640
That's why he lost...

953
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,480
But isn't the choice from

954
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,320
his true heart?

955
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Is his choice

956
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,960
hypocritical?

957
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,920
Let's take a step back.

958
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,160
My fellow debater, you're right.

959
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,680
But I'm afraid many more important things

960
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,480
are not as simple

961
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,080
as you think.

962
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,960
For example, to be pushed to get married.

963
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,360
Should I be faithful to myself

964
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,320
or rush to close life events

965
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,040
for the peace

966
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,080
of my parents?

967
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,360
Under this competition system,

968
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,400
rhetorical questioning is not foul.

969
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
They want to use rhetorical questions to control the tempo.

970
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,640
Xiaoyu won't bite.

971
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,720
She'll ask back.

972
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
Why do parents push you to get married?

973
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,520
Maybe because your parents

974
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,280
are eager to hold a grandson.

975
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,480
You mean being urged to give birth to a baby.

976
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,360
My fellow debater,

977
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,240
you are so naive.

978
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,760
They are like peas and carrots.

979
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Just two steps.

980
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,440
Getting married and having children is a joy in life.

981
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,680
Parents hope you will be happy as soon as possible.

982
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,560
Is that wrong?

983
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,520
Parents want me

984
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
to be happy so they urge me to get married.

985
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,200
But this

986
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,120
becomes the most unfortunate thing

987
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
in my life.

988
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,120
My fellow debater, in my opinion,

989
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,880
it perfectly explains

990
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,360
why it's better to be yourself for others.

991
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
This guy has really got something.

992
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,360
Where is the key to the problem?

993
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,400
Is it caused by your parents

994
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,120
for your sake?

995
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,320
They just want

996
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,120
you to have hot meal to eat

997
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,880
clean clothes to wear

998
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,680
and someone to take care of you

999
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,920
when you are sick.

1000
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,240
Is that a problem?

1001
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,520
But you don't want to get married.

1002
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,000
That's the problem.

1003
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
So as long as there are different views,

1004
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,160
there will be problems, right?

1005
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,920
Isn't it a fact?

1006
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,800
So the state of harmony but difference

1007
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,400
does not exist?

1008
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,240
Harmony but different

1009
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,320
is of course the most ideal state.

1010
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,680
But don't the problems arise in the family relationship

1011
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,960
when people in a family

1012
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,200
hold different views?

1013
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,920
No.

1014
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,360
The difference is not terrible.

1015
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
the terrible thing is the inability

1016
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,480
to understand the differences in family members.

1017
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,640
It is due to incomprehension

1018
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,520
that the family relationship

1019
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,440
has problems.

1020
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,560
Is it the most important thing

1021
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,520
to be yourself at this time?

1022
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,280
Even so,

1023
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
isn't it more important

1024
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,280
to be yourself

1025
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,200
as the cornerstone of all healthy relationships?

1026
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,080
The importance of the foundation

1027
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,640
was just refuted

1028
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,440
by the first speaker on our side.

1029
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,520
What is your more important

1030
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,200
criterion for judgment?

1031
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,080
It's the foundation.

1032
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,560
What is

1033
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,760
your standard?

1034
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Being yourself or for the family

1035
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,040
which is more conducive to problem-solving,

1036
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,880
is more important.

1037
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,800
Therefore, my fellow debater,

1038
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,360
it is more conducive

1039
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,240
to solve the problem by being yourself.

1040
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,920
Acting for the family

1041
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,080
is called evasion problem.

1042
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,960
Very good.

1043
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,800
So, my fellow debater,

1044
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,800
do you agree with

1045
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,880
our criterion for judgment?

1046
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,760
Thank you.

1047
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,200
We did not win this round.

1048
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,640
I thought there would be no problem.

1049
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,520
Relax.

1050
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,520
Although we suffered

1051
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,200
a small loss in this round,

1052
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,120
we took a big advantage.

1053
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,240
Although it was a small win on the scene,

1054
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,520
it was more difficult

1055
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,000
because the opponent had taken over

1056
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,520
the judgment standard and comparative consensus.

1057
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,040
We have set standards

1058
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,680
on this round of refutation,

1059
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,000
giving us more confident

1060
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,720
in the free debate.

1061
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,240
And the result of the debate

1062
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,600
is calculated by

1063
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,680
adding the votes of all rounds.

1064
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,360
The victory or defeat of a single round is not vital.

1065
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,000
So the final result

1066
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,520
depends on the free debate.

1067
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,240
If the other party abandons the essential discussion

1068
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,280
and only talks about the methodology

1069
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,840
of solving family problems,

1070
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,800
it will only make us

1071
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,640
lose more battlefields.

1072
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,960
We must turn the table around.

1073
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,400
Make use of the existing advantages

1074
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,080
to seize the battlefield of methodology

1075
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,600
and destroy their arguments.

1076
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,040
Xiaoyu

1077
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,200
Now, it's the time for

1078
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,280
the free debate.

1079
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,520
The two sides speak alternately,

1080
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,080
four minutes for each side.

1081
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
Start from the affirmative side, please. 

1082
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,400
If you have a

1083
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,200
domestic violence husband,

1084
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,360
should you stand up bravely

1085
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,120
and be yourself,

1086
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,680
or not resist

1087
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,560
for the so-called harmony?

1088
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,480
Everyone, remember

1089
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,480
that when you encounter domestic violence,

1090
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,600
call the police, get divorced

1091
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,480
and divide your property.

1092
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,360
This wave of processes

1093
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,320
is the biggest responsibility for you and your family.

1094
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,640
On the contrary, doesn't this husband's

1095
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,200
domestic violence

1096
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
justify the horror of being only for himself

1097
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,320
and not for his family?

1098
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,000
If a person's personality is irritable

1099
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,640
and stubborn,

1100
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,760
would you still think that

1101
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,240
being himself

1102
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,400
is good for family relations?

1103
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,360
According to what you said,

1104
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,520
is it better for family relations

1105
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,040
if he has a gentle nature

1106
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
to be himself?

1107
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,080
Are there more good people

1108
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,760
or more bad people?

1109
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,920
Are you questioning being yourself

1110
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,080
or discriminating against character defects?

1111
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
For the phenomenon of people who help brothers at no cost,

1112
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,440
is it a disadvantage for the family?

1113
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,600
It is originated from

1114
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,280
a deformed

1115
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
family relationship and cognition.

1116
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,480
Don't evade problems.

1117
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,400
Please answer me directly.

1118
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,840
Does it count as a disadvantage?

1119
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,720
I don't think so.

1120
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,880
Why?

1121
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,120
How can the women who are known as

1122
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,720
helping brothers at no cost

1123
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,320
betraying

1124
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,480
her and her husband's small family

1125
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,000
be regarded as family members?

1126
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,960
Xiaoyu is really good at jumping out of the circle.

1127
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,400
Because she is unreasonable.

1128
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
The phenomenon

1129
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,960
is due to the abnormal values

1130
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,560
caused by long-term family environment

1131
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,440
and family education,

1132
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,520
rather than simply being yourself,

1133
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,960
or the choice made for the family.

1134
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,640
Essentially,

1135
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,320
son preference

1136
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,200
is the culprit.

1137
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,000
In 2013,

1138
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,920
An old father in Jiangxi

1139
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,840
tightened his belt and bled himself white

1140
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,360
in order to marry a daughter-in-law

1141
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,520
for his son.

1142
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,480
As a result, he

1143
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,840
was abused by his son.

1144
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
If he was willing to be himself,

1145
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,960
would such a tragedy

1146
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,080
not happen?

1147
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,160
It is human nature

1148
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,120
to consider for children.

1149
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,880
You don't blame

1150
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,640
the greedy son,

1151
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,320
but blame

1152
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,400
a father who worked hard for the child.

1153
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,480
Won't your heart hurt?

1154
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,080
Is it a kind of compromise and tolerance

1155
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,600
to do things for the family?

1156
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,040
Wrong.

1157
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,640
Acting for the family is an attitude,

1158
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,360
not necessarily

1159
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,080
a very specific behavior.

1160
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,960
So your side

1161
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,480
just think about the family

1162
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
from your heart.

1163
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,600
What you behave

1164
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,480
is very honest to be yourself.

1165
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,840
They are in a standoff.

1166
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,280
Almost at the same level.

1167
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,360
It's good for us.

1168
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,760
Our emphasis on acting for the family

1169
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,520
is a way

1170
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,400
to empathize and promote

1171
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
communication and exchanges.

1172
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,080
An old couple,

1173
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,360
the husband likes to eat fish head

1174
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,600
and the wife likes to eat fish tail.

1175
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,400
They both give

1176
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,160
each other

1177
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,640
their favorite part

1178
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,560
for each other.

1179
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,920
As a result, no one can eat

1180
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,120
the part they like.

1181
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,040
They do things for the family.

1182
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,080
Why didn't they promote communication?

1183
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,000
Instead, they wasted each other's hearts

1184
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,320
in silence.

1185
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,080
My fellow debater,

1186
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,160
This is a love story.

1187
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,200
Don't you think it's warm?

1188
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,600
If they only care about

1189
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,160
themselves,

1190
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,640
will such

1191
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,440
a touching love story

1192
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,440
still exist?

1193
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,000
There are also many love stories,

1194
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
all of which can be deeply moving.

1195
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,960
But if blind dedication

1196
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,040
is advertised as a love story,

1197
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,000
is it the biggest misunderstanding

1198
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,920
of true love?

1199
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,760
Do you mean

1200
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,840
to exchange a lifetime love

1201
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,120
by not eating fish head for a lifetime?

1202
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,040
Yes, I do.

1203
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,440
After all, true love is hard to get.

1204
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,120
Although I can't eat fish head,

1205
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,600
I can still eat

1206
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,400
hot pot, barbecue, ice cream,

1207
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,840
right?

1208
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,160
I do, too.

1209
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,360
Is this a public display of affection?

1210
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,920
You will get used to it.

1211
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,800
I'm in my 30s.

1212
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,960
Ten years ago, my dad didn't let me buy Bitcoin

1213
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,240
for my own sake.

1214
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,160
He insisted that they were all liars,

1215
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
so financial freedom

1216
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,240
passed me by.

1217
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,360
Why did you harm your family

1218
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,480
for the sake of your family?

1219
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
It happened that ten years ago,

1220
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,920
when I was in middle school,

1221
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,440
I wanted to start a business and open a shop.

1222
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,520
I didn't listen to anyone who tried to persuade me

1223
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,600
and I lost everything.

1224
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,200
Why is it so miserable

1225
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,920
to be yourself?

1226
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,920
If you don't be yourself first,

1227
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,240
I eat whatever you prepared

1228
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,440
and do whatever you like.

1229
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
In the seemingly peaceful situation,

1230
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,040
my family members can't hear my heartfelt wishes.

1231
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,880
How can they be

1232
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,960
truly good for me?

1233
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,280
I think you can

1234
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,000
be yourself first.

1235
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,240
So being yourself

1236
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,120
is a prerequisite for your family,

1237
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,520
right?

1238
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,320
Is the prerequisite more important?

1239
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,080
My fellow debater,

1240
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,800
don't you remember

1241
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,600
the criterion

1242
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,520
we just confirmed?

1243
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,400
I feel like Xiaoyu

1244
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,600
was pushed back to the standard line again.

1245
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,360
Almost. Keep on attacking.

1246
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,960
We need to find a breakthrough.

1247
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
to pull the topic back

1248
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,960
to the core issue.

1249
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,440
Mommy's boys

1250
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,720
think about moms' feelings all the time.

1251
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Are they good men?

1252
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,720
I think mommy's boys

1253
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,800
are not thinking about moms.

1254
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,400
They just believe

1255
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,440
what their moms said is right.

1256
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,120
Their moms, it's impossible for their moms

1257
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,960
to be right all the time.

1258
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,880
He thinks his mother is always right.

1259
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,120
Isn't that a problem?

1260
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,200
Yes, it is.

1261
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,640
So I have never agreed

1262
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,960
behaviors of mommy's boys are right.

1263
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,480
On the contrary, let sons

1264
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,920
live the way they like.

1265
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,880
Is this for their sons?

1266
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,680
This is simply satisfying themselves.

1267
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,360
Don't worry. I'm not.

1268
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,200
Scram!

1269
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,040
I wanted to apply for literature

1270
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,920
in a college application form.

1271
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,120
But my parents asked me to study finance.

1272
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,040
Should I give up my dream

1273
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,480
for the sake of my parents?

1274
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,280
In that case,

1275
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,240
your parents should

1276
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,000
respect your wishes.

1277
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Be more considerate of your family.

1278
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,480
The more you communicate, the better you understand.

1279
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,160
When family members conflict with

1280
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,040
their own wishes,

1281
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,320
if you act for the family,

1282
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,040
shouldn't you follow

1283
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,000
the family's wishes?

1284
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,880
Not necessarily.

1285
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,640
My fellow debater,

1286
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,320
this is not necessarily.

1287
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,080
That is not necessarily.

1288
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,720
What is more important?

1289
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,840
In this example,

1290
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,880
whether it is you or your parents,

1291
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,920
if you think more about your family,

1292
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
conflicts will not arise.

1293
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
Similarly, whether it is you or your parents,

1294
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,600
conflicts are inevitable

1295
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,120
if everyone is just about to

1296
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
be themselves.

1297
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,400
Doesn't this suggest that

1298
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,320
it is more important to act for your family?

1299
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,040
On the other hand,

1300
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,840
does a good family relationship

1301
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,160
have fewer conflicts, the better?

1302
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,200
Does avoiding conflict

1303
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,400
necessarily benefit family relationships?

1304
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,360
Sometimes bickering

1305
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,000
is also a kind of

1306
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
family fun.

1307
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,040
So more conflicts

1308
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,480
is

1309
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,080
a sign of good family relations?

1310
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,440
Well done!

1311
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,160
When the weather gets cold,

1312
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,080
should I wear thermals

1313
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,720
for my mother?

1314
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,360
Does it count as a family relationship?

1315
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,280
Doesn't it count?

1316
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,520
Fine, it does.

1317
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,800
Wearing thermals is a way for your mother

1318
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,040
to express her concern for you.

1319
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,200
But you just went against your parents

1320
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,480
in order to be yourself,

1321
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,080
wasting the kindness.

1322
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,480
Treat concern as a contradiction.

1323
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,520
A good family relationship

1324
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,840
has become a total mess.

1325
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
Don't you think it a pity?

1326
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,040
Whenever we list

1327
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,240
the drawbacks of acting for the family,

1328
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,920
they will say that

1329
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,680
it is an unhealthy family relationship,

1330
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
instead of the family's fault.

1331
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,880
So I would like to ask

1332
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,440
how to define acting for the family?

1333
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,080
That's it.

1334
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,200
I think they should be compromise and tolerance.

1335
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,320
What is the essence

1336
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,280
of being yourself?

1337
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,560
Principles and persistence.

1338
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,480
Therefore, what we really need

1339
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,240
to discuss today

1340
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,680
is based on the following two consensus.

1341
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,920
In an intimate relationship

1342
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,360
like a family,

1343
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,400
which one is more important,

1344
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,360
compromise or persistence?

1345
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:40,920
Right?

1346
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,520
I think you are right.

1347
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,680
He admitted it.

1348
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,280
Don't worry. He knows what he is doing.

1349
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,720
Next

1350
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,920
is the final round

1351
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,800
of this competition.

1352
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,880
Summary statement.

1353
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,680
Three and a half minutes for each team.

1354
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,600
Start from the negative side, please.

1355
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,200
Thank you, chairman.

1356
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,800
Hello, everyone.

1357
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,400
I think the affirmative side

1358
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,840
is right.

1359
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,640
The topic we are discussing today

1360
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,760
is to discuss

1361
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
which one is more important

1362
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,240
in the close relationship like a family,

1363
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,440
compromise or persistence?

1364
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
But we don't seem to

1365
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,800
figure out one issue.

1366
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,720
What are we compromising?

1367
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,400
And what are we insisting on?

1368
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
My fellow debater would definitely say

1369
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,360
we insist on being ourselves.

1370
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:28,640
We insist on independence

1371
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,520
and that our personalities are not disturbed.

1372
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,760
However,

1373
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,640
does our family relationship

1374
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,320
really get better

1375
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,080
when we go out

1376
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,960
to study?

1377
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,360
Think it over,

1378
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,720
who called to whom

1379
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,960
the last time we talked to our parents?

1380
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,480
The most chat records with our parents,

1381
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:43,920
are they

1382
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,320
transfer records?

1383
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,440
We talk increasingly less

1384
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,880
with our parents.

1385
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,400
The parents have also turned

1386
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,680
the most irresistible order

1387
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,320
into

1388
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,800
a cautious inquiry.

1389
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,880
Is this really what we want?

1390
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,360
No.

1391
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,240
It shouldn't be.

1392
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,440
Haven't our parents

1393
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,280
been young?

1394
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,000
Haven't our parents

1395
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,160
been youthful?

1396
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,000
They also got a perm,

1397
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,720
wearing flared trousers

1398
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,600
carried with radios

1399
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,280
dreaming to be a singer

1400
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,040
to form a bank

1401
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,080
and to realize their dreams.

1402
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
What made them wear shirts

1403
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,200
with cropped hairs

1404
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,480
living a life line points day after day?

1405
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:23,880
It's me.

1406
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,680
It's us.

1407
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,120
It's every family member.

1408
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,040
Once after he was drunk

1409
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,680
I asked

1410
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,280
my dad

1411
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,480
do you regret

1412
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,320
giving up your dream

1413
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,280
for me?

1414
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,680
At that time,

1415
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,720
I always thought that music

1416
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,000
was the most important thing in my life.

1417
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,960
But afterwards I found out that

1418
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,680
you are the most precious part in my life.

1419
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,000
So

1420
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,760
I shaved my hair,

1421
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,040
sold the guitar

1422
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,080
and make money for your milk powder.

1423
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,480
Dad

1424
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,680
Do you regret it?

1425
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,760
Do you regret

1426
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,360
being my son?

1427
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,040
He smiled and asked me back.

1428
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,080
Do you regret being my son?

1429
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,680
I was taken aback at the time

1430
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,360
and I raised my eyes to see the family portrait.

1431
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Grandparents spend their twilight years in peace.

1432
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,400
My parents worked hand in hand for most of their lives.

1433
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,200
All my family members

1434
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,120
are safe and sound.

1435
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,400
No one answered the question

1436
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,360
that day.

1437
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,240
But I'll never forget

1438
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,040
that night in my whole life.

1439
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,000
We do not advocate

1440
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,360
sacrificing ourselves

1441
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,320
when the family conflicts.

1442
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,880
But can we

1443
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,560
think more about the feelings of our family

1444
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,880
when we are dealing with

1445
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,840
the most important relationship in life?

1446
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
To understand

1447
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,520
their situation more

1448
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,360
because one day

1449
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,200
we

1450
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,760
will become them.

1451
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,200
Thank you.

1452
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,400
What to eat? What to eat?

1453
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,480
We must have

1454
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,360
a delicious meal this time.

1455
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,720
If this continues like this

1456
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,360
I don't know

1457
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,160
whether I should hope you win

1458
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,040
or not.

1459
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:31,840
Ah.

1460
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,240
I'll follow you.

1461
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:33,880
Hey,

1462
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,560
Stop your public display of affection.

1463
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,440
This is called a double harvest of career and love.

1464
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,040
OK?

1465
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,320
Xiaoyu

1466
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,520
Gong Chen

1467
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,480
Gong Chen

1468
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,520
Who is he?

1469
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,320
He was Xiaoyu's Prince Charming in the high school.
