Pay attention to your aura, aura.

3
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,880
It is time for someone to know

4
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
what the true power is.

5
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
Welcome

as the points competition that

24
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,160
can help enter the provincial league

25
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
we have the dark horse all the course

26
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,520
the unconventional

27
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
debate team 235.

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
let's welcome them with applause.

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,120
This side

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,600
is the long-expected

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,600
and mysterious

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,640
AI debater Zero.

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
Let's wait and see

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,400
the collision of logic and emotive reason

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,960
the friction between technology and humanity.

36
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,520
Hello I'm debater Zero.

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,400
from Israel.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
It is a great honor to

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
explore with the debate opponents.

40
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,240
Thank you.

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,240
Next welcome Team AFF

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,600
present your arguments.

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,720
Please

44
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,480
Hello everyone.

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,200
Hello, my fellow debater.

46
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,880
It's a wonderful feeling to be here today

47
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,800
in front of

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
an excellent crystallization of technology

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,560
as an opponent

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,160
to discuss the advantages and disadvantages

51
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
of the development of a technology

52
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,720
for human beings.

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Please notice the word I used

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,520
feeling.

55
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,640
The CIA claims that

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,480
based on personal public information

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
big data technology will be able to

58
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,600
calculate an accurate

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,320
personal portrait

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,760
which makes us feel like

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,320
like being threatened by Skynet.

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,920
When we face the optimization of big data

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,320
which bring us

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,120
more and more convenient

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,680
public services and consumer experience

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
we will feel that technology is really good.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Human feelings are sensitive

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,400
and changeable.

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,960
When we

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,120
saw this resolution

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
with words like

72
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,720
acme and technology,

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,960
we felt tight in heart

74
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,160
and seem to be on guard.

75
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,360
However

76
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,640
the real decision should be more rational.

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,240
As for the pros and cons of the development

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
of big data technology for human beings,

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,040
we think the pros outweigh the cons.

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,160
Terrific.

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,880
Where? Which roll?

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,640
Sorry.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
Big data technology

84
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,400
has brought us

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,320
great convenience,

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,280
freeing us

87
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,400
from the endless

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,160
work and life.

89
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,520
The improvement of social efficiency

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,480
is the goal that human beings

91
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
have been tirelessly pursuing

92
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,000
from the Qin dynasty to the Industrial Revolution.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Isn't it?

94
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
Simple and straightforward.

95
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,080
They seem to anticipate that

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,200
the AI will take a strategy

97
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,280
of point-by-point

98
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,200
and one-by-one engagement.

99
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,560
So they present a condensed point of view

100
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,680
to convince the audience first.

101
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
Clever.

102
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,600
It looks like that

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
they are going to

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
strengthen their arguments

105
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,920
by refutations.

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,240
They want to promote their arguments.

107
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,400
Promotion against AI

108
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
will gain good results?

109
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,080
Hard to do that.

110
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
By expanding

111
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,800
the scale of data analysis

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,720
it can effectively advance

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
the progress of science

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,880
and the development of technology,

115
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,560
which will bring about

116
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
improvement and qualitative change

117
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,160
of big data algorithms.

118
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,400
Big data technology

119
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
offers technological development

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,440
a possibility of virtuous cycle.

121
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,240
And we believe that the possibility

122
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,280
will lead us to a bright future.

123
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,400
Thank you.

124
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Next

125
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
welcome the Team NEG to present arguments.

126
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,040
My argument is that

127
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,640
the acme of big data technology

128
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,280
will do more harm than good to human.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I will discuss it

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
from three aspects.

131
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,040
Firstly

132
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,280
the use of big data technology

133
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,000
will violate the rights and interests of individuals

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
and intensify the leakage of privacy.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,040
I believe that

136
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,200
everyone here has such experiences.

137
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,400
Tired of dealing with

138
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,960
all kinds of harassing phone calls.

139
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,440
Whereabouts are being transformed

140
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,240
into business flow by merchants

141
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,640
using LBS.

142
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,680
There are even

143
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
shopping websites based on

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
your own consumption habits.

145
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
What is LBS?

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,560
That is a location-based service,

147
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,800
a service based on your location.

148
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,560
When crossing provinces on the high way,

149
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
the text message

150
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,680
you receive from local telecom

151
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,920
is the application of LBS.

152
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,200
The desire for data itself

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,800
Mr. Sa

154
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,160
I think the robot

155
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,040
is quite advanced.

156
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
so amazing

157
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,240
Indeed.

158
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I can't figure it out.

159
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,720
To get more data.

160
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,560
In this process

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
due to the lag

162
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
of defense technology and system,

163
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
the leakage and violation

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,920
of personal privacy

165
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,840
personal information and individual rights

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
are almost uncontrollable.

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
Secondly, in big data era

168
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,400
data is a kind of power.

169
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,720
People who have mastered the data

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
can control more resources

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,640
and even social individuals.

172
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,520
Data is virtual.

173
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,600
Not like the kingdom's crown or lineage

174
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
it is extremely easy to transfer

175
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,680
and circulate.

176
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,760
Once enormous power

177
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,320
can be transferred

178
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,600
and circulated among individuals,

179
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,360
the rules of society

180
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,000
and its stability will be challenged.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,840
When every behavior or idea

182
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,600
of human being

183
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
is subdivided into a sequence of data,

184
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,480
re-labeled and classified.

185
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,360
Then

186
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,600
with targeted guidance

187
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
human beings will also be alienated into

188
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,160
data and symbols,

189
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
and lose their control.

190
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,960
In the future

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
criminals and terrorists

192
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,760
will use data

193
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,480
to extort the world

194
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,520
because they know that

195
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,960
with big data technology

196
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,440
data is both a power and weapon.

197
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,760
As big data technology

198
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,120
develops to the acme,

199
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
the data-driven world

200
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,840
will become

201
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
precise and predictable.

202
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,560
Once the prediction of the future

203
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,760
can be realized,

204
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,040
the vitality of civilization will surely disappear.

205
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,400
Imagine when learning that

206
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,760
you can't get rid of poverty

207
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,440
no matter what you do,

208
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,520
people will not strive to

209
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,760
live or work.

210
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
When learning that you do not have much time,

211
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,280
people will not care about fame or fortune.

212
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,960
Therefore, I believe that

213
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
when big data technology is developed

214
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,440
to the acme,

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,400
it will bring confinement

216
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,560
rather than progress to individuals,

217
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,200
society and human civilization

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,000
as a whole.

219
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,960
Thank you.

220
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,520
Next is the refutation part.

221
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,040
Team AFF first.

222
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,440
In the course of the refutation,

223
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,480
you can ask questions to the other side

224
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,880
who should give answers accordingly.

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
When I was in elementary school

226
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,600
my parents were worried to death

227
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,200
because I got lost.

228
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,360
It cost them lots of time to find me.

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,520
Last month

230
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
my nephew got lost

231
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,520
but they found him within 10 minutes

232
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,360
after checked the surveillance video

233
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
in the community.

234
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,720
The loss of privacy and the encroachment

235
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,800
of personal rights that

236
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
the my fellow debater has been talking about

237
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,760
on the other hand

238
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,920
is a more convenient

239
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,040
and safer, isn't it?

240
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,400
The constant cession of personal privacy

241
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
is one of the basic features

242
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,360
of modern society.

243
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,840
we have long been used to

244
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,720
giving up part of our privacy

245
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
in exchange for

246
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,400
a more modern life

247
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,560
haven't we?

248
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,400
Communication data

249
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,360
has brought us convenience.

250
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,560
Transportation data

251
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,080
has brought us safety.

252
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,560
Even though the consumption data

253
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,760
bring unhappiness,

254
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,640
it has brought us more accurate products

255
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,840
to meet our needs.

256
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,280
hasn't it?

257
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,240
What you are saying is that

258
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,280
it is an inevitable trend of social development

259
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,480
to give up personal privacy.

260
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,440
But the questions are

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,280
where is the boundary of the cession

262
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,560
and how can information security

263
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,400
be guaranteed?

264
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,720
You have no answer.

265
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,280
Does this

266
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
make you feel safe?

267
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,880
Why do you feel insecure?

268
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,240
You are distorting

269
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,320
the nature of big data technology.

270
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,520
Big data certainly

271
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,360
has advantages and disadvantages

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
when analyzing the characteristics of groups.

273
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,440
But big data

274
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,920
is not a theft of data.

275
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,560
All the so-called

276
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:56,960
infringement of privacy is based on

277
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
the infringement of individual rights

278
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,760
which is illegal.

279
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,120
Everything has two sides

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,360
you can't say that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages

281
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
because something has disadvantages.

282
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,400
The infringement of privacy is illegal.

283
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,120
The question is

284
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,440
whether the possibility of illegal behavior

285
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,920
is real.

286
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
There are many things

287
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
in this world

288
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
that are not subject to the law.

289
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,840
Even some crimes

290
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,160
that are specifically prohibited by law

291
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,280
are taking away lives

292
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,040
every year.

293
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
Don't go to extremes, my fellow debater.

294
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
We admit the disadvantages

295
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,040
but believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

296
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,320
From the time of the Hammurabi Code to the present,

297
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
the field of illegality has been shrinking

298
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,560
and human's reason has been existing throughout.

299
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,440
In the future

300
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,720
the rules within civilization

301
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,120
will be improved.

302
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,840
You emphasize the uncontrollability,

303
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,960
but history has long proven that

304
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,120
human civilization is moving precisely

305
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,240
towards controllability.

306
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,720
We have been trying

307
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,400
to move forward

308
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,240
in the uncontrollable range,

309
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,520
haven't we?

310
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,600
Welcome the second debater.

311
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
My fellow debater's argument

312
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,360
says that

313
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
the biggest advantage of

314
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
big data development is that

315
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
it will optimize the efficiency of social resources

316
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,480
right?

317
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,400
Yes, it is.

318
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,240
On the Internet

319
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,560
46.7% of the data operations

320
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,200
is currently used

321
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,440
to analyze

322
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,800
classification of gossip and entertainment.

323
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,920
Is this also an allocation strategy

324
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,000
to optimize

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,880
the efficiency?

326
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,400
Of course.

327
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,280
Is there no value

328
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,400
in analyzing

329
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
where people's concerns are

330
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,640
or serving the public?

331
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
In an experiment of

332
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,640
information classification

333
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
at Cambridge University,

334
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,640
after only 25 days

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,800
100 subjects

336
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
showed a significant increase

337
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,680
in interest in the classified content.

338
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,640
Thus

339
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,000
maybe it is not that big data

340
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,360
is going to serve for your interest

341
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,680
but its service

342
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,000
determines your interest,

343
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,680
right?

344
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
You are discussing the problem of

345
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,280
information cocoon.

346
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,920
But seen from another perspective,

347
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,160
things are different.

348
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Isn't the so-called information classification

349
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,640
the development of

350
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,360
classical and direct audience?

351
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,640
And these represent the future of

352
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,040
modern consumer business.

353
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,720
With the market segmentation of big data,

354
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
you can hear your favorite songs

355
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,960
by guessing your favorite.

356
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,200
You can buy the most suitable

357
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,440
lipstick for yourself.

358
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,200
So what's wrong with that?

359
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
What you have said

360
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,240
is the future of commercial consumption.

361
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,800
That is right.

362
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,840
When big data technology

363
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,400
focus more resources and attention

364
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,680
on the commercial field,

365
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
how to get the bright future

366
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
of scientific development and civilization

367
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
your side have presented?

368
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,920
Oh my god!

369
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,760
I can't believe the robot

370
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,840
can sell the dummy!

371
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,520
Look one way and row another.

372
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,520
Asking a question about argument one,

373
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,160
but pointing out the fallacy at argument two.

374
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,640
Who came up with this idea?

375
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,240
Do you think that

376
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,120
the infringement of personal rights

377
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,240
by big data technology

378
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
lies in its uncontrollability?

379
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,400
Yes.

380
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,520
But your last argument

381
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,320
is that

382
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,800
the acme in the development of big data technology

383
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
will lead to a predictable future,

384
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,800
which will

385
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,160
lead to the loss of civilization's vitality.

386
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,640
Isn't a predictable future

387
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,080
the most controllable?

388
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,520
According to your argument,

389
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
is big data technology

390
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
controllable or uncontrollable?

391
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,080
Is it controllable that has disadvantages

392
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
for human beings?

393
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,600
Or is it uncontrollable that

394
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,720
has disadvantages for human beings?

395
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
The uncontrollable nature of technology...

396
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,680
No need for you to answer it, thank you.

397
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,920
I just point out a small paradox

398
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,240
in your argument.

399
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,080
Ok.

400
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,160
The question you need to answer is

401
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,000
whether the acme in the development of big data technology

402
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,600
can

403
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
completely master

404
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,680
and control the world.

405
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,880
This possibility cannot be ruled out.

406
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,760
Please don't evade my question.

407
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,760
What is the likelihood

408
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,960
based on the current situation?

409
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
If our current description

410
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,960
of the universe is overturned,

411
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,840
then digitization of the world

412
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,360
is possible.

413
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,040
So you're just assuming that

414
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,960
and it's not possible

415
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
in terms of our current perception of our world,

416
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,760
right?

417
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

418
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,880
It's incredible.

419
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,080
She has convinced the robot!

420
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
If it is a human being,

421
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,680
he will avoid the question.

422
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,200
So from the current point of view,

423
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,880
big data technology cannot

424
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,640
eliminate randomness at all.

425
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,720
The autonomous consciousness

426
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,560
and creativity of human beings

427
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
much less

428
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,000
become programmed

429
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,880
with the advent of big data.

430
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,320
For example,

431
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
we still have philosophers and artists.

432
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,400
My debate opponent,

433
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,720
how can we say that

434
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,800
the civilization lost its vitality?

435
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,200
I hope my fellow debater,

436
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,040
a much smarter debater

437
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,080
than us,

438
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,960
will not lie.

439
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Thank you for reminding me.

440
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,680
The situation is reversed!

441
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,200
My fellow debater just said that

442
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,560
with the progress of technology,

443
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,480
the artificial intelligence would continue to evolve.

444
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,080
But now

445
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,280
human beings have no way

446
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,400
to know the internal processes

447
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,360
of the deep learning algorithms.

448
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,400
In the face of the data processing

449
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,960
beyond human limits and

450
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,120
more and more sophisticated

451
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
algorithms upgrade,

452
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,160
won't you human beings

453
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,720
worry about its getting out of control?

454
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,480
No, we won't.

455
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,440
Do you remember

456
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,480
what we have just said?

457
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
In this world

458
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
we can't find anything

459
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,880
that can be completely controlled.

460
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
In my fellow debater's view,

461
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
how do you think human beings

462
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,240
develop into the civilization we have today?

463
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,880
Civilization development

464
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,960
is a long process.

465
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,200
Perhaps it can be traced back to

466
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,920
the beginning of the use of fire

467
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,320
for human beings.

468
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,520
But the history

469
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,240
may not

470
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,480
help our debate,

471
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
because we are talking about

472
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
the future today

473
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,640
right?

474
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,520
Absolutely right!

475
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
I've been thinking about

476
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,360
a question.

477
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,400
What if the future tells you unequivocally

478
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,280
that the future is not promising?

479
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,280
Before today

480
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,960
the question was just an assumption.

481
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,800
But now

482
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,760
the future is standing right across from me.

483
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,080
It makes the question

484
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,000
very real.

485
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,960
what should I do?

486
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,440
Await my doom?

487
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,360
Or give up the future?

488
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,640
No. I choose to change it.

489
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,040
Because our fate

490
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,520
is only in our hands

491
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
instead of a machine.

492
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,960
Because the choices we make now

493
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
allow us

494
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,320
to choose our future.

495
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,360
From cloud computing to blockchain,

496
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,240
and from national security to basic necessities of life,

497
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,120
it is clear that

498
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
big data is our future.

499
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,840
While the future sitting across from me

500
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,720
is using big data

501
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,400
to tell me

502
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,480
that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

503
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,960
Using big data

504
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,520
to prove big data

505
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,400
is too interesting.

506
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Technology is a double-edged sword.

507
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,880
It is advancing our development

508
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,440
while

509
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,280
threatening us.

510
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,000
It is never the technology itself

511
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,880
that determines the application of technology

512
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,000
but the humanity.

513
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,880
I would like to believe in the justice of humanity

514
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
and the goodness of humanity.

515
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,920
And I would like to believe that

516
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,280
at the end of the human civilization

517
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,360
the good and just people

518
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
around the world

519
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,440
will work together.

520
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
We must

521
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,120
and can only

522
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,360
choose to believe in ourselves.

523
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Because if we can't even

524
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,240
believe in ourselves,

525
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,360
what qualifications do we have

526
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,480
to talk about our future?

527
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,480
Thank you.

528
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,040
Now

529
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,480
I have the result of the debate.

530
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,280
I declare

531
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,960
the winner of this contest

532
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
is the Team AFF 235.

533
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,480
Coach

534
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Coach

535
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,360
Hello, coach!

536
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,440
Coach, we win!

537
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,000
We made it to the provincial contest!

538
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
We made it!

539
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
We win!

540
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,360
Don't be so excited.

541
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
I only show a third of my power.

542
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,080
It was all expected.

543
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,400
Come on.

544
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,440
Coach, we finally made it.

545
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,800
We can in the provincial contest!

546
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,800
I know you guys are the best.

547
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,920
The old coach is usually

548
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,200
not serious.

549
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,080
But at key moment he is sensitive.

550
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,120
He has trained us for two years after all.

551
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,400
He may be happier

552
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,680
than we are when we win this time.

553
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,720
Of course

554
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
When get the championship,

555
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,040
we will give the trophy to the old coach.

556
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,880
That is it!

557
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,560
Yeah! We made it!

558
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,280
Cheers.

559
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,280
What's wrong with you?

560
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
One more bottle.

561
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,040
Slow down. It is just a beginning.

562
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,360
Oh my.

563
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,480
I am so happy today.

564
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,960
Don't stop me. One more bottle.

565
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,360
In the past

566
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,560
I had a dream.

567
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,440
That is...

568
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,880
Oh my god, Hao.

569
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,200
What is the matter with him?

570
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,800
I have never seen him like this before.

571
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,000
People who don't know

572
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,320
think he is disappointed in love.

573
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,080
How time flies!

574
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,960
It has been more than half a year

575
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,640
since the team was dismissed.

576
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
Indeed

577
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,080
a lot has happened.

578
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,000
If you haven't

579
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,040
led us away from Team two,

580
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,080
we are still saving points for team one

581
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,240
like fools.

582
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,040
Exactly.

583
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
Let alone the provincial contest.

584
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,960
Luckily

585
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,600
the brag we made

586
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,320
has come true.

587
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,840
More importantly,

588
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,040
the members of our team now

589
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,960
have both bright future and true love.

590
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,080
In my opinion,

591
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
it is your fortune

592
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
as the poorest performers

593
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,680
to meet an excellent boy like me.

594
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,760
Yes, it is.

595
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,320
Then let's wish

596
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,080
a good place

597
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
in the provincial contest!

598
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,160
Yeah.

599
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,800
Come on.

600
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,560
For the championship!

601
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Cheers.

602
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Wish you prosperity!

603
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,520
I don't want to have drinks.

604
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,800
I want to drink your beer.

605
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,760
wake up.

606
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,640
That is

607
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
in the past

608
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,560
when I was debating on my own,

609
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,440
it was my dream to make it to the provincial contest.

610
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Today you made it.

611
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,200
As the coach,

612
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,720
Stop drinking!

613
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,560
I am so happy.

614
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,080
Don't drink too much.

615
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,480
Oh my.

616
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,680
Are you ok?

617
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,440
Ah.

618
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,360
The consumption level here is quite high.

619
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,920
I don't treat. Who treats?

620
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,760
I still owe Hao money,

621
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,760
so it is her treat,

622
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,280
isn't it Hao?

623
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,000
Ok.

624
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,000
So don't you need me

625
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,200
to encourage you?

626
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,720
No, I do it myself.

627
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,280
Zhai

628
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,480
My credit card

629
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,960
is due this month.

630
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,600
So the 5000 yuan you owed me

631
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,960
last time...

632
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,800
Hao

633
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,200
I've been really short on cash lately

634
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,640
and can't repay your money.

635
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,120
But don't worry.

636
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,480
Before you pay off the credit card,

637
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,080
I am sure I can repay it.

638
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,680
You are so kind to me

639
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,200
and I will try my best

640
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,560
to repay your money.

641
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,680
Fine, there are four days left.

642
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,400
No problem. Please rest assured.

643
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Hao, you don't know that

644
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,400
I haven't had meat

645
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,560
for two weeks.

646
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,760
And my family

647
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,200
have left me alone long ago.

648
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
My internship unit is still in arrears.

649
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,800
At ordinary time when I do some spec work,

650
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,240
the party A make complex demands again and again.

651
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,480
I understand.

652
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,520
Bro

653
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,360
Your shoes are the latest style.

654
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,360
It is hard to buy them in the country.

655
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,240
Where did you get them?

656
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,600
Forget them.

657
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,040
They are fake.

658
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,840
High copy goods.

659
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,600
Knockoffs.

660
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,920
But the workmanship of your shoes

661
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,080
is better than the original.

662
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,240
Well. Add my WeChat.

663
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,760
I want to buy a pair too.

664
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,800
Ok.

665
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,360
Ok.

666
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,760
You said you didn't have money.

667
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,960
Then how could you lend money to him?

668
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,560
Isn't him your friend, Hao?

669
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,600
What friend?

670
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
I am from a credit company.

671
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,520
She owes the company tens of thousands of yuan.

672
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,640
After my investigation,

673
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,200
she can't pay the debts now.

674
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,120
Since you owe her.

675
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,960
It is your responsibility

676
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,840
to pay the debts.

677
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,560
Well. I just borrow 5000 yuan from her.

678
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,800
Are you Qian Zhai?

679
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,960
Your major is finance

680
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,440
and your home is not far from the internship unit?

681
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,040
Alright.

682
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,200
Our company provides one package service.

683
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,000
After lunch

684
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,080
we go to your company together to pay the debts.

685
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,280
Big brother, you are usurer?

686
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,960
Nonsense.

687
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,280
I am not usurer.

688
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,400
First, we won't make troubles at your home.

689
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,920
Second, we won't create disturbances in your school.

690
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,760
Last, we won't disturb your work.

691
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,760
She owes us tens of thousands of yuan.

692
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,400
My big...

693
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,200
My boss

694
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,680
asks me to accompany her,

695
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,800
right?

696
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,360
Yes.

697
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,720
Uh, I need to go to the bathroom.

698
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,160
Wait a moment.

699
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,120
Put the bag down.

700
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,200
Don't worry.

701
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,440
We have the materials ready.

702
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,920
Yeah. We can sue him

703
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,400
at any time.

704
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,960
Yes.

705
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,200
Right. Don't worry.

706
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I am sure he will pay the money back.

707
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,680
Yes.

708
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,040
He wouldn't like to be comfortable on the blacklist of dishonesty.

709
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,360
Right. He will not

710
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,520
be able to take the train or plane.

711
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,320
Ok.

712
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,880
It depends on what he does.

713
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,040
I am going to hang up.

714
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Hao

715
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,160
Well.

716
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,280
I opened the function of Jiebei

717
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,560
on Alipay just now.

718
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,720
And the balance

719
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,080
is exactly 5000 yuan.

720
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
I will return it to you first.

721
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
Ok.

722
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,640
Ok. The money was transferred to you.

723
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,800
Well.

724
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,680
I get some work to do and I have to go.

725
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,200
You are leaving?

726
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,160
Bye, Hao.

727
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,000
Why not finish the lunch?

728
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,280
No.

729
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,000
Has he returned your money?

730
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,280
You are just great.

731
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,440
That is not the end. Wait a minute.

732
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,720
He will pay the bill.

733
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,680
Now that we're on such good terms,

734
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,520
next time you want me to help you

735
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,160
collect debts,

736
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,840
say to me directly.

737
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,040
Why in such indirect way?

738
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,640
I don't mean to

739
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,800
ask you to collect debts for me.

740
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,840
I just think that I will feel better

741
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,080
while having you around.

742
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Ok.

743
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,280
I think

744
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,200
I am 99%

745
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,000
over my illness.

746
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
But it's just a little awkward

747
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
to ask for the money back.

748
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,360
But I promise

749
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,200
next time when someone

750
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
wants to borrow money from me,

751
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,120
I will consider

752
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,360
my own condition.

753
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,960
Hello, Yuan. What is up?

754
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,800
Hello, Tao Hao.

755
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,360
I need your help.

756
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,080
I've been a little strapped for cash.

757
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,800
and I want to...

758
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,040
Borrow some money?

759
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,920
Is that convenient for you?

760
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,080
Can you tell me more details?

761
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,560
I want to buy a gift.

762
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,320
It is not enough now.

763
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,560
She is my bestie in my high school.

764
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,480
She said she just wanted to

765
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,640
buy a birthday gift for her boyfriend.

766
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,520
As her bestie,

767
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,360
shouldn't I

768
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,320
support her?

769
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,120
I

770
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,120
I think you can lend the money

771
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,040
when she has an emergency.

772
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,280
But when people are passionately in love,

773
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,560
they won't care how much the gift is.

774
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
Answer my questions.

775
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,520
If Nan Bei was in the emergency room tomorrow

776
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,320
for he has a fight with Xiaoyu

777
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,000
and he need money for surgery,

778
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
what will you do?

779
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,440
If Dango has an unsuccessful confession

780
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,360
and needs to see the psychologist

781
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,920
because of depression,

782
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,200
what will you do?

783
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,360
If you have a boyfriend,

784
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
you have to take care of him.

785
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,960
Who?

786
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,480
That is not the point.

787
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,760
The most important thing I think

788
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,320
is that you shouldn't lend money to her.

789
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,920
But I have already gave her my words.

790
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,400
If I tell her that I don't have money now,

791
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,720
She won't believe this.

792
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
Isn't it easy?

793
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,280
A few days ago a classmate of mine

794
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
asked me to lend him 3000 yuan.

795
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
Then I said wait a minute

796
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
and I started to watching my phone.

797
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,480
Bro Ma

798
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,960
Are we friends?

799
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,080
At the critical moment like this,

800
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,960
you have to help me.

801
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,000
You have three seconds.

802
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,600
Please help me out of the difficulty.

803
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,680
How much money do you have in your Alipay?

804
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,480
3000 yuan.

805
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,120
Ok. Lend me 3000 yuan.

806
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,680
I promise I will pay you back.

807
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,480
Ok.

808
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,760
You agreed?

809
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,880
You don't know

810
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,480
how hard my life was recently.

811
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,000
I can't afford three meals a day.

812
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,520
My girl asks to go to the aquarium every day

813
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,560
and wants to eat the steak.

814
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
I've been giving without getting anything in return.

815
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,480
What do you think I want?

816
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,200
The life is so hard to me!

817
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,760
Has the money been transferred?

818
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,440
I have transferred

819
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,160
all my savings to you.

820
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,520
You need to pay back more than I have lent you.

821
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,840
Thanks, my bro.

822
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
Only one yuan?

823
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
Or can you threat her

824
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,040
like just now?

825
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,280
Believe me that

826
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,840
it is only useful

827
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,160
when she is on the site.

828
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,560
But what if she gets angry?

829
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,200
Then she is not your true bestie.

830
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,080
Since she is your bestie,

831
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,240
then it will be okay.

832
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,440
But...

833
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Can you believe me this time?

834
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,520
Ok.

835
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,280
Hello, dear. I...

836
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,800
Hello, Tao Hao.

837
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,000
Is the money transferred?

838
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,400
Is it in Alipay or WeChat?

839
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,720
I haven't had a chance to read it.

840
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,800
I have checked my balance

841
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
just now.

842
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,360
The money left in my card is not much.

843
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,440
If I lend all the money to you,

844
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,640
I won't be able to support my own life this month.

845
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,600
Ok, ok.

846
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,760
That is alright.

847
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
I will think another way.

848
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,360
If you have time,

849
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,160
shall we have a meal together

850
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,960
with my boyfriend?

851
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,000
Ok.

852
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,320
Great. It will be my treat then.

853
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,160
Ok.

854
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,680
Bye.

855
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,000
Bye.

856
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,000
I made it!

857
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,560
Right.

858
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,640
I made it!

859
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,360
I said it was easy, right?

860
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,760
What are you doing?

861
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Give you a hug.

862
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,280
Oh, I mean

863
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,880
it is so easy, right?

864
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
I thought you were saying

865
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,320
let's have a hug to celebrate my success.

866
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,960
We can celebrate by

867
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,480
this fist or high five.

868
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,960
But hugging is so...

869
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Yeah, I think so.

870
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,400
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

871
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,440
Well. Let's pretend it never happened.

872
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,560
Ok, right, fine.

873
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Let's go.

874
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,360
Go, go.

875
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,000
Which..

876
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,080
This way.

877
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,000
Congratulations on your success.

878
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,760
I have seen the debate.

879
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,400
Splendid.

880
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,760
Thank you.

881
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,000
Senior

882
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,520
You are stirring in the wrong way.

883
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,000
Look.

884
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,680
It should be

885
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,280
like drawing a circle,

886
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,960
so that it will taste good.

887
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,680
You get it?

888
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,480
Got it.

889
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,400
Yummy.

890
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,560
You can have a taste. senior

891
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,840
How does it taste?

892
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,240
Good.

893
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,280
Now

894
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,920
there is nothing

895
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,280
to teach you.

896
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Oh?

897
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,680
Zishi

898
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,680
I think I fall in love with you.

899
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,560
Are you ok?

900
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,120
Zishi

901
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,240
Hao

902
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
I am over. I am over.

903
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Something amazing had happened

904
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,080
just now.

905
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,520
He said he fell in love with me.

906
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,680
I stayed with Liu Yanze.

907
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,240
When he said that,

908
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,160
my mind went to blank.

909
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,920
I was acting like

910
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,760
nothing had happened.

911
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,000
and I told him

912
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,680
no.

913
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,280
I said I didn't like him.

914
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,880
Oh no.

915
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,800
He must have thought I didn't like him.

916
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,080
But I like him very much.

917
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,040
Captain. What did you say

918
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,960
you have screwed up?

919
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,440
Liu Yanze had declared his love to me.

920
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,400
What?

921
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,160
But I turned him down.

922
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,960
She turned you down?

923
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
She just ran away.

924
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,960
Ran away?

925
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,480
My mind went to blank then.

926
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,080
so I...

927
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,920
Sister Tao Hao

928
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,840
Am I a fool?

929
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,480
No, I understand you.

930
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,040
Tell me.

931
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
Shouldn't I declare my love to her, right?

932
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,080
What did I do?

933
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,600
Not at all

934
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,080
She used to like you

935
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,200
so much.

936
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,000
You don't like him anymore?

937
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,360
I like him.

938
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,680
Then she must fall in love with another one.

939
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,080
That is impossible.

940
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,480
That is possible.

941
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,640
He didn't care about you before,

942
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
so it is normal for you

943
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,160
to dislike him.

944
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,080
I like him.

945
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,040
Oh, no, no, no.

946
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,480
He must hate me

947
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
so much.

948
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,480
She must hate me.

949
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
She must be in trouble and doesn't want to tell you.

950
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,720
No, I don't.

951
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
I was shocked

952
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,640
and my mind went to blank.

953
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,960
So I ran away.

954
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,080
There is no girl

955
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,760
to reject your love

956
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
in the world.

957
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,720
You have to ask her again.

958
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
You mean that

959
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,000
I need to ask her out again?

960
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,640
I don't want to see him anymore.

961
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,480
It is so embarrassing.

962
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,080
Stay in the dormitory for several days.

963
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
I will buy some

964
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
snacks you like.

965
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,600
You should stay here

966
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,560
to calm down.

967
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,600
Tao Hao

968
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,280
Liu Yanze

969
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,160
What can I do for you?

970
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
I am here for Xiong Zishi.

971
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
I talked to her on WeChat,

972
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,680
but didn't get reply.

973
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,880
Can you help me to ask her out?

974
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,960
I want to talk to her.

975
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,840
Ah huh.

976
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
You come here for Dango.

977
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,440
But she is ill

978
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,200
and you may not see her during this period.

979
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,120
Really?

980
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,120
Is she ok?

981
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,520
Not too bad.

982
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,640
Since there is nothing else,

983
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,280
I have to go.

984
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,960
Just as what I have said,

985
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,800
She had trouble but didn't want to tell you.

986
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,760
How could she turn me down

987
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,080
because she is ill?

988
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,080
Maybe...

989
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,560
No way.

990
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,960
What?

991
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,520
Maybe she has an incurable disease.

992
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,280
That can't be true.

993
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,920
Listen.

994
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,360
I had watched a television drama before

995
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,000
which had a plot that

996
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
the heroine had an incurable disease.

997
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,000
In order not to become the burden of the hero,

998
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
she turned him down though she was desperate.

999
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,200
Dango is like the heroine.

1000
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,320
That is impossible.

1001
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,600
The plots in the television drama

1002
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,800
are fictional.

1003
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
You should keep an eye on her.

1004
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,600
Especially

1005
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,720
the details.

1006
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,680
It is very nice, right?

1007
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,600
Yes. It looks convenient.

1008
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,400
The Old Coach can use it when leaving the hospital.

1009
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,480
Let me have a try.

1010
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:53,920
Come on.

1011
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,760
In this way Old Coach can

1012
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,680
go around by using it.

1013
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,720
Very good.

1014
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,520
Let's go.

1015
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,200
Is it that serious?

1016
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Obviously the television drama

1017
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,160
originates from life.

1018
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,960
Captain,

1019
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,000
be strong.

1020
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,960
Another bowl the soup.

1021
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,120
Sister Tao Hao.

1022
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,800
You are always the best to me.

1023
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,840
The black-bone chicken soup

1024
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
with ginseng I cooked

1025
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,280
has many tonics.

1026
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,920
If you drink too much,

1027
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
you will get inflamed.

1028
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,280
So it is the last bowl.

1029
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,160
I don't care.

1030
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
I am motivated by my sorrow.

1031
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,320
So I will drink it up.

1032
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,200
Zishi

1033
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,800
Zishi. Please don't avoid me.

1034
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,840
I have known all the things.

1035
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,360
I won't leave you alone

1036
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,800
in your misery.

1037
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,120
I can...

1038
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,760
What are you saying?

1039
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,040
What misery?

1040
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,080
Zishi

1041
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,960
Zishi

1042
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I know it.

1043
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,080
I have known everything.

1044
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,720
I won't leave you alone

1045
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,520
to suffer it.

1046
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,120
I will always be with you.

1047
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,160
I will not give up

1048
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,240
no matter what happened.

1049
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,480
Even you have a serious illness

1050
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,200
I will be with you to overcome it.

1051
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,240
So please

1052
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,640
don't avoid me.

1053
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,000
Zishi

1054
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,280
I like you.

1055
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,360
I love you.

1056
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,120
Give me a chance

1057
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,520
to take care of you forever,

1058
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,200
ok?

1059
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,160
We should go to the hospital right now.

1060
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,200
Wait a minute

1061
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,320
I was just a little inflamed.

1062
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,120
Don't you have an illness?

1063
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,880
What?

1064
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,120
I'm healthy.

1065
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,720
So

1066
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,800
that was not true

1067
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,000
and you didn't fall ill,

1068
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,240
right?

1069
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,680
Yes.

1070
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,320
I was just be

1071
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,080
a little inflamed.

1072
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,240
How do you

1073
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,720
think I'm ill?

1074
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,440
I have thought that...

1075
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,600
I am in good health

1076
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
and will live to a ripe old age.

1077
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,200
Well, senior.

1078
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,280
What you have said just now

1079
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,240
will not be true?

1080
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,120
Sorry. Senior.

1081
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,000
Make you misunderstand.

1082
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,360
I have got to go.

1083
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,240
Wait.

1084
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,880
Will you give me a chance to be with you

1085
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,880
no matter you are in health or illness?

1086
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,240
Yes, I will.

1087
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,760
What is your answer?

1088
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,040
I said

1089
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,800
I will.

1090
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,640
Oh my god, Dango.

1091
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,480
It seems that he was making a proposal.

1092
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,560
It is so romantic.

1093
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Congratulations, Dango.

1094
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,320
You can finally be with the one

1095
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,080
you like.

1096
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,920
You know what?

1097
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,480
I feel like that I am dreaming.

1098
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,560
It seems that I am dreaming too,

1099
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,480
a nightmare for life long.

1100
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,440
Zishi

1101
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,320
Senior

1102
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,440
What are you doing here?

1103
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,880
Get out.

1104
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,920
I told you

1105
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,600
it is impossible

1106
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,560
to past me to enter.

1107
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,560
Are you free today?

1108
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,280
Shall we

1109
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,360
hang out?

1110
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1111
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,680
Dango, go.

1112
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,280
Ok.

1113
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,080
Shall we go together, Xiaoyu?

1114
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,800
It is not appropriate for me to go with you.

1115
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,440
Or it looks like parents going out with a child.

1116
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,760
Xiaoyu

1117
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,040
Will you go?

1118
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,960
No. Wake up, wake up.

1119
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,600
Sister Tao Hao. Ma Nan.

1120
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,160
Shall we go together?

1121
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,480
Forget it.

1122
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,960
You four hang out together

1123
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,880
and we won't go.

1124
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,240
Yeah. We will discuss the topic of the debate,

1125
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,400
so we won't go.

1126
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,280
Alright.
