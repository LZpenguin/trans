Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP19

2
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,920
Xiwang!

3
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,080
Let daddy kiss you.

4
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,880
You didn't stay up all night, did you?

5
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
I can think of nothing

6
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,240
but her eyes, her smile,

7
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,800
and my infinite devotion to her.

8
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
In the end,

9
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,840
she still chose to leave.

10
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,480
Let me ask you something.

11
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,160
His name is Gong Chen,

12
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,480
the Prince Charming of Xiaoyu in high school.

13
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,920
Fitness, swimming, or debates,

14
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,680
he excels in any of those.

15
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Besides, he was the winner

16
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,080
of three consecutive debate tournaments,

17
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
and won the title of Best Debater for numerous times.

18
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,680
During high school,

19
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,960
he went to study abroad.

20
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Look, he is capable, good at study,

21
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
handsomeâ€¦

22
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,280
Wait, wait!

23
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,200
What? You don't want to hear it?

24
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,280
Did I ask you about that?

25
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,200
What are you talking about!

26
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,560
Then what do you want?

27
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,600
I mean, your chips have expired.

28
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,280
I just helped you eat more.

29
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,360
Expired?

30
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,600
I think this is a good argument.

31
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,840
Love is essentially a type of relationship.

32
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,480
And all relationships

33
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
require management.

34
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,080
Let me write it down.

35
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,000
It's not right.

36
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
For family members,

37
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,080
is management still required?

38
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Isn't it?

39
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,920
No, it's not.

40
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,480
No matter how much I disobey,

41
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
my father and I, we are still like comrades in arms.

42
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,720
That's because your father

43
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
manages it well for you.

44
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,240
That's because blood is thicker than water.

45
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,200
It doesn't need management.

46
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
As for love,

47
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,320
if it requires no management,

48
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,600
it is true love.

49
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,960
What do you mean?

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
What I mean is,

51
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,600
that in love, we should let nature take its course.

52
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,080
Let nature take its course

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,280
and you just wait to die alone.

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,680
I am talking about the debate topic.

55
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,720
I'm talking about the debate topic, too

56
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
Love dies without management.

57
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,280
That states the topic.

58
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,320
But the topic limits it

59
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,600
to the love of college students.

60
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
More than 95%

61
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,960
of the campus romance

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,680
ended in failure.

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
Is there anything wrong?

64
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,520
Let nature take its course,

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
enjoy the beauty of pure love

66
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
and let it end without a cause.

67
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
That is the mission of a college relationship.

68
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Is there anything wrong?

69
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,760
Yes, there is!

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,120
Xiaoyu!

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,120
Why are you here?

72
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,760
Why is he here?

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Why are you shouting?

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Who's shouting?

75
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,920
What's up?

76
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I gave her the gift as you suggested.

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,920
She really liked it.

78
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,640
She liked it? Then that's good.

79
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,920
Right.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,800
You all knew that, right?

81
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Your opponent in the next match

82
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,120
will be our team.

83
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,200
Nan Bei!

84
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
The next competition

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
is a two-person competition.

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,960
Any volunteers?

87
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,760
Since the topic is about love,

88
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,960
of course,

89
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,480
a couple would be the best.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
You and me, let's go?

91
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,960
Aren't you a dictator?

92
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,320
Just decide it by yourself.

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Let's try it, OK?

94
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Did you ask me for my opinion?

95
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,240
Ah, no, you don't have to.

96
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Why are you talking in such a sarcastic way?

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,040
Why don't you give it a try?

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,880
OK, I'll be the first speaker.

99
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,720
But,

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,280
the rule in this game is the second speaker would do the rebuttal.

101
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,480
Aren't you good at rebuttals?

102
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,520
You'll be the second speaker, OK?

103
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,560
No!

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,320
What again?

105
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
How do you know what I'm good at?

106
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
Don't push it too far, Nan Bei!

107
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm angry now.

108
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,800
Xiaoyu, he is waiting for you to say something sweet.

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm not doing that!

110
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,680
What?

111
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
Groveling is love?

112
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,400
I'd better go broke.

113
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,120
How about you and me form a team?

114
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
You and me? I don't think it's good.

115
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
In terms of tacit cooperation,

116
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Hao and I will make a better team. Don't you think so?

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,880
How long have you been in our group?

118
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,760
It's time for lunch.

119
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,280
How about I invite everyone to lunch?

120
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
No need, Hao.

121
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,680
I have painting class this afternoon.

122
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I have to hurry up.

123
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,880
I'm leaving now, Xiaoyu. Bye.

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,840
As long as you are buying,

125
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,080
I will always be available.

126
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,480
Guys, no one wants to come?

127
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,560
Then we'll leave first.

128
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,720
Do you have time?

129
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,200
Have lunch with me, OK?

130
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,920
Hello!

131
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
What's going on?

132
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,000
I told you to wait for me.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
Why do you come to school?

134
00:08:59,480 --> 00:08:59,840
OK.

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
OK, then I'll come to you.

136
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,160
Who is that?

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,880
He said earlier in the dorm

138
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,760
that his childhood friend would come to visit.

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,520
Childhood friend?

140
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,520
The monitor of his class in primary school.

141
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,320
You know when he was a child,

142
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,840
Nan Bei was naughty.

143
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,000
The teacher then assigned him

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,280
to be the deskmate of the monitor.

145
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
That's how the story went.

146
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,400
The story about a naughty boy

147
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,720
and a straight-A girl

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,840
who helped tutor his homework.

149
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,680
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

150
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,720
You think

151
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,120
why are those two making such a fuss.

152
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,920
They are just bored.

153
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,120
They have no better things to do.

154
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,240
Now you got angry, right?

155
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,160
Now you got upset, right?

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,520
Finally, you knew how I felt

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
when I hated Gong Chen, right?

158
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
Put yourself in my shoes for a moment!

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm sorry, Nan Bei.

160
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
I know I did wrong.

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,960
I'll never do that again.

162
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,680
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,880
Oh.

164
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,640
Give me a feedback after you taste it.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,920
Next weekend,

166
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,360
in the coffee bar near our school,

167
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,000
there will be a Hitchcock film exhibition.

168
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Let's go together?

169
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,640
I'll think about it.

170
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,320
Thank you.

171
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,040
What?

172
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,320
I was thinking about Xiaoyu and Nan Bei.

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,160
Actually,

174
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,240
I quite understand Nan Bei's feelings.

175
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,520
You see, the two of them,

176
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,880
after all the ups and downs,

177
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,120
finally got together.

178
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,920
Suddenly appeared such a person

179
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,720
better than him

180
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
in every aspect,

181
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,680
an ex-Prince Charming.

182
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,720
It's quite normal to feel a little upset.

183
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
I think Nan Bei asked for it.

184
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,400
I thought

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,880
you would be on his side.

186
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,800
Both are young people.

187
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,040
It's quite normal to experience such a period.

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,520
Besides, Xiaoyu is a good girl.

189
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,440
That's true.

190
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,760
But I always feel like

191
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,280
Xiaoyu should

192
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,240
think more about

193
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,160
the feelings of Nan Bei.

194
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,960
Now you are doing it again.

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
You just want to make everyone happy.

196
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,920
Look, the noodle is clumped already.

197
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,360
But I think

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,760
if two people are together,

199
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,880
they should care more about

200
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
each other's feelings.

201
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,760
I think that no matter what,

202
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,280
it should be your own feelings

203
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,000
that are more important.

204
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,200
I think,

205
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,040
still, it's better

206
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,400
to put the other one's feelings first.

207
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,600
Do you think

208
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,280
that two people being together

209
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,640
see many things differently,

210
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,080
would it be a problem?

211
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,240
Not a problem.

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,840
Come on, take a break.

213
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,800
What are you guys doing here?

214
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,960
Ma Nan said,

215
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,240
sports

216
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,240
helped to forget sadness.

217
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,760
Hmm.

218
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,640
Then why don't you go out for a run?

219
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,560
Ma Nan said,

220
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,400
the lion dance

221
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
would stimulate the endorphin of the body.

222
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,760
What kind of nonsense are you spreading here again?

223
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
The endorphin is a hormone in the body,

224
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,560
also known as happiness factor.

225
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,320
When you exercise

226
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,680
to a certain amount,

227
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
the endorphin effect will be generated in the body,

228
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,640
people will feel happy,

229
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,440
and all the unhappiness and stress will be removed.

230
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,920
But

231
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,720
just this amount of exercise

232
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,360
is not enough.

233
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,640
You have already

234
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
implemented your plan, right?

235
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,400
Why are you like this again?

236
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
It does not work on that heartless Xiaoyu.

237
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,520
So what are you going to do?

238
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,080
For love and justice in the world,

239
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,080
I will do some real stuff.

240
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,720
You're not tired of hearing it?

241
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,640
I think this song

242
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,720
is about me.

243
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,400
I read it online before

244
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,720
that when people lose love,

245
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
they hear their own story

246
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,240
from every love song.

247
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,080
I used to feel that's melodramatic.

248
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Now that I see you like this,

249
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,680
it seems to be true.

250
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,280
What are you going to do after this?

251
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,920
I don't know.

252
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,280
She blacklisted me on WeChat,

253
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,360
and also my phone number.

254
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,560
When I went to her dorm today,

255
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,160
I was stopped at the door by her roommates,

256
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,480
and was told

257
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,280
to stop wasting my time.

258
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,360
I can bear all these, really.

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
I just don't understand

260
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,360
why she did this to me.

261
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,160
I buy her drinks when she's thirsty.

262
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,280
I buy her food when she's hungry.

263
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,720
Even in the middle of the night when she said

264
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,640
she wanted to eat watermelon,

265
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,080
I ran ten kilometers

266
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,640
to some

267
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,800
24-hour fruit shop

268
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
to buy it for her.

269
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,360
But look at her.

270
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,640
She said no more contact, and she just cut all the connections.

271
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,280
She said she would leave, and she just left.

272
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,080
Was I not good enough for her?

273
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,520
Everyone would experience

274
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,040
their first relationship.

275
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
She will know how good you are.

276
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,160
And you, what about you?

277
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
What happened between Xiaoyu and you?

278
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,800
Had a quarrel?

10279
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,120
Just need to put us into each other's shoes.

280
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,680
I thought it was normal.

281
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,480
But when Gong Chen

282
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,320
actually showed up in front of me,

283
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,160
I remembered

284
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
that Xiaoyu had a crush on him,

285
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,720
and

286
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,360
he was quite excellent,

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,680
then deep inside,

288
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,240
inexplicably, I felt irritated.

289
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,240
Look,

290
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,680
can we listen to another song?

291
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,480
Are you still bickering with Nan Bei?

10292
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,200
I'll leave him rot.

293
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,040
Strictly speaking,

294
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,840
Nan Bei is your first love, right?

295
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
Not strictly speaking, he still is.

296
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,760
Then try to think like this,

297
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
he was unreasonable and jealous,

298
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,640
but it just proves that he cares about you.

299
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,080
There are so many ways to care.

300
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,840
Why he had to choose

301
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,200
such an annoying way?

302
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,480
You both are in love for the first time.

303
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,480
When expressing emotions,

304
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,880
you inevitably couldn't make it perfect.

305
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,480
Think about it, were there many times

306
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
that you clearly wanted to hug Nan Bei,

307
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,840
but in the end

308
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,360
you ended up beating him?

309
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
As a person who has been there before,

310
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,960
of course,

311
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,800
not quite a successful one,

312
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,920
I still think

313
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,360
that you should go and say something sweet to Nan Bei.

314
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,000
When he feels better,

315
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,320
and gets back his confidence,

316
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
and then you settle things with him.

317
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,400
What do you think?

318
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,640
He's not confident?

319
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,280
He has a low self-esteem now.

320
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,200
I don't think

321
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
he's any worse than Gong Chen.

322
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,480
But he doesn't know

323
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,920
that you think so.

324
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,640
When a person is facing

325
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,200
someone he likes,

326
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,640
it is normal to feel unconfident.

327
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,840
Hao,

328
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
if one's boyfriend is jealous and angry,

329
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,120
what sweet things one should say?

330
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,280
I don't have any experience.

331
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
Are you asking me?

332
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,240
But my experience

333
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,840
is not worthy of reference.

334
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,760
That's right.

335
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,680
What if we two break up?

336
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:18,960
Tell me, guys.

337
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,760
why didn't she have any reaction?

338
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,720
Look,

339
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,000
I won't say no to be an audience,

340
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,960
but I think

341
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,920
it's better the three of you

342
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,200
stop fooling around now.

343
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,600
Especially you,

344
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
beware of getting yourself into trouble.

345
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Then what do you think?

346
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,120
Just tell her the truth.

347
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,080
I tell her the truth?

348
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,520
Yeah.

349
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,280
I say,

350
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,520
her Prince Charming is better than me in every aspect.

351
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,560
He is some kind of elite studying abroad,

352
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,400
while I am only here

353
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,200
being an ordinary student?

354
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,520
I say I'm envious and jealous?

355
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,640
Right.

356
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,320
Here's the thing.

357
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,000
If two people are together,

358
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,840
although it is said to let nature take its course,

359
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,480
you still have to manage it.

360
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,000
Right?

361
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,440
Look,

362
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,840
you've been together for quite long.

363
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,040
Being suspicious of each other,

364
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,320
don't you feel tired of that?

365
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
You do have a point.

366
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,560
But,

367
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,480
I think

368
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
about that "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth",

369
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,720
we need to talk more.

370
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,960
How about next time

371
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
you dress up as a girl again?

372
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,800
Why me again?

373
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,840
Or let me try it?

374
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,600
Why are you here again?

375
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
Nobody stopped you again?

376
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,400
Yeah.

377
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,920
Well, the practice will start soon.

378
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,440
Let's go see a movie before the practice, shall we?

379
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,880
I already bought the tickets.

380
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,960
What movie?

381
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,840
A meaningless

382
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,960
commercial film.

383
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,200
I remembered you said commercial films were clichÃ©.

384
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,880
But you like them.

385
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,920
You two just go!

386
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,760
So, you just get prepared.

387
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,880
I'll wait for you downstairs.

388
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,440
Yes!

389
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,600
Still there, still there.

390
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,800
What time is the movie?

391
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,640
In the afternoon. Why?

392
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,040
Ehâ€¦

393
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,040
Nothing.

394
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,120
My childhood friend will come to visit me this evening.

395
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,960
And then,

396
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,000
I have to

397
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,080
take a walk around here,

398
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,080
show her around,

399
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,440
and visit the campus, right?

400
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,320
What time did you say?

401
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,200
What timeâ€¦

402
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,600
When we were kids, I always followed her lead.

403
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,040
So, whatever time she says.

404
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,480
My childhood friend could catch one for sure.

405
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,280
What do you think of this?

406
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,240
My childhood friend

407
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,600
likes this kind of flower skirt particularly.

408
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,560
Back then,

409
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,120
every day after school,

410
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,000
I took my childhood friend home by bike.

411
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,520
You know what?

412
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,720
When people are young, they weigh less.

413
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
She was riding just behind me.

414
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,080
And I just carried her

415
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,120
heading forward.

416
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,360
I was quite fast.

417
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,400
Besides, beforeâ€¦

418
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,680
Look,

419
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,120
it's working now.

420
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
Number four,

421
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,120
closing.

422
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,000
OK.

423
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,840
Then let's follow this framework

424
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,640
and sort out the offensive

425
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
and defensive points.

426
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,000
I think for every point

427
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,680
there should be at least two

428
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,760
examples and questions.

429
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:58,960
OK.

430
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,680
I have a dinner date with Weiwei today,

431
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,800
and I want to confess to her at dinner.

432
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,960
Expecting good news from you.

433
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Look!

434
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,760
He is going to confess to Weiwei.

435
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,480
Now you have nothing to worry about, right?

436
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,240
I never worried about that.

437
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,120
What are you going to do later?

438
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
My childhood friend will come.

439
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,040
I have to have dinner with her.

440
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,720
Who is your childhood friend?

441
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes!

442
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,440
Yeah.

443
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,280
You are here already?

444
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,200
You guys go ahead. I have to go now.

445
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,040
Just give me a second.

446
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,360
I'll pick you up right away.

447
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:42,840
Yes.

448
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,600
OK.

449
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,480
Let's continue.

450
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,080
Nan Bei, come here right now!

451
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,200
What do you want?

452
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm catching up with my childhood friend.

453
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,360
Nonsense!

454
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Are you angry?

455
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,680
Of course!

456
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,400
Now you know how I felt.

457
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,600
Let me tell you something, Nan Bei.

458
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,400
Back in high school, I was young and ignorant,

459
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,800
so I did think he was not bad.

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,760
But that was

461
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,400
before I met you.

462
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,960
This time he came back,

463
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,440
before dinner, when you were on your way,

464
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,080
I've already told him

465
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,240
that I had a boyfriend now.

466
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,640
Besides,

467
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,080
he just wanted to pursue

468
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
a girl he had liked for many years.

469
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
I was just helping with some ideas.

470
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,720
That's it.

471
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,360
I already have you

472
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,920
as my boyfriend.

473
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm not the kind of

474
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,160
fickle girl.

475
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,720
Remove all your thoughts

476
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
about those dramas!

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
If only you had said so earlier.

478
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,000
Come on, give me a hug.

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,760
It's too hot.

480
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,400
In the end, I still didn't say it.

481
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,560
Maybe

482
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
I was afraid of failure.

483
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,320
Let's go!

484
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,720
Where to?

485
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
To meet your Prince Charming of high school.

486
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,000
Sorry.

487
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,440
It's so late.

488
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,360
And you guys

489
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,280
came here because of me.

490
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,360
Glad you know.

491
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,720
What is the real reason?

492
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm leaving next week.

493
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,560
But I'm not sure

494
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,520
if she would be willing to wait for me.

495
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,440
After all, a long-distance relationship

496
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,800
would cause a lot of problems.

497
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,200
And I'm afraid

498
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,520
that all of these

499
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,200
are just my wishful thinking,

500
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,280
my fantasy.

501
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,240
Maybe Weiwei

502
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,520
does not have any feelings for me at all.

503
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,960
Do you understand?

504
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,320
Yes, I do.

505
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,320
But I think

506
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,040
it is precisely because of this

507
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,280
that you should tell her.

508
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,400
What if you regret it later?

509
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,200
In this era, long-distance relationships

510
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,880
should not be

511
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
a serious problem, right?

512
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,880
Even in a same city,

513
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,640
even in a same college,

514
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,440
like me and Nan Bei,

515
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,440
we have issues frequently.

516
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,160
Every day I have

517
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,120
a new reason to kill him for.

518
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,120
Hey!

519
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,160
Well,

520
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,720
don't listen to her nonsense.

521
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,920
We have a solid relationship.

522
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,160
But I think

523
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,520
as long as two people have feelings for each other,

524
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,640
even if he has so many problems,

525
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,400
even if he is childish, stingy,

526
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,120
bragging and jealous,

527
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,760
so what?

528
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,480
I wouldn't

529
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,560
stop liking him

530
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,440
just because

531
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
someone better than him appeared.

532
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,520
Don't think too much.

533
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,560
Even if all these craps add up,

534
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,440
I'm sure it's better than

535
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,400
that you can't be with her,

536
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,960
right?

537
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,880
Thank you, Xiaoyu.

538
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,200
Thank you, Nan Bei.

539
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,000
Send it!

540
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,600
Nan Bei and I,

541
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
can only help you to this point.

542
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,880
We are leaving now.

543
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,240
Let's go.

544
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Wait, are we leaving now?

545
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,640
I haven't finished yet.

546
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,200
Come on, let's go!

547
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,480
See you then.

548
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,720
Don't be too cocky.

549
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,080
I just said that

550
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,840
purely to

551
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
make Gong Chen feel better.

552
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
I got it already.

553
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,800
Wow!

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,960
Weiwei

555
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,680
does not have a good taste.

556
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,840
I'm telling you,

557
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,280
I have the worst taste in the world.

558
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:10,800
Hey,

559
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,320
it seems that

560
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,560
we haven't posted an official announcement

561
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,960
on WeChat Moment.

562
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
Do you want to post it?

563
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,280
Do it, now.

564
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,240
Hmm.

565
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,200
Actually, it's not necessary.

566
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,360
No need for so many troubles.

567
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,040
My Nan Bei has grown up!

568
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,040
Nan Bei, stop right there!

569
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,720
Jingwen,

570
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,760
this is my first time in love.

571
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,600
I know there are many things

572
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,560
I didn't do well enough.

573
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,400
Can you give me another chance?

574
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,200
I promise I can change, everything.

575
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,960
I change it all.

576
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,040
OK?

577
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,360
This is also my first time in love.

578
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,400
But we're really not right for each other.

579
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,040
Both sides have rich and solid arguments.

581
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,280
Seems like it's a tie.

582
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
In the refutation and rebuttal,

583
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Nan Bei and Xiaoyu

584
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,400
also did well.

585
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,840
Even better than the other.

586
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
Now it is the free debate.

587
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,440
It's probably again

588
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,960
the critical moment to create more advantages.

589
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,160
What do you think?

590
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,200
What's the matter?

591
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,640
Look at the state of Xiaoyu and the Prince Charming.

592
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
They seem casual.

593
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,520
Actually, there are frequent confrontations between them.

594
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,480
Look at Xiaoyu, her aura and her spirit.

595
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,400
It is obvious

596
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,040
that she has absolutely no intention

597
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,640
of showing his old lover any mercy.

598
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,080
But, when I look at

599
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,800
the eyes of the Prince Charming,

600
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,240
there is a touch of tenderness.

601
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,240
Could it be that he still

602
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,960
has feelings for her?

603
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,880
Or does he pity her?

604
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,200
It's so complicated. Wonderful!

605
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,280
You're absolutely focusing on the wrong place.

606
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,640
Look at Nan Bei.

607
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,280
He looks calm outside.

608
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,320
In fact, inside

609
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
there is already an undercurrent.

610
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,080
I think

611
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,360
his jealousy

612
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,400
has risen and transformed into a kind of

613
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,000
invincible super shock wave.

614
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,240
Nonsense.

615
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,200
In your argument, you said that

616
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,160
only hard management

617
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,120
will let us know how much

618
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,680
we are willing to devote for the other,

619
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,600
and let us know exactly

620
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,480
how much we love him or her, right?

621
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,760
Of course, it's true.

622
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,760
A relationship with no devotion

623
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,600
will you cherish it?

624
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
If I picked up a piece of gold on the road,

625
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
I would cherish it too.

626
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,520
Allow me to ask you,

627
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,840
when you have made the devotion

628
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,040
only to find that you don't love him or her that much,

629
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,720
what should you do?

630
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,320
Then just break up, make it clear.

631
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,360
So, to get the accurate judgment

632
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:41,920
of the relationship

633
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,600
also requires

634
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,960
hard work.

635
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,200
Then that is wrong again.

636
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,840
When you find that you don't love, make a clean break.

637
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
Isn't that letting nature take its course?

638
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,480
Letting nature take its course is passive.

639
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,640
Making a clean break is active.

640
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
In the way of letting nature take its course,

641
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,720
taking the initiative to break up,

642
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,400
that's not called

643
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,040
"letting nature take its course" at all.

644
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,480
Then please give an example,

645
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,640
what is "letting nature take its course"?

646
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,840
Blacklisting the other.

647
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,520
The act of blacklisting

648
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,480
is actually an active act, isn't it?

649
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,720
He said it wrong.

650
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,800
It's waiting to be blacklisted.

651
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,960
According to the data

652
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,720
from China Public Opinion Survey website,

653
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,800
relationships in college

654
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,760
that last for more than one year

655
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,680
only account for 26%,

656
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,760
more than five years,

657
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,680
less than 10%.

658
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,240
And those that actually lead to marriage

659
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,600
only account for 2%.

660
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,040
The success rate is so low.

661
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,480
What is the point of hard management?

662
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,160
It is precisely because everyone is holding

663
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,360
this thought of yours

664
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,880
and does not manage

665
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,720
that produces

666
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,560
such undesirable data.

667
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,640
Doesn't this prove

668
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,240
our argument,

669
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,880
a relationship in college

670
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,560
requires more effortful management?

671
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,320
For a relationship, is the process more important

672
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,240
or is the result more important?

673
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,400
What is the result of a relationship?

674
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,640
Getting married and having children.

675
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
Is love gone after marriage,

676
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,000
or does it disappear

677
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,800
after a baby is born?

678
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,680
Why getting married and having children

679
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,200
are the result?

680
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
After that, there is growing old together.

681
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,440
Growing old together should be

682
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,720
the process of maintaining a relationship until getting old?

683
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,680
Why does growing old together

684
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,560
become the result now?

685
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Then in your opinion,

686
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,880
what is the result of love?

687
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,840
We believe that

688
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,800
love has no result.

689
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,080
Love in itself is a process.

690
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,480
So your question is not valid.

691
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,280
My fellow debater,

692
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,240
you misunderstood the meaning of the result.

693
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,680
When we say love blossoms and bears fruit,

694
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,680
the result does not mean that

695
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,160
love has come to an end.

696
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,080
It means that

697
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,360
love will enter a more advanced stage.

698
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,440
If defined in this way,

699
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
entering a more advanced level

700
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,680
is more important, of course.

701
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
Otherwise, is what we expect

702
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,840
the superficial love,

703
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,960
or superficial affection

704
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,640
and passion?

705
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,520
Or should we say,

706
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,760
my fellow debaters, are you planning to live a life

707
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,040
just holding hands with your lover

708
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,600
and doing nothing else?

709
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,120
In your opinion,

710
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,160
love is a relationship.

711
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,520
And all relationships need to be managed,

712
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,880
right?

713
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:24,760
That's right

714
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,520
Is unrequited love a relationship?

10715
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,680
Is unrequited love real love?

716
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,080
Isn't unrequited love real love?

717
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,280
Love is the emotion and affection of love

718
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,560
between two people.

719
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,960
Unrequited love is a matter of one person.

720
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,840
Of course, it's not love.

721
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
From the Guan Ju of the Classic of Poetry

722
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
to the Qing Yu An of Xin Qiji,

723
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,480
are those works describing unrequited love

724
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,840
not masterpieces of love literature?

725
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,760
Of course, they are.

726
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,280
Unrequited love is not a love relationship.

727
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
But from the perspective of the types of emotion,

728
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,360
it can be classified into a type of love.

729
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,640
It's not a love relationship,

730
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,560
but it can be classified into love?

731
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,840
My fellow debater, may I ask you

732
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,640
how on earth do you define unrequited love?

733
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,960
My fellow debaters may think that

734
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,720
unrequited love is the sorrow of being along

735
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,520
in the moonlight,

736
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,720
a silent watch from far away,

737
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,960
or being careful to not approach.

738
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,160
I don't think so.

739
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,640
Unrequited love,

740
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,040
sometimes even

741
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,000
you are unaware of that by yourself.

742
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,600
You are unaware that

743
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,160
there is not a single moment

744
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,120
when your eyes

745
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,680
are not laid on her.

746
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,280
You are unaware that

747
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,720
no matter what she does,

748
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,280
you will find all kinds of reasons for her.

749
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,880
You are unaware that

750
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,320
every pen you have

751
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,720
remembers her name.

752
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,320
And you are unaware that

753
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,400
you seem to have set her chat box

754
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,640
on the top of the list

755
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,040
for a long, long time.

756
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,240
Of course, you are unaware that

757
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,560
even your favorite sneakers

758
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
are trampled by her or become dirty,

759
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,800
you won't be angry or sad.

760
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,440
Whenever she wants to hit you,

761
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,280
you might think that

762
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,400
you actually deserve that.

763
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,520
So unrequited love

764
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,720
shouldn't be

765
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,880
the mutual affection in love.

766
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,360
Unrequited love is supposed to be a love

767
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,840
waiting to be discovered.

768
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,080
I feel that

769
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,760
my goose bumps fell all over the floor.

770
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,400
Now it is the final round

771
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
of the tournament,

772
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,000
closing statement session.

773
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,320
First speaker of the affirmative side, please.

774
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,640
Hello, everyone.

775
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
What we're discussing about today

776
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,840
is how to maintain

777
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,880
a relationship in college.

778
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,680
My fellow debaters stated that

779
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,040
we should not maintain a relationship

780
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,400
just for the maintaining,

781
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,520
and we should let nature take its course

782
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,680
and enjoy it as it is.

783
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,200
It seems that

784
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,360
when we are managing

785
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,320
a relationship,

786
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,920
it will no longer be pure and beautiful.

787
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,280
It seems that effortful management

788
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
became a deliberate act

789
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,240
which makes love lose its essence.

790
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,240
But what kind of precious emotion

791
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,840
is not full of deliberate acts?

792
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,600
Effortful management is indeed a kind of deliberate act.

793
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,920
But whose love

794
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,960
is inadvertent?

795
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,080
The best of love

796
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,160
is exactly

797
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,640
the effortful management,

798
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,920
compromises and quarrels,

799
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
and entanglement and contradiction.

800
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,800
It's like,

801
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,040
one second you feel you could slap him,

802
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,120
but the next second it hurts

803
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,480
like your own heart

804
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,800
is being stabbed,

805
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,480
a split personality.

806
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,120
This

807
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,800
is the most charming part

808
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,280
of love.

809
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,600
If we can't learn

810
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,120
this point,

811
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,800
then maybe

812
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,760
we're losing

813
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,680
the most precious wealth in love.

814
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,560
Even I don't eat meat,

815
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,520
you still can eat it.

816
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,360
Lately your protein intake

817
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
has been so low.

818
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,560
Of course, the coach punished you.

819
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,440
No wonder you got cramps.

820
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,720
I volunteered.

821
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,520
Look,

822
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,760
I also like to eat green vegetables now.

823
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,320
So delicious!

824
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,440
A relationship in college,

825
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,760
maybe as my fellow debaters said,

826
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
has a lower success rate.

827
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,840
But when you are facing

828
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,040
every sincere emotion,

829
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,320
please cherish it and take care of it,

830
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,440
and devote our life

831
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,840
to maintain it

832
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,280
and manage it with great effort.

833
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,080
In this way,

834
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,600
every relationship with little hope

835
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,040
is possible to bear

836
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
the sweetest fruit.

837
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,840
Thank you.

838
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Now I declare that

839
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,760
the winner of this tournament is

840
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,840
the affirmative side, Team 235.

841
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,280
Let's congratulate them.

842
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,920
Jingwen

843
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,440
Jingwen

844
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,400
I figured it out.

845
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,160
It was me who took it for granted.

846
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,080
I always thought

847
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,520
I followed your lead in everything

848
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,600
I thought

849
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,360
I was thinking of everything for you.

850
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,840
I thought I was

851
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,440
taking care of everything for you.

852
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
But I

853
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,160
ignored your actual feelings.

854
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,760
I was just living in a dream.

855
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,040
No wonder my name is You Mengyuan.

856
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,160
Jingwen

857
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,880
This time, I won't

858
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,600
apologize to you.

859
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:15,960
Thank you

860
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,160
for being a part of my life.

861
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,120
-Bye.  -Bye.

862
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,320
-Bye.  -Bye.

863
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,040
Bye.

864
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,360
Will you go to see

865
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,880
the Hitchcock movie tomorrow?

866
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,120
It's still early.

867
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
How about we walk a little longer?
