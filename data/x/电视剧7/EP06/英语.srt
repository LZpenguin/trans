Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP06

2
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,320
Girls, please get ready.

3
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,240
The next group includes students whose student number is from 1160201

4
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,400
to 116220.

5
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,200
Is it Qing's turn now?

6
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
She's in the next group.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
Yesterday Sa came to see me.

8
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Er.

9
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,040
He also keeps

10
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,840
texting me every day.

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,000
So you didn't change

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,680
your decision?

13
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,080
Or what?

14
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,640
I'd rather use the time to eat hot pot

15
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,680
and watch TV.

16
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm not that silly. Go and lose competitions? It's not fun at all.

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,400
Don't worry, Qing.

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Fanfan and I will help you.

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,320
Sorry, I can't.

20
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,240
I want to break the records.

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,360
Come on.

22
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,720
I'll help you.

23
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,760
Come on.

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,240
Come on.

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,160
Come on.

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,440
Ow!

27
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,720
It's okay. I won't give up on you.

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,600
I'll help you.

29
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,440
Just run yourself, or we'll all fail.

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,840
It's okay.

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,200
Come on.

32
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,400
Come on.

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,640
Come on.

34
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,400
Come on.

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,080
Come on.

36
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,640
Just run yourself.

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,320
No, no, no.

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,240
Hold on, hold on.

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,880
We won't give up on you.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,520
We've taken a lap.

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
Or we'll all fail the exam.

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,440
Hey.

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,200
What are you doing?

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,320
Come on, Qing.

45
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,440
Come on, Qing. We'll run with you.

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,480
Come on.

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
Come on. Come on.

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,840
Come on.

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,080
What are they doing?

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
Run with us. We run too?

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Come on. Come on.

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,920
Come on.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,400
Come on, Qing.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
Come on.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
Come on. Come on.

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,720
We've finished.

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Lu Wenqing. Four minutes and twenty-three seconds.

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,920
Pass just right.

59
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,240
You passed!

60
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
I never expected to

61
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,240
pass the 800-meter exam.

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,560
I also never expected that

63
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
it could be so fun

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,400
to run 800 meters.

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,280
Don't get me wrong.

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
But you girls are so weird.

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
What's the point of

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
running together?

69
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,760
You know nothing about girls' friendship.

70
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,760
I understand.

71
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,000
It's awesome.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,840
In fact, I may

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,960
have made a little too much of a fuss before.

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,640
Now, I've finished it.

75
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,560
It is no big deal.

76
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,120
As long as we screwed up our courage,

77
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,040
nothing is impossible.

78
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
My name's You Mengyuan.

79
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,240
I think you are very pretty.

80
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,400
When do you have time?

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,720
I wonder if you

82
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,200
want to see a movie with me?

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,040
Does he just ask her out?

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Yeah.

85
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Will he get a chance?

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,640
I don't think so.

87
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,560
Towel?

88
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,440
20 yuan.

89
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,160
Where's Mengyuan?

90
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,080
Who knows?

91
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Maybe his expression of love was refused

92
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
and he's crying in the corner.

93
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,160
Xiaoyu

94
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,080
I want to say something to you.

95
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,800
Me, too.

96
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
Thank you for helping me today.

97
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
Enjoy yourselves.

98
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Well.

99
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,280
Cheers!

100
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,320
Do me a favor.

101
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
Okay.

102
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,560
Do you remember ......

103
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,320
Let's go together next time.

104
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,400
Shall we go somewhere else?

105
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,520
Have more.

106
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,400
What a coincidence.

107
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,560
Xiaoyu

108
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,680
Yin Nan, are you threatening me?

109
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,400
Don't get me wrong.

110
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,520
I didn't except to meet you here.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
As for Tony,

112
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,280
I heard that yesterday someone was sneaking

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,320
in front of the dormitory

114
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,360
and was doing something weird.

115
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm afraid that it may be stolen.

116
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,240
For the sake of its safety,

117
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,760
I take it

118
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
with me wherever I go.

119
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,880
Don't play innocent!

120
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,240
It was you who

121
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,120
picked up my pet, right?

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,240
You got it two weeks ago, didn't you?

123
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,080
You know it clearly

124
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
whether I'm telling the truth or not.

125
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,840
Even if you are telling the truth,

126
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,920
I want to ask you that

127
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,640
how irresponsible

128
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,840
are you

129
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
to lose the pet turtle.

130
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
It is not as naughty as a Husky.

131
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,560
This is a pet turtle.

132
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Its last owner

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,120
abandoned it,

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
and I adopted it.

135
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,080
Any problems?

136
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,360
Yin Nan

137
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,440
It was me who lost it.

138
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
It's not Xiaoyu's fault.

139
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,160
You two have known each other

140
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
for quite a long time.

141
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,080
She knew clearly that you are careless

142
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,440
and still let you look after the turtle.

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,360
She is irresponsible, too.

144
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,520
It's my fault.

145
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,360
Whatever,

146
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,120
the turtle is innocent.

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,520
You can ask me to do anything,

148
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,840
as long as you give it back to Xiaoyu.

149
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,960
You make me

150
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,360
sound like an unreasonable villain.

151
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
There's no evidence

152
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,120
can prove directly that

153
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,040
my Tony is your Little Xiaoyu.

154
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,720
Sorry, I can't give it to you.

155
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I've got an idea.

156
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,680
How about let Little Xiaoyu

157
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,920
make the choice itself.

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,680
Little Xiaoyu

159
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,480
Tony

160
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,600
Little Xiaoyu

161
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,680
Tony

162
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,400
Tony

163
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,640
Come here.

164
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,560
Okay. It only works for dogs.

165
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,160
Today,

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,720
you and me,

167
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,920
only one can take it home.

168
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,960
What do you want to do?

169
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,160
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

170
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,360
What're you doing?

171
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,280
Don't be

172
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,760
so emotional

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,440
and play so rough.

174
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,160
This is a public place. We need to settle this

175
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,920
in a serious way.

176
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,400
Okay?

177
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,160
So what should

178
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,920
we do, now?

179
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,480
Hey.

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,120
I have seen

181
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
what's going on there.

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,680
I have a solution for you.

183
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,880
This "Super Spicy Duel"

184
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,000
is a tradition of our restaurant.

185
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,480
In front of you are

186
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,440
three kinds of chili sauce

187
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,600
which are extra spicy, super spicy and deadly spicy.

188
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,200
The one who can eat three French fries

189
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,000
dipped in the chili sauce one by one

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,640
within five minutes

191
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
and not drink water in 30 seconds

192
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
will be free of charge for this meal.

193
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,560
May I remind you of a little something I'd like to call?

194
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,960
Nobody has succeeded

195
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,440
since I opened the restaurant.

196
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,960
Little Xiaoyu will

197
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
belong to the one who wins.

198
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
I say it one last time

199
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,280
its name is Tony.

200
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,560
It has nothing to do with you.

201
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,800
I won't let you

202
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,600
fight alone.

203
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,000
I finally get a chance

204
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,760
to make amends for

205
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,800
losing Little Xiaoyu.

206
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,880
You can rest assured that

207
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I'll do my best.

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm here with you!

209
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,240
And I'm here with Senior Yin Nan.

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,600
Ready.

211
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,600
Go!

212
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Just so so.

213
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

214
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,560
Just so so.

215
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,920
Stop your bravado.

216
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,800
Your face is as red as the cherries.

217
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,240
As red as cherries.

218
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,640
So what?

219
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,600
You are drenched with sweat

220
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
and have your eyes filled with tears.

221
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,840
What's the matter? Is your life too hard?

222
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,680
Those are

223
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,560
tears of pity for you loser.

224
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
Here comes the spiciest one.

225
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,280
I can even

226
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,920
feel the spiciness here.

227
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,640
Countdown begins.

228
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,920
Ten.

229
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,840
Nine.

230
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,520
Eight.

231
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,440
Seven.

232
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,360
Six.

233
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,200
Five.

234
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,080
Four.

235
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,520
Water.

236
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,400
I win!

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,680
You make it!

238
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,640
I win!

239
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,360
I win!

240
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,720
Does it make any sense of winning me in eating spicy food?

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
Of course.

242
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,080
I once thought that

243
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,680
I would never stand a chance to win you.

244
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,200
But now I got you in eating spicy food.

245
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,800
Give my baby back to me!

246
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,640
You should admit your failure.

247
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,120
Little Xiaoyu is ours now.

248
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
My baby.

249
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,760
My baby.

250
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,640
Water. Get some water.

251
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,080
Be careful.

252
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,680
You have acute gastroenteritis.

253
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,640
The doctor said

254
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,320
it is because

255
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
you have eaten too much spicy food.

256
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,240
It is worthwhile.

257
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,880
What did you

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,520
want to say to me in the restaurant?

259
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,720
You must have guessed it.

260
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,080
Then let's talk to Sa tomorrow.

261
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,160
How did you think it through?

262
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,280
I've promised you

263
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,520
to win the champion together with you.

264
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,880
How could I forget

265
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
my promise?

266
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,080
It is you

267
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,200
who firmly refused to join the team again.

268
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,840
I used to think that

269
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,920
no matter how hard you try,

270
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,040
little difference would be made on some matters.

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
Now Qing has overcome her greatest difficulty.

272
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,080
It suddenly occurred to me

273
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,120
that I'd better give it a shot again.

274
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
Maybe I'll make it.

275
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,560
Right?

276
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Okay.

277
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,280
Then

278
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm still the captain of our team.

279
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:22,960
Good.

280
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,240
Finally,

281
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,640
our team will be back in the arena.

282
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,640
Er.

283
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,680
Do we need to

284
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,400
go to the previous classroom for training?

285
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Will we get training together with Team One?

286
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,040
Dango

287
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,400
Could you please dream bigger

288
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
and find a better example?

289
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,360
Okay.

290
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,960
I now declare that

291
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
Debate Team Two

292
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,640
is officially established.

293
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,560
Yeah!

294
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,000
Give ourselves a big round of applause!

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,640
Yeah!

296
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,040
Well.

297
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,280
What's the schedule for the next training session

298
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,280
and training classroom for Team Two?

299
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,120
By the way,

300
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,680
in addition to

301
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,200
the daily competitions,

302
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,480
I'd like to invite

303
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,840
debate teams from other schools

304
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,000
to compete with Team Two.

305
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,000
After all, this team

306
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,560
still needs to be polished.

307
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,360
As for the training classroom,

308
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,880
you may share it with Team One.

309
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,000
You two teams can use it together.

310
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,920
And the rest of the arrangements,

311
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,200
you may listen to Team One.

312
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,880
Listen ......

313
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,800
Listen to Team One?

314
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,520
Yeah.

315
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,960
You Team Two

316
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,560
is supposed to serve the Team One.

317
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,240
Nan Bei and Xiaoyu

318
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
will kill me, if they know this.

319
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,240
Today, the school officially issued a notice that

320
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
the registration of CET-4

321
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,560
will begin this week.

322
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,800
At the meeting, the secretary of the party committee of the university

323
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
once again stressed

324
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,880
the importance of English proficiency

325
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,920
of college students

326
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,280
and asked teachers in charge of each grade

327
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,720
to strictly supervise students to enter for the exam.

328
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,640
Here is a report from our correspondent in the university.

329
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
Now let's listen to

330
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,800
the students' opinions.

331
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,040
Here comes a boy.

332
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,520
Good morning. May I ask you a question?

333
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,640
Do you have any thoughts

334
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
on the approach of CET-4?

335
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,360
Stop it. Stop it.

336
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,080
Er.

337
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,920
Good morning.

338
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
The CET-4 is approaching.

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,760
Are you well-prepared?

340
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,000
He may be busy with

341
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
his review plans.

342
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,080
Let's interview

343
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,840
this girl here.

344
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,520
Good morning.

345
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,360
The CET-4 is coming next week.

346
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,560
How are you getting on with your preparation?

347
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,320
CET-4.

348
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,400
CET-4.

349
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,560
CET-4.

350
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,760
CET-4.

351
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,480
CET-4.

352
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,440
CET-4.

353
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,640
CET-4.

354
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,560
CET ......

355
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,080
Mengyuan

356
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,680
What kind of pre-workout are you taking?

357
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,240
You are exercising so hard.

358
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,760
Someone interviewed me

359
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
today and

360
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,680
asked me whether I feel nervous

361
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
for the approaching CET-4?

362
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,400
I ......

363
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,400
So I get nervous now.

364
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,560
Are you kidding me, bro?

365
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,920
Your English is so good.

366
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,920
Don't be nervous.

367
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,200
You don't understand.

368
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,800
As a genius,

369
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,040
bearing the tend to go overboard on one subject

370
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,720
is a basic feature, okay?

371
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,040
If I hadn't

372
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,920
bet on the right English composition topic in the exam,

373
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
I really wouldn't have a chance to be here.

374
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,120
You Mengyuan

375
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,200
What are you doing?

376
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,440
Put your clothes on.

377
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,840
The opposite is the girls' dormitory.

378
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,360
You don't know it?

379
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm not afraid of being seen by them.

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm afraid you'll flash people's eyes blind.

381
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,840
Mr. Li, have some water please.

382
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,800
No, thanks.

383
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,520
I'm not thirsty.

384
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,720
Ma Nan

385
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,640
Stop the game.

386
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,320
Pause here.

387
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,920
The CET-4 is approaching.

388
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,440
You know it, right?

389
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,160
Ah.

390
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,760
Be sure to enter for the exam this time, okay?

391
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,640
You haven't registered yet?

392
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,560
Shut up.

393
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,920
Well, Mr. Li.

394
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,720
I just knew the news

395
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,960
two minutes ago.

396
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,440
May you

397
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,280
give me some time to think about it?

398
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,040
How much time do you want?

399
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,400
Just take the exam this time.

400
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,160
After the exam, you leave here

401
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,960
and we'll never see each other again.

402
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,640
Do you get it?

403
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,240
Yeah.

404
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,200
As the dorm monitor,

405
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,080
you need to urge everyone to make progress.

406
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,720
Separate dry and wet garbage.

407
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,440
Okay. Okay.

408
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,040
Okay.

409
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Well. I'm leaving now.

410
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,160
See you, Mr, Li.

411
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,240
Welcome you to come again.

412
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:02,960
I never expected that

413
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,320
your weakness is English.

414
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,840
Don't mention it.

415
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,520
Even now, I have nightmares

416
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,560
about my English college entrance examination.

417
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,880
Er.

418
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,480
I dreamed about the English Listening Comprehension part.

419
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,760
I turned the paper forward

420
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,440
and guess what?

421
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,240
You didn't know the answers at all.

422
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,800
It was finished before the listening material was played.

423
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,120
Er.

424
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,200
Our university is

425
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,880
one of the top universities.

426
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,360
How could you get admitted by our university?

427
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,600
I got a full score in the comprehensive science test.

428
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,160
You got a full score in the comprehensive science test while you chose the Department of Law?

429
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,880
Well.

430
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,040
Have you watched Legal High?

431
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,760
So childish.

432
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,040
You say me childish?

433
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Look at yourself.

434
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,680
You are not a shrewd person.

435
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,760
Why did you choose to learn economics?

436
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,320
Have you watched Hanzawa Naoki?

437
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,320
Oh.

438
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,400
But we have

439
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,640
very similar aesthetic

440
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,680
for men.

441
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
In order to improve your English skills,

442
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,240
from now on,

443
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,440
let's talk in English.

444
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,320
What?

445
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,200
We should be on the same page now.

446
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,400
Stop embarrassing each other.

447
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,280
Today, we're going to

448
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,240
challenge Team One.

449
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,720
Yeah.

450
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,760
Sorry.

451
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Though we are Team Two,

452
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,440
we can't lose in momentum.

453
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,200
You are right.

454
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,840
They will certainly

455
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,560
laugh at us.

456
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,680
"You see see you."

457
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,080
"Uncle know

458
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
make me birth gas."

459
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,720
What're you talking about in English?

460
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,760
What is "birth gas"?

461
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,560
Get angry. (The pronunciation of "birth gas" is similar to "get angry" in Chinese.)

462
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,680
What is "uncle know"?

463
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,600
Know exactly. (The pronunciation of "uncle know" is similar to "know exactly" in Chinese.)

464
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,520
They did a great job setting up here.

465
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,400
It's used for training.

466
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,840
Why did they put so many trophies here?

467
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,480
Where's our stuff?

468
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,160
Here.

469
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,800
Thank God they didn't touch my stuff

470
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
or I'll kill them.

471
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,880
This is my Mr. Green-hat.

472
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,720
Cute, right?

473
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,800
What a

474
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,160
weird name!

475
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
You know nothing.

476
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,800
Come here.

477
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,040
Come and

478
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,680
play this with me.

479
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,080
What?

480
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,120
Come here.

481
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,760
As our old rules,

482
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,760
the one who loses first.

483
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,960
You press this one.

484
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,040
Dare you press this or not?

485
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,280
Not this one. Go on.

486
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,720
Oh my god!

487
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,880
One more time.

488
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,000
We ......

489
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,840
We are members of Team Two.

490
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,120
Xiaoyu. Nan Bei.

491
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,440
You are the Team Two.

492
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,080
Where's your instructor?

493
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
How are you, Mr. Meng?

494
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,640
I'm Sa.

495
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,520
How's the way of my showing up?

496
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,600
Ah?

497
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,240
We can't lose in momentum.

498
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,080
You can call me Mr. Meng.

499
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,520
I'm the instructor of Team One.

500
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,560
May I give you a brief introduction

501
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,960
of the condition of Team One this year.

502
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,600
Three months later,

503
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,680
the Provincial Debate League will be held.

504
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,320
Last year we lost to

505
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,600
South Jiaotong University in the final.

506
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,440
So this year

507
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,240
we only have one goal

508
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,600
that is gain the championship.

509
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,680
This year, the provincial competition

510
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,680
has changed its rules.

511
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,800
For the past two years,

512
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,040
there are

513
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,440
more and more debate teams

514
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
in universities of our province.

515
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,840
And small-scale competitions

516
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,480
are becoming more and more mature.

517
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Therefore, based on the actual situation,

518
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,440
this year's provincial preliminary rounds

519
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
will no longer organize centralized competitions,

520
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,200
but will organize free-point competitions

521
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,720
within three months of the season.

522
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,000
Only those teams with enough points

523
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,720
can goes through to

524
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,600
the grand final and

525
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,280
compete for the championship next year.

526
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,320
Mr. Meng

527
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,040
What is the free-point competition?

528
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
It seems to

529
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,600
have nothing to do with you Team Two.

530
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,880
Well.

531
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,720
The free-point competition means that

532
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,880
we need to

533
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
take part in various competitions

534
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,920
and accumulate points.

535
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,280
It is similar to course selection.

536
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,160
It is up to you

537
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,640
to select your own courses

538
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
as long as you can get enough credits.

539
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,920
So as long as the competitions are officially recognized,

540
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,520
we can gain corresponding points according to their different levels

541
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,680
by attending them.

542
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,400
Generally speaking,

543
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
if you win the competition, you'll get three points

544
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,920
and if lose, you'll get one point.

545
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,400
If we can get 50 points,

546
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,240
we'll participate in the finals.

547
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,520
Then we need to take part in so many competitions.

548
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
I know that you haven't

549
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,560
participated in provincial competitions yet.

550
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,640
So, based on the competition experience

551
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,160
with other teams,

552
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,200
I'll select appropriate teams

553
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
for you as reference.

554
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,520
Of course, I will also take into consideration

555
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,720
your current abilities.

556
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,320
So,

557
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,560
I hope that

558
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,840
Team Two will take part in

559
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,880
as many competitions as possible

560
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,160
to accumulate points

561
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,200
so that Team One will have more time

562
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,080
to prepare for the final

563
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
and win honor for our university.

564
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,160
In a word,

565
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
we'll work together

566
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,000
to win honor for our university.

567
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,600
Next,

568
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
the members of our two teams

569
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
may give a self-introduction

570
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,880
to get to know each .......   Not now.

571
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,120
Not now.

572
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,040
We get plenty of time in the future to know each other.

573
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,160
Yanze

574
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
Here are some competitions

575
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,640
I select

576
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,280
for you Team Two.

577
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,080
You are welcome.

578
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,720
Er.

579
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,640
This is for you.

580
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,680
What would you like to drink, you two?

581
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,080
I didn't order anything, either.

582
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,040
You've been

583
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,840
blacklisted

584
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,840
permanently

585
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,120
since your last visit.

586
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,200
And you can't

587
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,320
order on your own in our restaurant any more.

588
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,440
This soft drink is

589
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,640
specially prepared for you.

590
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,520
Hey.

591
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,480
You must be joking.

592
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,200
No.

593
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,400
Then

594
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,240
you'd better

595
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,760
give me

596
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,800
an extra drink.

597
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,280
Okay.

598
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,520
I want a cola

599
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,200
with extra lemon.

600
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,640
Me too. Thank you.

601
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:55,920
Okay.

602
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,040
So mean.

603
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,760
What competitions are there?

604
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,600
"Wuyuan County Farm Cup"

605
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,920
College Debate Competition.

606
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,080
Maybe we need to

607
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,400
take the train, tricycle

608
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,280
and a donkey cart to go there.

609
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,120
The transportation of villages is quite convenient now.

610
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,240
Well, how about others?

611
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,640
There is a district-level competition here.

612
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,840
Really?

613
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
Then let's attend this one.

614
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,760
Wait.

615
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,480
There is a row of small words below.

616
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,600
Special thanks to

617
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,600
Braised Chicken Rice.

618
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,720
Oh, my!

619
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,480
It is so sour.

620
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,720
It is so ridiculous.

621
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,080
These competitions

622
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,280
are not nearly as good as

623
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,080
the debates

624
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,960
I had in high school.

625
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,360
It's okay.

626
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
After all, these are provincial preliminary contests.

627
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,560
They won't be that bad.

628
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
I assure you with my personality

629
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,360
and experience.

630
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,480
Believe me.

631
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:06,960
Now,

632
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,360
one-on-one debate may begin.

633
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
The debaters may get started.

634
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,040
Regarding the rationality of this phenomenon,

635
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,640
I don't think it is necessary to discuss it again.

636
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,400
Because what exists is reasonable.

637
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,120
Is that right?

638
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,720
No.

639
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,400
Ah?

640
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,720
Is there anything wrong with that?

641
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,160
How could you say no?

642
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,640
It is totally right.

643
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,520
Of course, I have the right

644
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,280
to doubt any of

645
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,360
your opinions.

646
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,760
Who said

647
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,720
"what exists is reasonable"?

648
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
As an old saying goes ......

649
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,200
It originated from

650
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Hegel's

651
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Philosophy of Right.

652
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,840
The original one is

653
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,080
"what is rational

654
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,840
is actual

655
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,760
and what is actual

656
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,000
is rational."

657
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
Later French philosopher Sartre

658
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,480
also said similar words.

659
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,680
But the existence here

660
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,720
refers to actuality

661
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,360
and the reason here means rationality.

662
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,640
It is far more different

663
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
from what you said

664
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,920
the reasons

665
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,080
in social rules.

666
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,000
If the phenomenon of repeating the baseless assertion

667
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,080
can be explained with "what exists is reasonable"

668
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,280
to eliminate the unreasonable things

669
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,320
in daily life.

670
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,840
Is this really reasonable to do so?

671
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,800
So shall we

672
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,480
discuss first

673
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,760
the rationality of the phenomenon?

674
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,000
They are too weak.

675
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,960
Hao

676
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,200
The competitions we'll participate in

677
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,080
won't be all like this, will they?

678
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Probably not.

679
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,800
They can be much worse.

680
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:26,880
Here. Here.

681
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Come here and get coupons please.

682
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,240
Welcome to Wencheng County

683
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,920
College Student Debate Competition.

684
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,080
First, let's warmly welcome

685
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,720
the sponsor of this competition, Mr. Cang,

686
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,920
the chairman of the Board of Directors of

687
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,200
Shaxian Snack Catering Group,

688
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,440
which is 50 meters east of Building 2,

689
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,400
South District Dormitory,

690
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Wencheng Campus.

691
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,400
When talking about debate,

692
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
let's talk about food first.

693
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,120
Why?

694
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,840
Because food is the first necessity of the people.

695
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,120
Right?

696
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,400
Yeah.

697
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,960
For ancient China, if state governance

698
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,320
doesn't have agriculture as its foundation,

699
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,000
it is tantamount to

700
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,280
a direct denial of the economic foundation,

701
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,520
which is the bedrock of development.

702
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,480
So aren't you

703
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
denying that

704
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,680
the economic base

705
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,720
determines the superstructure?

706
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,920
Today,

707
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,360
before the "Noodles Cup" Debate get started,

708
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,800
I only want to tell you one thing

709
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,440
that you all need to work very hard

710
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,200
and be like noodles

711
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,200
which bears excellence in color, aroma and taste.

712
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,080
All creations you have just mentioned

713
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,200
have their explicit definitions.

714
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,000
So I am wondering that

715
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,040
these definitions exist from the very beginning

716
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
or are created by us human beings

717
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,400
subjectively.

718
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,440
Assuming that human beings will be extinct hundreds of years later,

719
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,000
how should we

720
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,600
explain the definitions of

721
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,880
all creations?

722
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,680
Why can they

723
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,640
use more room than us?

724
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,360
It's time to do something.

725
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,920
Four copies, please.

726
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,840
Er.

727
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,240
Your hands don't work or

728
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,080
your brain doesn't work?

729
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,120
You can't use the printer yourself?

730
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,960
Just want to give you something to do

731
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,320
so you won't get bored.

732
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,040
We have

733
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
plenty of things to do.

734
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,400
There are competitions we need to prepare for.

735
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,280
Which one?

736
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,640
The competitions

737
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,160
with the lowest level you've attend this week?

738
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,000
You make us

739
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,920
attend this kind of debates

740
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,160
to get back at us, don't you?

741
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,840
The duty of you Team Two

742
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,440
is to

743
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,680
accumulate points for Team One.

744
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,320
With your current strength,

745
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,800
if you want to get points,

746
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,040
these are the most appropriate ones.

747
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,680
Xiaoyu. Calm down. Calm down.

748
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,800
Don't let your emotions get the best of you.

749
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,160
Calm down. Calm down.

750
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,200
I'll do this.

751
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,600
I'll do it.

752
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,920
Four copies, right?

753
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,240
Wait a moment please.

754
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,240
I'll do it now.

755
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,800
Four copies.

756
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:14,960
Forget it.

757
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,320
Captain of Team Two

758
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,520
I've emailed to you

759
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,600
the competitions your team can attend

760
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,000
the next stage.

761
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,520
The Third "Frog Cup" Debate.

762
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,400
The Sixth "Chocolate Planet Cup" Debate.

763
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,960
We won't participate in this kind of debates.

764
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,200
What do you mean?

765
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,880
We must participate in the kind of debates

766
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,040
you are preparing now.

767
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,000
You are not

768
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,720
capable enough to participate in this kind of debates.

769
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,760
Who said that?

770
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,600
I said.

771
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,640
You got a problem?

772
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah.

773
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,000
We'll have a response training this afternoon.

774
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,960
If you don't afraid of embarrassing yourself,

775
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,600
you can come.

776
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,600
During response training,

777
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,200
both sides refute the opinions of each other

778
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,800
and you should response immediately.

779
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,680
The one who hesitates more than half a second will lose.

780
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
The one who randomly choose the topic will be team AFF.

781
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,000
The debate topic is

782
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,720
silence is gold.

783
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,120
Start!

784
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,200
The world is complicated and the life is hard to explain.

785
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,160
In the face of many things,

786
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,240
language is too weak to make a difference.

787
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,400
So silence is more adoptable.

788
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,880
Objection!

789
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,080
Language is not weak at all.

790
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,280
On the contrary, it is by means of language that human beings can communicate with each other,

791
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,240
so that the weak individuals

792
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,160
can become a strong community.

793
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400
A community may be stronger than an individual,

794
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,080
but it can't solve

795
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,800
all problems.

796
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,560
On many conditions,

797
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,880
we just have to be wordless,

798
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,320
don't we?

799
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,400
So, on what kind of problem,

800
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,160
should we be wordless

801
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,960
to solve it?

802
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,120
Time is up.

803
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:13,840
Again.

804
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,280
Start!

805
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,840
Silence means refusing to communicate.

806
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,760
How could the refusal of communication

807
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,680
be seen as valuable?

808
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,400
Does silence always mean a refusal to communicate?

809
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,240
Silence can be

810
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,520
"looking at each other wordlessly with tears trickling down the cheeks",

811
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,960
"holding hands with tears in eyes,

812
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,800
we can't say a word but all choked up."

813
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,200
and "Silent is Cambridge tonight!". (These lines are from famous Chinese poems.)

814
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,120
What a beautiful love story!

815
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,280
Isn't it valuable?

816
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,360
Love is fleeting

817
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,520
while gold can exist for thousands of years.

818
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,320
It seems that the two

819
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,280
have nothing in common at all.

820
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,600
You can't just deny the eternity of love

821
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,880
for you are not loved.

822
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,960
Well,

823
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,960
that's just

824
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,920
sour grapes.

825
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,160
I've been in love twice.

826
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
How about you?

827
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,720
Time is up.

828
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,400
Calm down.

829
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,440
I'll teach them a lesson.

830
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,440
The topic is

831
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
whether the world is a contingency

832
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
or certainty?

833
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,480
Your turn.

834
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,920
Start!

835
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,200
The world is a contingency.

836
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
If the world is a certainty,

837
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,920
please give me some examples on

838
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,480
absolute certainty.

839
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,040
The world is an absolute certainty.

840
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,240
You are changing the concepts.

841
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,200
In your context,

842
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,720
the world and the certainty are the same stuff.

843
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,560
Then your answer can be summarized as

844
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,440
the certainty is a certainty.

845
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,520
Isn't this nonsense?

846
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,080
The world is full of contingencies.

847
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,320
Because the world is complicated,

848
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,160
which leads to the continuous occurrence

849
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,720
of random events.

850
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,320
This is exactly the contingency of the world.

851
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
Everything has its cause and effect.

852
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,080
You are just an ordinary mortal.

853
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,280
It is not surprising that you think the world is complicated.

854
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,920
Well, how do you think

855
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,080
Démon de Laplace?

856
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,760
Démon de Laplace.

857
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
It is assumed that this demon

858
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,520
knows the information

859
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,120
of every elementary particle

860
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,040
in the universe,

861
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,800
so it can predict

862
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,760
the future.

863
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,480
But quantum mechanics

864
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,120
has proved that

865
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,440
this is impossible.

866
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,720
Time itself is meaningless

867
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,320
in the microcosm,

868
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,520
so how could prediction be carried out?

869
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,880
Just now, you said contingency

870
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,160
means randomness.

871
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,800
But if

872
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,120
time is not exist,

873
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,960
how could randomness

874
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,120
happen?

875
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,200
Does it have to be

876
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,960
based on the existence of time?

877
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,760
Contingency is

878
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,200
presented at the macro level.

879
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,640
For example,

880
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,720
I'm clarifying my point now,

881
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,120
but I cannot predict

882
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,760
how will you refute my opinions.

883
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,000
But the certainty is reflected in that

884
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,840
you will lose to me for sure.

885
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,080
Time is up.

886
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,160
See.

887
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,600
You'll lose to me.

888
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,880
Nan Bei

889
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,480
Take a break.

890
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,600
It's on me.

891
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,320
Dango

892
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,760
Calm down. Calm down.

893
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,480
Sorry.

894
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,840
I didn't perform well enough today.

895
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,560
Relax. Relax.

896
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
It's okay.

897
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,360
Not surprising.

898
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,760
Don't worry. Don't worry.

899
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,280
It's normal.

900
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,280
Ah?

901
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,680
I'm very curious that

902
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,320
what's wrong

903
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
with you and Liu Yanze.

904
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,960
Lose my love forever.

905
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,800
Rivals in love?

906
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,760
Not that kind of love.

907
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,280
Oops.

908
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,360
Forget it.

909
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,480
You can't win him in the debate.

910
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,520
And you didn't

911
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,880
win Yin Nan either.

912
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,480
What is the point of

913
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,640
us being here every day?

914
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
It is so hard.

915
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
It doesn't matter that we win or lose.

916
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,440
What matters is

917
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,960
that we should

918
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,160
learn from our failures.

919
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,080
Dango

920
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,720
Ah?

921
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,560
You need to focus on

922
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,200
the training of making conclusions.

923
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,440
I make the conclusion?

924
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,080
I'm the first debater.

925
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,920
Nan Bei and Xiaoyu work well together,

926
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,320
so they can be the second debater and the third debater.

927
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,120
You need to ......

928
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,880
I can't.

929
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,040
You all saw

930
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,680
my performance just now.

931
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,680
Will you rest assured

932
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,480
to let me be the fourth debater?

933
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,280
I think

934
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,160
we should invite a qualified one.

935
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
It's not that easy.

936
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,600
I'll discuss it with Sa.

937
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,480
You just continue to

938
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,560
prepare the competitions.

939
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
What are you doing?

940
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,560
The class isn't over yet.

941
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,880
No?

942
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Sorry. Sorry, Miss.

943
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,160
I thought I was hearing the bell just now.

944
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,840
Me, too.

945
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,160
Well.

946
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,160
The teacher has called the roll already.

947
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,720
Boy and girls.

948
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,000
The CET-4

949
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,720
is around the corner.

950
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,680
You need to cherish every second

951
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,800
to get well-prepared for the exam.

952
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,200
I'm not scaring you that

953
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,760
you should pass the exam as soon as possible.

954
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,840
By the time you're a junior or senior,

955
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,480
you won't remember

956
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,600
a single word on this list.

957
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,080
Help me.

958
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm busy.

959
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,200
I'll teach Qing and Dango.

960
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,760
Teach me, please.

961
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,640
I have no time.

962
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,360
Help me. Help me.

963
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,600
Okay. Okay. Okay.

964
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,040
Nan Bei

965
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,520
Nan Bei

966
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,600
Mr. Director

967
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,920
Though I've been late for class a lot lately,

968
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,400
I really ......

969
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,960
We'll discuss that later.

970
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,080
You keep an eye on

971
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,280
your roommate Ma Nan and

972
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,440
make sure he must register for CET-4 this time.

973
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,280
Last year, he didn't graduate

974
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,200
just because of this.

975
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,920
This is a waste

976
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,200
of school resources.

977
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,600
He didn't register for the exam last year?

978
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,800
Does CET-4

979
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,560
cast a shadow on him?

980
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
The shadow is casted through experiences.

981
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,800
He didn't enter for the exam once.

982
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,040
How could the shadow be casted on him?

983
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,160
Okay. I'll keep an eye on him.

984
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,600
I got it.

985
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,960
What did you say just now? Who's late?

986
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
No. Nobody.

987
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
See you, Mr. Li.

988
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,320
You got kicked out of school?

989
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,600
I have to pool money to retake the courses.

990
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,560
But this ......

991
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,200
This is good stuff.

992
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,440
What a pity to sell it.

993
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
Why don't you just enter for the CET-4 examination

994
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,280
and graduate this year?

995
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,760
Your parents will certainly give you money.

996
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,280
Does Mr. Li ask you to persuade me?

997
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,520
You just do me a favor,

998
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,680
so that he won't come and bother me again.

999
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,520
Okay.

1000
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,960
Then I'll sign you up for the exam.

1001
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
I forgot my student number.

1002
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,040
You have been here for five years.

1003
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,120
You told me you forgot your student number?

1004
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,280
I've been here for five years.

1005
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,960
I'm too old to remember it.

1006
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,080
Then tell me

1007
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,600
your ID number.

1008
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
I can't remember the student number which consists of just 10 numbers.

1009
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,280
How could I remember the ID number which consists of 18 numbers?

1010
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,240
You must be joking.

1011
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,240
Fine.

1012
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
I'll figure it out for you.

1013
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,240
As your good friend,

1014
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,160
I can't let you give up on yourself.

1015
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,240
Okay. Figure it out for me.

1016
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:34,760
Okay.

1017
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,280
Okay. Then you help me sell all these.

1018
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,440
I've got some stuff to do.

1019
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,720
Wait. Sell these to whom?

1020
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,200
The peddler who collects scrap

1021
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,960
at the school gate.
