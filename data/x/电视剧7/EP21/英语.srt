00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,500
Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP21

2
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,800
Hello.

3
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,920
Take a seat.

4
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
How can I help you?

5
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,160
Marital infidelity.

6
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
You must be

7
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,880
my five o'clock patient.

8
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,480
What?

9
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Here's your medical history.

10
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
Your name is

11
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,040
Yao Shen.

12
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,760
It's written here

13
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
that you have multiple personality disorder.

14
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,840
That's very rare in our country.

15
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,280
It's worth some

16
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
intensive study.

17
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,600
Now,

18
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
we'll chat to all of

19
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,960
the personalities inside you.

20
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,560
OK, let's chat.

21
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
It's written here that

22
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,960
you have a personality called

23
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
Wang Jiajia.

24
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,160
A girl born

25
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,160
in Xi'an in 1990.

26
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,280
Right, I'm a girl

27
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,480
from Xi'an.

28
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,280
When we were dating,

29
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
I was too

30
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,040
self-centered.

31
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,120
I pushed a lot of work

32
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,280
I should have done myself

33
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
onto you.

34
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,160
I didn't think about it from your perspective.

35
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
I feel like I should apologize to you,

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,680
Hao.

37
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Sorry, Hao.

38
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
I smacked him in the face,

40
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,080
then I pulled him up

41
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,680
and kicked him in the butt.

42
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
Then I dragged him over and smacked him.

43
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
Wow.

44
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,800
So, just now

45
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,360
that was Shi Hu,

46
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,400
40-year-old security guard from Northeast China.

47
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,920
Very interesting.

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,680
Hey,

49
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,160
maybe that's enough for today.

50
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
I, I'm tired, really.

51
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,960
No!

52
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,720
There's still one more.

53
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,240
This one's even more interesting.

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,080
He's called Huang Daxian.

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
Thank you, doctor.

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Right, Huang Daxian is…

57
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,040
Here.

58
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,680
This old man has calculated,

59
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,080
you'll be met soon with…

60
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,800
Ma Nan?

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,760
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,640
There are birds in couples on the trees.

63
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,640
An anxiety disorder?

64
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,360
Right.

65
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,160
After I broke up with Hao,

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,320
I discovered

67
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
I'd been relying on her a lot.

68
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,720
When all of the work

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,040
she'd been doing for me

70
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,000
all piled

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,920
back on me again,

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,600
I went crazy.

73
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,040
I really can't imagine

74
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,680
how she took care of

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,920
so much work alone before.

76
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,000
Not only did she have a lot of work stress,

77
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
but actually,

78
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,680
I've also realized

79
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
I was always…

80
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,840
Frankly, I was always

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
taking advantage of Hao.

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,640
So I really blamed myself.

83
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
During that time, I was really

84
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,720
anxious and couldn't sleep.

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,280
It got progressively worse until now.

86
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm actually seeing a psychiatrist.

87
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,840
I never thought

88
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,680
you'd become like this.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
It has nothing to do with you.

90
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,160
It's my problem.

91
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,760
After that the doctor told me

92
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,680
I need to

93
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
face up to

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,080
the mistakes I'd made,

95
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,320
so I asked

96
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
Hao to come with me

97
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,400
to this session.

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,040
It's also a way of me making a break

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,200
from my past.

100
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,920
But this is really

101
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,960
the very last time

102
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I bother Hao.

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,520
Sorry for the trouble.

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,840
And sorry for worrying you.

105
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,760
Huh?

106
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
Hao didn't tell you

107
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
probably because she was afraid you'd get the wrong idea.

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,000
We…

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Don't worry. We're fine.

110
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,280
Then…

111
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,560
I won't bother you two.

112
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,320
Alright.

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,640
Take care of yourself.

114
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,600
Hao.

115
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,840
Goodbye.

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,520
Goodbye.

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,920
Yeah.

118
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,560
B-Bye.

119
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,640
Don't waste your energy explaining.

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,440
If we are just regular friends,

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,720
you stalk me

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
and pretend to be crazy…

123
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,840
What was that for?

124
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,960
That's a good question.

125
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,920
I…

126
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,040
Not long ago,

127
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
someone

128
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
taught me a lesson

129
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,400
that

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,360
people should live

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,480
the lives they want to live,

132
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
and do the things they want to do,

133
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,560
and not worry about what others think.

134
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,360
He made me brave and confident

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
but when it is the moment

136
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,200
he needs to be brave,

137
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
he hesitates.

138
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,880
Honestly,

139
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm a little disappointed.

140
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,040
That guy's just like that.

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
Strict on others, lenient on himself.

142
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,880
He should fix that.

143
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,120
He will.

144
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,600
Fix it quick.

145
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
Hurry up.

146
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,520
- We two are so close. - Look…

147
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,280
Over here.

148
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
How are they taking so long

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,040
to change clothes?

150
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,440
They're probably

151
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,200
using this time

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,920
to go through their points again.

153
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
But why am I

154
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
so flustered?

155
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
Don't worry, Hao.

156
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,040
We'll definitely win.

157
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
But, looking at these points,

158
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,880
I keep thinking it's too unpredictable.

159
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,200
Here they are.

160
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Hello.

161
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,160
Welcome

162
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,400
to today's "Xingyuan"

163
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,600
Tripartite Debate

164
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,680
competition.

165
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
Let me first introduce

166
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,160
each of the debaters.

167
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Firstly, Team A is

168
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
Team 235.

169
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
Their motion is

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,520
"In life,

171
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
first you must learn to go for it".

172
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,240
Let's give them a big welcome.

173
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,000
Hello everyone.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,080
I am the commentator of

175
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,480
this debate, Lao Xu.

176
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm Dalong.

177
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,560
Today we'll be

178
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,480
commentating on this

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,080
competition for

180
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,040
Dry Mango Video users.

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,440
Right now, we introduce Team B.

182
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,520
The steady as a rock

183
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,160
Nanxiang Technical School team.

184
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Their motion today is

185
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,640
"Let go".

186
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,960
And lastly, Team C.

187
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,880
They have been a star in the debate circle

188
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,040
for the past two years.

189
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,360
They just merged into

190
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,760
the new DUFE Team.

191
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,320
Their motion is "Leave it to fate".

192
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,760
This motion,

193
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
hearing it, I feel like

194
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,120
there's a problem there.

195
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
Because it appears to make sense,

196
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,640
but doesn't actually have any points.

197
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Right.

198
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,120
Next, let's begin

199
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,360
with the speeches.

200
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,280
We'll start with the first team.

201
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
Each side has three minutes

202
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,880
for their speeches.

203
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,040
Any debater can speak.

204
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,080
After 30 seconds of one side speaking

205
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
the other two teams

206
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,760
can ring the bell to express disagreement

207
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,640
and contend for the right to speak first and

208
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
proceed with their speech.

209
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
This will continue until the time runs out.

210
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,720
If two sides ring the bell at the same time

211
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,960
or no side rings the bell,

212
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,720
Team A, B and C

213
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,680
will speak in order of A, B, and C.

214
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,600
Now the competition begins.

215
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,160
Hello everyone,

216
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
firstly, let's talk about

217
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,920
this debate topic.

218
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
What does "go for it" mean?

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,040
Is it a description of

220
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,560
our abilities?

221
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,400
I can do this.

222
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,080
I can do that?

223
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,000
Obviously not.

224
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,680
The true meaning of "going for it"

225
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,760
is being brave enough to go for it.

226
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,280
In life, going for it

227
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
is being brave enough to take on and challenge

228
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,040
and chase the things you want

229
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,120
to chase.

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,240
Think about it, in our lives,

231
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,160
aren't there so many

232
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,680
honors, duties

233
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,800
and responsibilities you want to go for?

234
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,680
This allows us to

235
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,280
overcome all of the obstacles

236
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,240
on the road of life

237
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,160
that led up here today.

238
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
In the face of difficulties,

239
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,960
we must keep going for it

240
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
to solve them.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The first time on the debating stage,

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
I have to get up there and not be afraid of embarrassing myself.

243
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,600
As my parents slowly grow old,

244
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,880
I have to take the responsibilities of my family.

245
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,720
When faced with love,

246
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,040
I must have the courage

247
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,960
to go for it,

248
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,200
instead of giving into

249
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,960
my fears

250
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,840
or avoiding it, thinking I'll leave it to fate, to

251
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,360
make excuses for my mediocrity.

252
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,440
Thank you.

253
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,600
That's the point.

254
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,120
Hey.

255
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,240
That point.

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,440
That's a wise point, friends.

257
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,640
The first debater from Team A intentionally

258
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,680
exposed a flaw

259
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,600
for Team C.

260
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,920
That was very smart.

261
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,360
Once Team C steals the floor,

262
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,440
Team B will go next

263
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,520
and they're bound to refute

264
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Team C as their opening statement.

265
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
Then in the first round of speeches,

266
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,120
the focus will be shifted

267
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,000
from Team A to Team C.

268
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,360
So the tactic

269
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
choice is critical.

270
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
If they don't steal the floor, there'll be trouble.

271
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,680
Come on.

272
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,320
Team B has taken the floor.

273
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
They wanted to trick us?

274
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,640
Nice try.

275
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,520
Team A told us that in life,

276
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,960
you have to keep forging ahead and struggling,

277
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,880
you have to strive hard to get

278
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
everything you want.

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,080
That's all true.

280
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,440
But they're using a straw man argument.

281
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,720
In summary, it's that life

282
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
is about constantly

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
going for it, as you say,

284
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
in order to get more.

285
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,200
But must we go for everything

286
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,160
and take it all?

287
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,200
My opponent,

288
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,240
your name is greed.

289
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,840
Impressive.

290
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,920
All of a sudden, the mood

291
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
has changed.

292
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,880
She's trying to win them over with a soft approach.

293
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,520
And getting everything isn't really

294
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,440
an easy thing to do.

295
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,800
"I long to return, riding the wind high,

296
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
yet, of the jade mansions I'm afraid so".

297
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,720
"If we despair in our lifetime of all affairs,

298
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,760
tomorrow let us sail away with loosened hair".

299
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,680
These poems

300
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,520
are all about facing the helplessness

301
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,080
and bitterness of all those things

302
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,240
in life we want but can't have.

303
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,600
Is gaining

304
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
the norm in life?

305
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,120
No, losing is the norm in life.

306
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,720
We're always losing things.

307
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
Losing time. Losing opportunities.

308
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,400
Losing the people we love.

309
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,040
And life makes us

310
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
experience anguish and difficulty

311
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,880
in the midst of all this repeated loss.

312
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,920
So,

313
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
we need to learn to let go.

314
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,360
It's the only way we can

315
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,200
put our limited

316
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,480
energy and resources

317
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,720
towards the more important

318
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,040
choices in life.

319
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,960
Then we'll know

320
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
what are things we must go for,

321
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,160
what is worth daring to go for.

322
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Then we'll have the power

323
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,200
to face this world.

324
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,000
Team A's proposition of going for it

325
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,920
was inspiring.

326
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
Team B's argument of letting go

327
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,200
was thought-provoking.

328
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,480
However, today our side's position is:

329
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,520
"Leave it to fate".

330
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,160
It seems like we should just go ahead

331
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,720
and sit back down.

332
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
Win or lose, we'll just leave it to fate.

333
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,400
That's right.

334
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
No.

335
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,960
But if I just sit and wait for the results,

336
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,760
that's not leaving it to fate,

337
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,080
that's giving up, right?

338
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,280
Aside from religious interpretation,

339
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,120
we believe

340
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,720
leaving it to fate isn't about not making a choice,

341
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
it's about not forcing one.

342
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,360
Adapting to the time and place,

343
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,480
that's really leaving it to fate.

344
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,400
It's a wise philosophy for life.

345
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,000
Just like if I want to eat braised pork,

346
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,320
but the cafeteria only has fried vegetables

347
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
and Kung Pao chicken left.

348
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,840
Team A would drive ten kilometers

349
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,520
to eat at a restaurant,

350
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
wasting time and money.

351
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Team B would tell themselves to

352
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,680
let it go,

353
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,840
but in their heart,

354
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,920
they'd be a little disappointed.

355
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,000
However our side believes

356
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,560
on the long road of life,

357
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,080
we must first learn to

358
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
choose whichever is better between

359
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,960
the fried vegetables

360
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
and Kung Pao chicken

361
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,560
and accept this choice.

362
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,240
When you learn to leave it to fate

363
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,120
you won't

364
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,840
run out of energy

365
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,760
from wanting too much

366
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
or become despondent from

367
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
being forced to give up.

368
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,280
It's a delicate balance

369
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,720
between realism and idealism,

370
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
because now you

371
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,800
understand the most important

372
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,480
principle.

373
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,160
It depends on the circumstances.

374
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,200
Do what you can in the circumstances.

375
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,840
This is the proper philosophy for life.

376
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,240
She beat down both the attacks

377
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,960
from Team A and B in one blow!

378
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,440
Right, usually,

379
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,160
in the first round of speeches,

380
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,560
everyone will focus on

381
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,160
refuting one side

382
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,520
to create a partial advantage.

383
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,320
But with DUFE debating this way…

384
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,160
Aren't they just making trouble for themselves?

385
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,080
Or are they just too confident?

386
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,480
Should we try to take the floor?

387
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,240
Ma Nan.

388
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,280
Wait.

389
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,600
Do you think they should go for it?

390
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,880
I don't think they will.

391
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
Team C is antagonizing everyone.

392
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
The best method is to exploit the victory

393
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,520
and let Team B and C go first.

394
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,920
We should go for

395
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,720
the final spot to do the speech to

396
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,120
consolidate our advantage in this section.

397
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,000
So today,

398
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,920
our viewpoint is

399
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
that in life we must first

400
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,240
learn to leave it to fate.

401
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
Thank you.

402
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,520
We just said,

403
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,280
the norm in life is loss,

404
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,880
and with your side's leaving it to fate

405
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,440
an important prerequisite is

406
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,520
if fate doesn't allow me something,

407
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,440
I give up.

408
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,680
In your example of the

409
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,200
braised pork,

410
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,600
our side also argued to

411
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,760
let go of that pork that we

412
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,160
craved, didn't we?

413
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,520
And make rational choice

414
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
between the options.

415
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,960
Only then, you can go with your

416
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
"it depends on the situation"?

417
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
So this is our first point.

418
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,240
Letting go is a prerequisite.

419
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,120
Team B is focusing their attack on Team C.

420
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
Now's the time to act.

421
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,320
Why?

422
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,360
Shouldn't they let those two

423
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,680
tear each other apart?

424
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,520
If they give this chance

425
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,240
to Team C,

426
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,440
it'd be easy for them to make

427
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,400
a rebuttal.

428
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,760
Stealing the floor is basically

429
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,800
stealing the points of Team C.

430
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,120
Get it?

431
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,160
Got it.

432
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,280
My opponent said

433
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,200
letting go is a prerequisite of

434
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
going for it.

435
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
But if I

436
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,200
can't go for anything,

437
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,400
what do I have to let go of?

438
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,520
If my hands are empty,

439
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,600
am I letting go of thin air?

440
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,600
If we're hesitating at the

441
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,720
starting line,

442
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,760
let's take a look

443
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,560
at life's finish line.

444
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,760
Imagine,

445
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,480
in the twilight of our life, on our deathbed,

446
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,360
what are the things

447
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,080
that can make us calm

448
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
and we can let go of?

449
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,640
It's after we've achieved our dreams,

450
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
the trophies filling up the shelf,

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,320
it's after we've taken on responsibilities,

452
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,600
the grandchildren filling up the house.

453
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
Only if we keep

454
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,440
going for it again and again,

455
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,200
will we have these memories to look back on

456
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,320
and that true serenity.

457
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Life is like

458
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
beating a game.

459
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Some of the levels are really hard.

460
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
There are tough enemies that can

461
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
kill you in one hit.

462
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,240
What should we do?

463
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,200
Team B says let it go.

464
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,000
You can drop the game.

465
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,080
Team C would say to leave it to fate.

466
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,400
If you can't beat it, you can't beat it.

467
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,920
But,

468
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,680
I want to look at

469
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,040
the view in the next level,

470
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,520
because I know

471
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
it's there.

472
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,800
Liu Yanze, take it if you have the guts.

473
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,080
Team A presented

474
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,840
a very interesting example of

475
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,960
playing a game.

476
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,160
As a player,

477
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,040
you can, of course, choose

478
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,880
to fight an enemy to the death.

479
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
But as a child, a parent,

480
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,640
an employee, a boss?

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,640
Can we really

482
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,920
keep fighting, no matter what?

483
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,440
Is it really possible to

484
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,400
go for or to let go of

485
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,840
everything

486
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,240
as I please in this world?

487
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,440
Then there wouldn't be things we can't go for or can't let go of.

488
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
We must make the best of the situation.

489
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,920
"Grow beans beneath the southern mountains".

490
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,840
"Do not be pleased by your gains, or saddened by your losses".

491
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,360
That's not passivity.

492
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
It's the wisdom of survival.

493
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
He's confusing objective principles

494
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,000
with leaving things to fate.

495
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Shame on him.

496
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,720
"Grow beans beneath the southern mountains."

497
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,800
Tao Yuanming is all well and good.

498
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,760
"Do not be pleased by your gains, or saddened by your losses."

499
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,600
Fan Zhongyan, too.

500
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
But aren't they

501
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,320
different from our

502
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
adolescent state of mind?

503
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,320
Young people are empty-handed.

504
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,640
They want to develop, to build,

505
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,480
to take the things that they want,

506
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
to take it all.

507
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,720
This is normal.

508
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,640
Is Team B supporting us?

509
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,440
Isn't he

510
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,080
supporting our point of view?

511
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,440
They used our idea

512
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,800
first to object and

513
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,120
make a rebuttal,

514
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,160
then drive a wedge between us

515
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,240
and Team C.

516
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,440
They're just

517
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,520
putting pressure on us.

518
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,520
They've definitely got another trick up their sleeve.

519
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,240
But do the desires of life

520
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,560
have no finish line?

521
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,360
We hate not getting what we want.

522
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,040
We hate not being able to pursue what we want.

523
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,960
I stayed up all night studying,

524
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,240
why couldn't I get into

525
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,440
the university I wanted to?

526
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,560
I starve myself to get thin,

527
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,600
why haven't I lost

528
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
any weight at all?

529
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,560
Don't we deserve to

530
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
be rewarded for our efforts?

531
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
Do you see?

532
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,640
Your spirit will collapse.

533
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,680
Look, I was right.

534
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,680
If you say that going for it

535
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
helps us constantly

536
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,560
build our lives,

537
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,320
it's addition.

538
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,160
Then letting go

539
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,840
is stripping life

540
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,160
of unnecessary things.

541
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
It's subtraction.

542
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
This kind of stripping away and letting go

543
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,200
helps our lives become

544
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,320
simpler and purer.

545
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
It helps us to possess beauty of individuality.

546
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,600
But most importantly,

547
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,960
it helps us see clearly

548
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,280
what exactly is

549
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
important to us.

550
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,000
Thank you.

551
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,160
Team B took the initiative to get to

552
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,440
speak first in the last round.

553
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,800
Isn't that bad for them?

554
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,640
You know,

555
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,440
in tripartite debate,

556
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
contending for speeches

557
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,480
gets very intense.

558
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
The most important

559
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,920
thing is

560
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,800
who gets to go last

561
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,080
and sum up what their opponents have said.

562
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,600
So in previous competitions,

563
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,960
there have been times when

564
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,880
no one contends.

565
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,240
Then they're in trouble.

566
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,200
That's trouble,

567
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,320
but Team B was right

568
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
to do the speech first.

569
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,520
If you're the second last

570
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,680
to speak,

571
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,720
that's the worst.

572
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
Right now what's crucial

573
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,120
is whether

574
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,360
Team C steals the floor

575
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,800
to make a rebuttal on Team B

576
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
and get revenge.

577
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,880
Plan failed.

578
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,040
Hello everyone.

579
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,160
We might as well

580
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,840
follow Team B's speech

581
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,760
by saying

582
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
have we young people

583
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,880
really overburdened

584
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,600
our lives with

585
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,760
weighty responsibilities?

586
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,040
It doesn't seem like it.

587
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,680
In the rapidly developing world of today.

588
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,080
young people, one after another,

589
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,840
keep saying "whatever"

590
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,800
"sure" and "it doesn't matter".

591
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,040
Meaning, worth, dreams, hopes,

592
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,880
are things that they avoid,

593
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,080
words they don't talk about.

594
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,720
And then they feel satisfied

595
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,960
curled up in their corners.

596
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,040
In Japan,

597
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
this means low-desire society.

598
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,720
In the West, this is a lost generation.

599
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Cynicism rules. There is no longer any meaning.

600
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,720
Young people are giving up.

601
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,760
They're all leaving it to fate.

602
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,720
So who's going for it?

603
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,280
So, you're right,

604
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,240
our point of view means

605
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
always going for more.

606
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,280
We will throw ourselves

607
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
into our careers.

608
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,960
In love,

609
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,080
we want to jump in headfirst.

610
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,560
We'll go out into the world to find our fortune.

611
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,160
That's our perspective.

612
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
Because today's world

613
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
still needs every one of us

614
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,960
to have the skills, duties and responsibilities,

615
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
to go for it.

616
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,600
Thank you.

617
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,120
Not bad.

618
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,480
What we're discussing today

619
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,280
are attitudes to life.

620
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Team A said to want more.

621
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
Our lives are about

622
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,120
addition.

623
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Team B said

624
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,040
letting go is a kind of stripping.

625
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,240
When the unnecessary are stripped away,

626
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,040
life has meaning.

627
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,080
It's about concentration.

628
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,040
It's like the question of whether it's better

629
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,320
to have a huge portion of seafood soup

630
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,560
or one that's delicious and beautifully presented?

631
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,600
The answer is,

632
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,120
it depends on if we're hungry.

633
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,520
If one day I'm tired,

634
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,200
and my belly is grumbling,

635
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,480
then volume is

636
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,040
more important.

637
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,360
But if I have a date with a girl,

638
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,640
and I carefully prepared,

639
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,200
then its flavor and appearance become

640
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,080
paramount.

641
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,360
After all, if I take my dates to

642
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
a food stall that serves big portions,

643
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,880
it'd be easy for me to stay single forever.

644
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,280
Leaving it to fate is not a passive life.

645
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,920
It's not about just getting by.

646
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,880
If you know what's just right for the situation

647
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,480
then you can make

648
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,440
every day part of

649
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,480
a wonderful life amidst the

650
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,000
chaos of this world.

651
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,880
Thank you.

652
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,800
We still don't know what

653
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,720
their score is now.

654
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
I have a way.

655
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,840
So?

656
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,960
We're at 18 points.

657
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Team C has 17.

658
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,360
We have one more than them!

659
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,840
We have one more than them!

660
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,080
Liu Yanze isn't targeting us.

661
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm not surprised.

662
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,080
Although the tactic failed,

663
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,360
at least we're still ahead in the scores.

664
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,680
We got the opening down.

665
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,800
We'll see what happens in the rebuttal.

666
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,480
This part is more about strategy.

667
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,080
Thank you to our three teams for

668
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,240
their excellent speeches.

669
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,320
Sure enough, during the first section,

670
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,400
they've all been going head-to-head

671
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,920
against each other.

672
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
So next up is our

673
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,720
rebuttal section.

674
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,000
This time we'll begin with Team A.

675
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
Choose any team

676
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,160
or two teams to do the rebuttal.

677
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,480
There will be three rounds, each one two minutes.

678
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,440
Go ahead, Team A.

679
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,240
Xiaoyu will choose Team C.

680
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,760
I choose Team C.

681
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,680
Again.

682
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,480
Hello, my opponent.

683
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,200
Hello.

684
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,160
Between leaving it to fate and going for it,

685
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,120
which one is more likely

686
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
to get us love?

687
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,440
What does your side think?

688
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,760
Going for it, obviously.

689
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
Those who are willing to bravely chase after love

690
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,240
are the ones who deserve it, right?

691
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,840
Yin Nan can turn the attack

692
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,640
around in one sentence!

693
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,320
How did Xiaoyu get it in her way again?

694
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,960
But it's no good if you force it.

695
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,920
What's the use of

696
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
courage alone?

697
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,480
I said that we must first go for it.

698
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,440
Whether it works

699
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,320
obviously depends on whether the two people

700
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,280
are compatible or not.

701
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,360
Compatibility is important, of course.

702
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,280
But sometimes people who are compatible

703
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,400
are millions of miles apart,

704
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,640
and maybe not able to meet.

705
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
If you can't meet them,

706
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,160
then does your problem

707
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,320
not exist at all?

708
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
When two compatible people

709
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,400
just happen to meet,

710
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,320
what do we usually

711
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,600
call that?

712
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,480
We call it…

713
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,680
Fate, right?

714
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,040
So doesn't fate come first,

715
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,560
before we can go for it?

716
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,760
She fell for it again.

717
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
Déjà vu.

718
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Get used to it.

719
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,760
That's fine.

720
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,720
Let's go to the next question.

721
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,640
What do you think is the essence

722
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,480
of going for it?

723
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,840
It's a can-do attitude.

724
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,600
But I don't know what the essence of

725
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,320
leaving it to fate is.

726
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,160
The essence of leaving it to fate is

727
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,080
not assuming anything.

728
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,160
If going for it is bravely trying something,

729
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,360
then are all things you can try

730
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
worthy of encouragement?

731
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,840
No.

732
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,480
But I believe that in the face

733
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
of all life's opportunities,

734
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,680
bravely trying something is a good thing.

735
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,360
What if this opportunity is

736
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,480
something bad?

737
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,320
So it depends

738
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,200
on what the opportunity is, right?

739
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,880
Before the opportunity appears

740
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,560
there's no way to try it, right?

741
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,800
So?

742
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,760
That's exactly what my side said,

743
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,880
not making assumptions,

744
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,360
leaving it to fate.

745
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Thank you.

746
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,800
Next is Team B's turn

747
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,640
for the rebuttal.

748
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,120
You also have two minutes.

749
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,960
Please.

750
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,720
I choose Team C.

751
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,080
How do leaving it to fate and letting go

752
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,240
differ?

753
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,960
Letting go

754
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,880
is about immediately resigning yourself

755
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
to something.

756
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,600
Leaving it to fate is the surprise when "there seems no road beyond,

757
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,040
and among the willows and flowers another village appears".

758
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,160
OK, then please tell me

759
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,280
if Xiaoming doesn't do well in a test,

760
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,240
and tells himself, "it's fine,

761
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,320
I'll leave the score to fate,"

762
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,920
how is that different from letting it go?

763
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,840
Xiaoming is only burying

764
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,680
his head in the sand.

765
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,520
Do you think

766
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,400
letting go and deceiving yourself

767
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,080
are the same thing?

768
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,640
I understand…

769
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,360
It doesn't seem like it.

770
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,040
In the same way,

771
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,000
leaving it to fate is about

772
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,480
making the best decision

773
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,320
in the circumstances.

774
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,800
If Xiaoming hadn't deceived himself,

775
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,640
and chosen to accept his current

776
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,240
failure,

777
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,200
and thought he had a better

778
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,600
chance to

779
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,480
plan out his future studies, that

780
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,840
would be leaving it to fate.

781
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,280
I understand what your side means by leaving it to fate,

782
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,920
it's to make us

783
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,760
react without

784
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,960
any emotion and from a

785
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,040
purely objective standpoint.

786
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,120
No, it's about reason.

787
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,360
Leaving it to fate isn't without emotion,

788
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
and it's not driven by pure emotion either.

789
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,400
It's about using reason to analyze situations

790
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,560
and make choices.

791
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,800
Ma Nan.

792
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,400
I suddenly thought of a problem.

793
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,360
What problem?

794
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,040
Team C's point.

795
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,400
What's wrong?

796
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,600
Team C's argument is so simple that

797
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,160
apart from the definition, they have no points.

798
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,960
Their definition of leaving it to fate

799
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,360
is not assuming anything.

800
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,520
To judge according to the circumstances.

801
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,880
And their point

802
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,800
is precisely that

803
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,360
adapting to circumstances

804
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,960
is the best philosophy

805
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,160
in life.

806
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,880
That's…

807
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,040
So sly of them.

808
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,600
I'll do it.

809
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,920
Maybe I should do it.

810
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm more familiar with the argument structure.

811
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,800
I'll do it.

812
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,200
OK.

813
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,000
Next is the final round of inquiries.

814
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,760
Go ahead, Team C.

815
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,000
I want to rebut

816
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,200
Team A and Team B.

817
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,640
No way!

818
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
Is that against the rules?

819
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,000
It's not.

820
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,240
But, it's very rare.

821
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,040
Team A and B are likely

822
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,960
to come together to

823
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
refute Team C.

824
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,160
Right, this will be fun.

825
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,840
Viewers,

826
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,000
today's competition

827
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,600
is great value for money.

828
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
Amazing!

829
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,200
So, please scan the QR code

830
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
on the screen and

831
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
become a Dry Mango Video member.

832
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,320
There's a 20% discount right now.

833
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,680
Team A,

834
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,480
is it possible to go for

835
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,280
everything in life?

836
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,400
My side means that you must

837
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,440
first go for something to be able to let it go

838
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,200
and leave it to fate,

839
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,520
so most things are like that.

840
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Team B,

841
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,960
is it possible to let everything go?

842
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,600
It's not.

843
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,960
My side is saying we must first learn to let go

844
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
in order to face life better.

845
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,640
Then, Team A,

846
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
how can you go for the letting go

847
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,360
Team B describes?

848
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Team B, how can you let go of

849
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,880
the going for it that Team A describes?

850
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,520
That's simple,

851
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,200
my side would just go for

852
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,520
Team B's letting go.

853
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,200
So Team A's going for it is wrong.

854
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,960
My side is also trying to convince them

855
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
to learn to let go.

856
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,160
But life is often about going for something

857
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,080
and letting go.

858
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,080
There appears to be no space for your side's

859
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,160
leaving it to fate.

860
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,600
My side agrees with this perspective.

861
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
In this round, why don't we two

862
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,680
go against each other,

863
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,280
and Team C just leave it to fate?

864
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,840
I'm sure both sides have heard before

865
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,120
the story of Sisyphus.

866
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
He was punished by the gods

867
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,920
to push a huge rock up a mountain,

868
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,320
but as soon as the rock reached the top

869
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,800
it would slide back down the mountain,

870
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,720
endlessly going back and forth

871
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
between going for it and letting go,

872
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,880
just like what Team A and B agreed.

873
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
Are you sure this painful life

874
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,600
is what we're pursuing?

875
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,120
That's just your opinion.

876
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,800
Camus's play

877
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,840
"Sisyphus"

878
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,800
criticizes this kind of

879
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,480
nihilistic attitude.

880
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,640
And like Sisyphus,

881
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,800
fighting against the

882
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
tragedies of fate and

883
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,560
absurdities of life.

884
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,360
That in itself gives life

885
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
a noble value.

886
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,240
Why must our lives be

887
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,440
so tragic?

888
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
Is living a normal life

889
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,160
necessarily cowardice?

890
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,680
So Team B rejects this moral abduction.

891
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,840
Team A doesn't want

892
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,280
young people to give up fighting.

893
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,880
So actually

894
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,680
both sides are

895
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,600
telling us

896
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
that leaving it to fate is the best

897
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,760
choice for most young people.

898
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,320
Right?

899
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,000
No, because…

900
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
Amazing!

901
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,560
He did a rebuttal on both sides,

902
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,920
and still won.

903
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,480
To be honest,

904
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
I've seen thousands of debates,

905
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
but I've never seen this before.

906
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,600
The advantages of their speeches have been levelled.

907
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,360
And the inquiry strategy of this round

908
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,640
was totally lost to the other side.

909
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,000
We're at 16 points.

910
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,280
Team C has 18 points.

911
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,720
Team B has 14.

912
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,440
It all rests on the free debate.

913
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,880
That's fine, we just need to keep steady.

914
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,280
Next we'll move into the

915
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,200
nerve-wracking and intense

916
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,480
free debate section.

917
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
In this section each team

918
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,560
will speak for three minutes.

919
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,600
Each side can speak freely

920
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,640
until their time runs out.

921
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,440
First, we'll ask Team B

922
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,520
to begin. Please.

923
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,640
Zhuangzi said: "It's a thing,

924
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,080
that accompanies all others,

925
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,960
when they are overthrown

926
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,640
and obtain completion.

927
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,120
It's tranquility,

928
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,760
amid all disturbances,

929
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
that lead to its perfection".

930
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,360
My opponents,

931
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,120
isn't this a kind

932
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,320
of higher realm?

933
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,200
My opponent,

934
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,160
please use modern Chinese

935
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,720
to translate.

936
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,200
Is a translation needed?

937
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,520
According to your opinion, you can

938
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,920
leave it to fate whether you understand or not.

939
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,320
Starting off with Zhuangzi.

940
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,280
It didn't get much of a reaction from the audience.

941
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,320
Maybe they slipped up.

942
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
A good debater perhaps shouldn't

943
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,000
rely too much on literary quotes.

944
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,600
The higher the realm

945
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,360
the longer it takes to reach.

946
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Hasn't my opponent forgotten

947
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,400
that our debate question is how

948
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,960
we should

949
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,160
live the first

950
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,080
part of our lives?

951
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
You're saying we shouldn't

952
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,120
assume too much,

953
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,280
but also ask everyone to assume

954
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,320
an attitude-less attitude.

955
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,160
Aren't you

956
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,920
self-contradictory?

957
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,000
A double negative means a yes,

958
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,720
my fellow debater.

959
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,320
Zhuangzi's philosophy is to recover one's original simplicity.

960
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,440
Why can't this become

961
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,720
our guide to life?

962
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,240
Isn't Mencius's "I go against thousands"

963
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,920
a kind of go-for-it

964
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,640
attitude?

965
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,680
The Confucianism of Confucius and Mencius

966
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,640
ruled in China for two thousand years.

967
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,560
May I ask what Zhuangzi's theory

968
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,120
was doing then?

969
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,960
Isn't Mencius's bravery

970
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,040
based upon letting go

971
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,240
of one's own fame and fortune

972
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,560
and even life itself?

973
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,880
That's still letting go first, right?

974
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,080
According to what Team B says,

975
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
daring to move forward is

976
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,960
letting go of what's behind you.

977
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,680
Daring to work hard

978
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,240
is letting go of comfort.

979
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,520
So going for it is always

980
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,440
letting go in disguise?

981
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,320
Then can we say that

982
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,000
letting go is also

983
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,680
going for it?

984
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,840
So stop fighting, you two.

985
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,320
Leaving it to fate leads.

986
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Like finding a partner,

987
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,760
isn't it mostly about fate?

988
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,040
She's so cocky. She's asking for a fight.

989
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,760
My fellow debater,

990
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,800
today we're talking about

991
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,560
the big things in life,

992
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,080
please don't get hung up on things like

993
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,880
finding a partner.

994
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,520
If you don't find a partner,

995
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
your genes will end

996
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,760
with you.

997
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,040
My fellow debater,

998
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,680
you might not know that

999
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,480
the ratio of men to women in China

1000
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
is 117 to 100.

1001
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,240
That means for every

1002
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,880
117 men

1003
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,960
17 of them will be single.

1004
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
My opponent, you leave it to fate,

1005
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,320
and you'll be alone!

1006
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,760
I think that makes a lot of sense.

1007
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,320
Going for it is a kind of trying something.

1008
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,800
If you never try, you'll never know.

1009
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,960
If everything must be

1010
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,480
tried once,

1011
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,320
my opponent probably needs

1012
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,760
another 500 years to do it.

1013
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Who has that many opportunities

1014
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,720
for trials and errors in their lives?

1015
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,600
I have a friend who

1016
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,240
used to be very afraid

1017
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,080
of the 800-meter running test.

1018
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,840
But when she finally

1019
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,800
went for it,

1020
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,880
she was able to pass it.

1021
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,080
What's wrong with pushing

1022
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,760
yourself in life?

1023
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,080
But as the upper limits are being pushed,

1024
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,320
so are our lower limits.

1025
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,280
How many people cheat in order to get a better score

1026
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,080
and are eventually kicked out of school?

1027
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,160
My opponent, pushing yourself

1028
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,760
will eventually get you in trouble.

1029
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
We're talking about how we should act

1030
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,560
at the start of our lives.

1031
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,200
But what for?

1032
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,880
What is the true meaning of life?

1033
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,800
Everyone has different

1034
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,200
goals in life,

1035
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,320
but we have to let go

1036
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,960
in order to find

1037
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
true freedom.

1038
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,200
Our goals in life are different,

1039
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,120
the flexibility of leaving it to fate

1040
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,880
allow for the variability of people's experiences.

1041
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,840
Isn't it the most suitable?

1042
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,120
"Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,

1043
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,320
all happy families are alike".

1044
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Your side can't just look at the similarities,

1045
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,120
and not the dissimilarities.

1046
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Surely your side isn't pursuing

1047
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,840
unhappiness?

1048
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,760
All roads lead to Rome.

1049
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,040
Rome is Rome,

1050
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,400
but if you're in the West, you need to go East,

1051
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,720
if you're in the South you can't keep going South.

1052
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,920
The path to happiness

1053
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,320
depends on your situation.

1054
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,280
If you don't leave it to fate,

1055
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,000
you might end up

1056
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,520
further and further away from Rome.

1057
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Oh my!

1058
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,120
I'm out of breath.

1059
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,600
They're evenly matched in the free debate.

1060
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,000
Looking at the whole competition,

1061
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,760
only Teams A and C have the

1062
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,400
strength to contend for the first prize.

1063
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,160
Right.

1064
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,400
Team C

1065
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,040
has a slight edge.

1066
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Let's see next if they

1067
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,120
can consolidate their positions

1068
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,200
in the closing arguments.

1069
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,840
So, who wins the prize…

1070
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,120
Depends on the closing arguments.

1071
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,080
I can't see. It's blocked.

1072
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,360
There are still the closing arguments.

1073
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,680
We still have hope.

1074
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,120
But their

1075
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
closing argument

1076
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,360
will be made by Liu Yanze.

1077
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,040
Everybody makes mistakes.

1078
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,440
After this

1079
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,520
lively battle of words,

1080
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,840
next up is

1081
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,040
the last section

1082
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,080
of the competition,

1083
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,880
closing arguments.

1084
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,640
Closing arguments will begin with Team C.

1085
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,160
Each side has three minutes, please begin.

1086
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,120
I'm sorry.

1087
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
Our motion today

1088
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,760
isn't an inspiring

1089
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,160
battle cry

1090
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,800
and it can't bring you

1091
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,280
calm in the face of defeat.

1092
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,240
We seem to only be able to tell everyone,

1093
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,240
no matter if you win or lose

1094
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,720
it's all down to fate.

1095
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,960
Today the go-for-it side has

1096
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,360
been telling us to challenge,

1097
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,240
to break through, to redefine.

1098
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,520
It makes me think that they're

1099
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,760
capable of taking the Monkey King's weapon

1100
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,560
and sweep away the corruption of the world.

1101
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,240
The letting-go side has

1102
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,960
been telling us

1103
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,160
to accept, to acknowledge,

1104
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,520
to face the moment calmly.

1105
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,440
It makes me think

1106
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,160
they're capable of letting go of all attachments,

1107
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
and becoming a Buddha.

1108
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,280
I'm confident that

1109
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,360
after today's competition,

1110
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,080
some of you here will

1111
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,600
choose going for it

1112
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,960
or letting go.

1113
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,400
But what happens when these emotions recede?

1114
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,840
In the dead of night,

1115
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,040
can you really pick up a book

1116
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,760
and focus on studying

1117
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,000
until four in the morning?

1118
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,800
Will you wake up one night

1119
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,560
and be able to break ties with someone you love,

1120
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,480
and let go of that person

1121
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,520
who's been with you for so long?

1122
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,840
For the things we go for and let go in this world,

1123
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,480
can we truly see the results

1124
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,760
in the moment

1125
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,960
we decide to act?

1126
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Have you realized?

1127
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,800
Holding the Monkey King's weapon

1128
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,360
doesn't mean you can sweep away the corruption of the world.

1129
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,640
Letting go of attachments doesn't mean

1130
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,960
you'll become a Buddha.

1131
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,080
My fellow debaters believe that

1132
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,800
if you go for it, you'll succeed,

1133
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,680
if you let go, you can shuffle off this mortal coil.

1134
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,440
But it's exactly the disappointment of life

1135
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,200
that we can only see

1136
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,120
the start,

1137
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,280
but not the results.

1138
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,240
The bumps on the road.

1139
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,720
All the sufferings.

1140
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,520
At the start,

1141
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,840
we can't see them at all.

1142
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,240
In today's competition,

1143
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
we've been tantalized by verses,

1144
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
brainwashed by chicken soup for the soul,

1145
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,040
encouraged by slogans.

1146
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,840
But our judgement has also

1147
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,640
been paralyzed.

1148
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,440
I'm confident that among those sitting here

1149
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
there are those who can go for it

1150
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,520
and let go,

1151
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,720
but there are certainly also those

1152
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,080
who can't go for it or let go.

1153
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,920
Since that's the case,

1154
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,960
the successes reaped from going for it

1155
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,560
are the trophies of only some,

1156
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,640
the calm that comes from letting go

1157
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,800
is also only the domain of

1158
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,640
some of us?

1159
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,560
Those who chose to listen

1160
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,680
to the admonishments of Team A and B,

1161
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,560
to chase these ends of

1162
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,720
going for it and letting go

1163
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,520
are merely using someone else's map,

1164
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,320
to travel in their own country.

1165
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,040
This guide

1166
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,720
leads you home

1167
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,840
but doesn't point out my path.

1168
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,120
In life there's another time, another place

1169
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,480
and right now and here.

1170
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,440
Every landscape is worthy of

1171
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,560
being treated with an

1172
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,880
appropriate attitude.

1173
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,320
But that requires us to

1174
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,480
not make prejudgments

1175
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,880
before we encounter it.

1176
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,600
That's leaving it to fate.

1177
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,560
There are many kinds of brilliant

1178
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,680
lives in this world.

1179
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,120
But there's only one kind of desolation.

1180
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,120
That's following other people's stories,

1181
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,520
and not living your own life.

1182
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,760
Thank you.

1183
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,920
I have the results of this competition

1184
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,480
right here.

1185
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,840
I'm here to announce

1186
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,120
that the winner of this competition

1187
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,000
is Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics Team!

1188
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,800
Congratulation.

1189
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,040
That was a great performance.

1190
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,920
Your points were great.

1191
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,640
Alright.

1192
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,120
You guys and Team C

1193
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,400
were neck and neck today.

1194
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,600
Besides,

1195
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,240
this year we'll get enough experience

1196
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,640
and try again next year.

1197
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,640
Right?

1198
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,200
Do you want some milk tea?

1199
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,640
Hot pot?

1200
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,320
Fried chicken?

1201
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,160
Yeah?

1202
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,560
I'm fine.

1203
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,120
I'm just a little tired.

1204
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,280
I just need to go back to the dorm and sleep.

1205
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,480
Yeah.

1206
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,960
You're so strong. I'm sure you're fine.

1207
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,120
If you need anything just

1208
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,520
come to the boys' dorm and get me.

1209
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,240
I know.

1210
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,680
We did pretty well today.

1211
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,520
What a pity.

1212
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,520
Just do your best.
