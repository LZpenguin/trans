00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,580
Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP26

2
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,480
Spring awakens apricot branches.

3
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,960
A happy couple comes to us.

4
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,360
The happy bride

5
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
wearing a beautiful

6
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
white wedding dress

7
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,840
has come to

8
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,920
our wedding scene.

9
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,400
She comes to us happily

10
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,560
It's all right.

11
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,720
It doesn't matter.

12
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,200
with a smile on her face.

13
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,160
All right.

14
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,520
The bride is coming.

15
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,400
I don't dare to look.

16
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,040
All right.

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,080
Xiaoyu, Hao

18
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
It's all right.

19
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,000
Umm.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
She's not Xiaoyu.

21
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,600
How do you know that?

22
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,840
Xiaoyu walks with her legs facing outward.

23
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,440
She walks

24
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,280
like a model.

25
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,480
Who are you talking about?

26
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,720
Oh.

27
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,800
I know you can't let me go.

28
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,000
The world is full of happiness

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,840
at this moment.

30
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,120
The earth...

31
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,880
What's going on?

32
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,520
The bride returns by herself.

33
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,800
She has a serious quarrel with her parents.

34
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
She says she must get married.

35
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,000
That's right.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,680
Anyway,

37
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,680
you just love

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,240
and care about me.

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,440
I don't love you.

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,920
For the birth of this new family,

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,640
they bring...

42
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,240
Umm.

43
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,840
What do you like about me?

44
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,400
Symbolizes

45
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,160
sincerity.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Everything.

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,080
You're perfunctory.

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,600
Please.

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,960
Send their

50
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,280
token of love.

51
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,840
Thank you.

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,640
I'll eat this.

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,200
Ah.

54
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,280
Your body fat

55
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
is on the high side.

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,600
The doctor advises you to keep a bland diet.

57
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Eating habits

58
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,760
are difficult to change

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,360
once they are formed.

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,240
So

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,320
let me prepare

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,160
your three meals every day.

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,520
You don't have to make breakfast.

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,920
Well.

65
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's have lunch and dinner

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,120
together.

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
The boundless sky and endless earth may pass away,

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,760
but this vow unfulfilled will be regretted for aye.

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
A small

70
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,520
diamond ring

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,840
guards

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,400
their love

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,520
for each other.

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,880
Let's bless the newlywed.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
It's mine.

76
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,520
Left.

77
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,640
This way.

78
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
Nan Bei, you are wonderful.

79
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,320
Cheers.

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
It's too hard.

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
It's too hard to get married.

82
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
There are so many people.

83
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,880
It's really hard.

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,960
You don't know.

85
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,760
No, thanks.

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,240
Give it to me.

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,560
Xiaoyu, please persuade him.

88
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,600
Why do you wear it again?

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,280
Don't think too much.

90
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,120
I tried on wedding dresses for them.

91
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,960
Then they gave me the wedding dress

92
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,520
after altering it

93
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,720
according to my size.

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
So I put it on.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,240
Don't be angry.

96
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,440
All right, I promise to

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
let you go to

98
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,760
the Internet cafe all night once a month.

99
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,000
You can also buy game equipment at will.

100
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,960
You're not angry?

101
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm not

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
petty at all.

103
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,800
It doesn't matter at all.

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
I don't care at all.

105
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,240
I'll treat it as charity.

106
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
But

107
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,480
let me do this kind of thing

108
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,840
in the future.

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,760
OK.

110
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,800
Umm.

111
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,000
Xiaoyu

112
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,160
You'd better

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,800
give them this dress back.

114
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,200
In the future,

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
I'll definitely buy you a big one.

116
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,240
Nan Bei

117
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,680
I'll change it.

118
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,040
You look especially good in this.

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,680
This is very strange.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,880
No, we're a good match.

121
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,680
If we get married,

122
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
it will be a second marriage.

123
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,760
Its wedding ceremony has to be held at noon.

124
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,840
Stop it.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,960
You should wear a pink wedding dress when you get remarried.

126
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,920
Ah.

127
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,080
It is held at different times

128
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,640
depending on the place,

129
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,560
with some being held in the morning

130
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
and others in the afternoon.

131
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,240
You know?

132
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,760
Implementation measures

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,120
of Kaili City for standardizing the behavior

134
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,280
of handling catering.

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,240
Ah.

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,920
Do you think

137
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,160
we can debate

138
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,000
about remarriage without catering?

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,360
Do you...

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,880
Right.

141
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
Do I...

142
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,760
Right.

143
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,440
Too young.

144
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,040
We haven't had noodles in a long time.

145
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,840
Hello, everyone.

146
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,960
The annual provincial debate league

147
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
is about to kick off.

148
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,480
After six months of fierce competition,

149
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,200
the university will have two debate teams

150
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,280
participating in this league.

151
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,880
It is worth noting

152
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,280
that the school debate team

153
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,080
led by Liu Yanze,

154
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
president of the student union,

155
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,280
has lived up to your expectations.

156
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,040
They have been undefeated

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,800
since the provincial points competition.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The other team

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,480
is originally the second school team.

160
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
They left the team for some reason in the points competition.

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,880
Then they successfully

162
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,640
entered the league

163
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,760
as an independent social team.

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,120
Hello.

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Everyone,

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
good morning.

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Good afternoon.

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,160
Good evening.

169
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
Welcome to the campus radio.

170
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm Shan Dan.

171
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,360
First of all, let me announce a piece of good news.

172
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
The only two debate team in our university

173
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,440
have entered the second stage

174
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,320
of the provincial competition.

175
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,160
Their strengths are obvious to all.

176
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Of course.

177
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,040
Among them, the most likely to win

178
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
is the high-profile

179
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,800
Team 235.

180
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,280
This team is not afraid of larger powers

181
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,200
and struggles hard amid difficulties.

182
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
They are simply the best

183
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,120
of the dark horses.

184
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,720
The leader of this team is Nan Bei.

185
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,520
He is not only the handsome Ares of DUFE,

186
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,840
but also Mu Xiaoyu's boyfriend.

187
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
Under his leadership,

188
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
this team is sure to beat team one.

189
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,640
Oh, no.

190
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,760
It will definitely go hand in hand

191
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,280
with team one

192
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,880
to create good results.

193
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,880
Although team two has also entered the league,

194
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,880
the strength of the teams entering the second stage

195
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,800
is generally higher than

196
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,680
that of the first stage.

197
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
Therefore, as a social team,

198
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
its competition prospect is still slim.

199
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,680
It's not like team one.

200
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,240
You're right.

201
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,680
Team one has been in the greenhouse for a long time,

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,560
so its strength and vision

203
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
are limited.

204
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,920
The second team has been fighting outside for so long,

205
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,280
so its strength and vision

206
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
have been improved rapidly.

207
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
Team one

208
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
was runner-up in last year's provincial competition.

209
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,720
Team two didn't even

210
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,600
enter the provincial competition.

211
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
To be honest,

212
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,040
if there is no team two to help team one

213
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
play the points competition,

214
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,840
team one may not be able to enter the provincial competition.

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
Team two has always

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
lost to team one.

217
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,000
Isn't it obvious

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
who is the winner?

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,240
Of course, team two is the best.

220
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Why does team one...

221
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Mao, why are you here?

222
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,240
Have you reviewed the press release?

223
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,160
You talk nonsense.

224
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,480
Mao

225
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,160
You are so naughty.

226
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,920
I haven't turned it off yet.

227
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,680
You piss me off.

228
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't be angry.

229
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,240
The league is stationed

230
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
at the five-star Xinghua Hotel.

231
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,040
All the contestants will

232
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,160
stay here one after another.

233
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,560
Follow-up competitions

234
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,080
will be broadcast live on the network.

235
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Coming soon.

236
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,840
Xiaoyu, look.

237
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,400
This hotel has the highest score.

238
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,600
Its breakfast is a buffet.

239
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,680
There are celebrities who have lived here.

240
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
That's great.

241
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,080
Who did it?

242
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,880
Who threw the material under the table

243
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,600
when he couldn't finish revising it?

244
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Ah.

245
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,080
Please admit your mistake at once.

246
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,920
I'll put these

247
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,560
outside.

248
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,960
Do you pack so much

249
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
to quit the team?

250
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,360
What?

251
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,240
If we stay in the hotel,

252
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,760
we can't waste

253
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,400
our time here.

254
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,800
Be a man.

255
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Please help me pack.

256
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,880
My legs hurt. I have a gout attack.

257
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,160
Three.

258
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
Two.

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,800
All right.

260
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,360
Xiaoyu

261
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,960
There is a popular

262
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,000
Chongqing old hot pot restaurant

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,880
next to this hotel.

264
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,280
I've long wanted to go.

265
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,880
We are there to compete,

266
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
not to play.

267
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,040
Never forget who you are.

268
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,360
Dango

269
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,760
There's something more appealing

270
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,800
than the five-star hotel.

271
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,200
What? Crawfish buffet?

272
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,520
Liu Yanze is also in that hotel.

273
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,600
We should concentrate on the competition and not be distracted.

274
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,080
Xiaoyu

275
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,760
Do you think we'll

276
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,680
live next door to them?

277
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,840
Go away, please concentrate on

278
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,600
reviewing.

279
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,840
If Hao knows, she'll be angry.

280
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Did Hao see it?

281
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,880
No.

282
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,040
Please check it again.

283
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,200
How can there be no room for us?

284
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,680
Right.

285
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,360
I already said

286
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,240
that the competition committee

287
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,080
didn't book your rooms.

288
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
There can't be no room for us here.

289
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,680
We really

290
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,640
are the team for this competition.

291
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,560
I have the invitation to the event

292
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,480
from the organizing committee.

293
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,960
Please check it again.

294
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,280
You've seen it three times.

295
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,840
There's really no your team here.

296
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Please check it again.

297
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,480
Did you get our name wrong?

298
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,280
Our name is Team 235.

299
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,440
Thank you, please.

300
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
Please check it again.

301
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,800
All the teams are here.

302
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,160
There's really no your team here.

303
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,960
Please wait a moment.

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,480
Well.

305
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,920
What's the matter?

306
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,640
They are the team for this competition.

307
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
But the hotel doesn't

308
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,800
reserve rooms for them.

309
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,960
Please.

310
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,400
He is

311
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,720
the logistics director of this competition.

312
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,680
If you have anything, you can ask him.

313
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,600
Hello.

314
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,080
Hello.

315
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,360
Which university do you come from?

316
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,640
Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics

317
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,360
The team of DUFE has already checked in.

318
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,560
No, we

319
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,800
don't represent the university.

320
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
We are the social team,

321
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,320
Team 235.

322
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,160
Social team.

323
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,480
Right.

324
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,080
Please listen to me.

325
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,240
We have

326
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,000
limited rooms this time.

327
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,400
So the organizing committee stipulates

328
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,480
that it is not responsible for the accommodation of the social team.

329
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,480
So you're not

330
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
on this check-in list.

331
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,040
But,

332
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,480
among dozens of teams,

333
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,320
why is it only not responsible for

334
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,680
the accommodation of the two social teams?

335
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,160
Right.

336
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,800
This is formulated by the organizing committee.

337
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
Have you seen the competition statistics?

338
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,520
Our team is the first

339
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
in the number of competitions

340
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,680
among all the competition teams.

341
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,760
And we win

342
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,880
the only AI competition.

343
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,200
This is the rule.

344
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,760
So is there any other way?

345
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,200
I'm really sorry.

346
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,120
We really don't have

347
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,800
any other ways here.

348
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm off to take a taxi.

349
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,600
Could you please see

350
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,920
if Nanjiang Drama Academy has checked in.

351
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,080
It hasn't yet.

352
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,360
Thank you.

353
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Why?

354
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
We've entered the provincial competition.

355
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,040
They still look down on us.

356
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,000
Right. Everyone

357
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,840
wins by strength.

358
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,360
Why do they look down on us

359
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,120
and treat us differently?

360
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,560
Umm.

361
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,800
In fact,

362
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,880
it is inconvenient

363
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
for us to live together

364
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,400
in a hotel.

365
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
After all,

366
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,240
we can save

367
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,120
a lot of time

368
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
on the road.

369
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,560
I have

370
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,400
the car

371
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,880
to take you there and bring you back.

372
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,920
We are sure to be late.

373
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,280
He's also right to think so.

374
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,440
Social team sounds

375
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,600
richer than students.

376
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,920
It's okay for them to arrange it this way.

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,200
How rich the school team is.

378
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,640
Dango

379
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,880
Ask Liu Yanze

380
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,800
what else

381
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,560
we can take advantage of.

382
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,160
No.

383
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,120
Please ask him yourself.

384
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,560
I didn't handle this matter well.

385
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,360
I'm

386
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
sorry for you all.

387
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,080
Hao, please don't be angry with him.

388
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,360
He doesn't mean that.

389
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,840
Hao, this has nothing to do with you either.

390
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm also angry.

391
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,560
Up to now,

392
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,760
we are no worse than any other team

393
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,400
in terms of strength and experience.

394
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,520
But as a leader,

395
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,640
I can't even win

396
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,280
the most basic fair treatment.

397
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,520
Hao

398
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,720
We don't blame you.

399
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,760
So blame it

400
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,600
on Sa.

401
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,040
Ah.

402
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,560
Right, blame it on Sa.

403
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:54,880
Right.

404
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,840
Hao, don't

405
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,520
take it so seriously.

406
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,520
We are all students.

407
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,720
It's normal that we can't handle it.

408
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,360
It's a shame that the teacher can't handle it.

409
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Right, I'm ashamed.

410
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm indeed ashamed.

411
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,600
I just feel sorry for you.

412
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
You don't need to apologize.

413
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,240
Now that it's done,

414
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,760
we should work harder

415
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
to get back

416
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,080
the fairness and respect we deserve.

417
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
What does our team

418
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
do best?

419
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,360
Be back in the saddle.

420
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,080
Right.

421
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,760
Hao, don't worry.

422
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,920
I'll definitely make them pay for

423
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,840
their foolishness.

424
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,840
Right.

425
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,800
Let's start

426
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,480
preparing for it.

427
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,280
Please believe us.

428
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,160
Why doesn't Sa

429
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,120
join us?

430
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,280
He says he'll go to

431
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,000
meet a friend at the hotel.

432
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,280
He waits for us at the hotel.

433
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,400
I heard that there are many

434
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,480
brain boxes of the debate circle in a while.

435
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Really?

436
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,040
Yes.

437
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,440
What about Chen Ming?

438
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,960
I don't know.

439
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,960
They should all be here for the final.

440
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,560
Wait a minute.

441
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Look, is that

442
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,800
Sa?

443
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,440
Sa

444
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
Do you work as a bodyguard

445
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,680
or an emcee?

446
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,640
For an interview?

447
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,200
For a blind date?

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,040
For love?

449
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,880
There is the opening ceremony today.

450
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,040
We can't lose

451
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,440
in the imposing manner.

452
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,280
Don't touch me.

453
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,760
Let's go.

454
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,160
Didn't you stay away from us

455
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
because of something this morning?

456
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,120
Why is he so strange today?

457
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,760
He doesn't compete.

458
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,720
Why does he do that?

459
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,360
He's been strange since yesterday.

460
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,240
If something goes wrong, there must be something strange.

461
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,040
But

462
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
he is quite right about one thing.

463
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,800
We can't lose in the imposing manner.

464
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,920
Let's go.

465
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,000
Coming.

466
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,800
Wow.

467
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,840
This is Qiu Heng,

468
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,520
the best debater in the last competition.

469
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
His strength is unfathomable.

470
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,680
Together,

471
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,840
you can only tie him.

472
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,560
What's wrong with you?

473
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,680
How can you boost other people's morale

474
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,560
and reduce our own courage?

475
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,280
I can do it alone.

476
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,880
If I become a champion in the future,

477
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,960
I'll walk as cool as him.

478
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,400
This is Shang Da,

479
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,000
the third place last year.

480
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
She's better.

481
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,840
She had just been on a debate show.

482
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,160
She's gaining popularity.

483
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,800
Netizens jokingly claim

484
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
that her logic is clearer than the crosswalk.

485
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,160
That's just a quarrelsome

486
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,920
variety show.

487
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,800
It's just so-so.

488
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,400
Hao, right?

489
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,480
Can I ask him for an autograph?

490
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,400
Me too.

491
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,440
What's the matter with you guys?

492
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,400
We are professional debaters.

493
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,880
Can you

494
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
be professional?

495
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
It's just us two who are knowledgeable.

496
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,240
Right.

497
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,400
These three are so attractive.

498
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,480
Who are they?

499
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,880
You don't know them?

500
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,520
The thinnest one

501
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,640
is Jiang Yanchang,

502
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,480
the best debater

503
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,440
in the 1993 International Chinese Debate Competition.

504
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,720
He became famous

505
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,840
in that competition.

506
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,440
The one wearing glasses

507
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,040
is Yu Yi,

508
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,000
the best debater

509
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,120
in the 2001 International Chinese Debate Competition.

510
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,640
He is known as a role model for debaters.

511
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,560
The fattest one

512
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,080
is Lin Fanjiang,

513
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,880
the best debater

514
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,200
in the 1995 International Chinese Debate Competition.

515
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,760
Hello.

516
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,440
Hello.

517
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,920
I'll go, too.

518
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,920
I'll go, too.

519
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,160
Hello.

520
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,520
Hello.

521
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,560
Could you sign for me?

522
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,400
Thank you.

523
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,560
Just the two of us still have some concentration.

524
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,200
Really.

525
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Right.

526
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,800
Too...

527
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,080
Why do you wear sunglasses?

528
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,200
For sun protection.

529
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,040
He's so handsome.

530
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,160
There's no sun here.

531
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,200
The moon and six debaters.

532
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,080
This bar is quite literary.

533
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,440
Where's Sa?

534
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,040
I don't know.

535
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,560
He is very strange these days.

536
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,360
He may have gone to do good deeds.

537
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,000
By the way,

538
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
I remind you

539
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,800
that there are many school teams

540
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,680
in this competition,

541
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,640
so we can't talk

542
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,040
like we are at school.

543
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,040
We must behave ourselves.

544
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Right.

545
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,840
We should look like

546
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,880
the championship candidates.

547
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,280
Look, this is amazing.

548
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,720
Here.

549
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,800
Need, root, solution and gain/loss ratio.

550
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,880
It turns out that

551
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,280
this is a debate-oriented bar.

552
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,800
It's amazing.

553
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,080
Need, root,

554
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,480
solution and gain/loss ratio.

555
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,960
Everywhere is value.

556
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,080
Waiter

557
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,680
One cup for each, please.

558
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,560
Need, root, solution and gain/loss ratio.

559
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,760
Drinking in order

560
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,560
will taste better.

561
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,960
Shui, why are you here?

562
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
When you play the game,

563
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm paid three times the usual rate.

564
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,000
So

565
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,360
I come to earn money.

566
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,560
If your band

567
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,040
doesn't win the championship, they should be sorry for you.

568
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,560
All right, let me get your wine.

569
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,760
Let me make a special one

570
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,360
without alcohol for Xiaoyu.

571
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,480
Shui, why?

572
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,640
Please show me some respect.

573
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,360
Are you going to

574
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,040
play a game or

575
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,480
a group fight

576
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,360
when you drink too much?

577
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,880
I'm sorry.

578
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,920
Yo.

579
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,480
There you are.

580
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
I have packed all kinds of food

581
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
in the dining area

582
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,480
and put them in.

583
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,560
We're drawn for

584
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,320
the opening competition.

585
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
We're going to get ready in a minute.

586
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,720
You just arrived at the hotel

587
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,760
last night.

588
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,880
How's the preparation going?

589
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,640
Can you?

590
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
We prepared all night.

591
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,920
Enough.

592
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,120
This is a provincial competition.

593
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,920
Don't underestimate the enemy.

594
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
If you guys have this in mind,

595
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,240
you might as well worry more

596
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,160
about yourselves.

597
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm afraid that we

598
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,080
have a hard time making it to the finals,

599
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,000
but you guys are eliminated.

600
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,120
You can't be eliminated, right?

601
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,600
Of course not.

602
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,480
Attention, all teams.

603
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,160
The opening ceremony is about to begin.

604
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,800
Please move to the auditorium.

605
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,840
Let's go.

606
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,520
Liu Yanze

607
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,320
I'll cheer you up later.

608
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
Come on, Yin Nan.

609
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,560
You are an ingrate.

610
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,600
Let's go?

611
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,080
No.

612
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,920
The level of the first competition

613
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,800
is very low.

614
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,840
There is nothing worth seeing.

615
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,240
First of all,

616
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,400
on behalf of...

617
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,040
Sorry.

618
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,640
These seem to be our seats.

619
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,600
Sorry.

620
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,720
And

621
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,440
the support of all universities.

622
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,800
Let me express my heartfelt thanks.

623
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,640
Hello.

624
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,840
You're from Team 235, right?

625
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,280
You have your own seats.

626
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,240
But they're not here.

627
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,880
Please follow me.

628
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,760
Thank you.

629
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,680
We have privileges?

630
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,880
This organizer is good.

631
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,720
A total of 14 college debate teams

632
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,920
and two social debate teams

633
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,200
participate in the final.

634
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
I hope

635
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,200
you can

636
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,240
show your best

637
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,400
in the following competitions.

638
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,640
I will

639
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,480
double this revenge.

640
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,480
Demonstrate youthfulness.

641
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,640
Now let's have the two teams

642
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,360
of the opening competition.

643
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,120
The school team of DUFE

644
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,280
and the National University of Business and Economics.

645
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,160
Give it up

646
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,840
for them.

647
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,000
Come on, Liu Yanze.

648
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,480
Welcome to the first competition

649
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,200
of this year's league.

650
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,680
I am Wang Yi'ni,

651
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
the chairman of this competition.

652
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Today's resolution is

653
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,800
about anxiety marketing

654
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,360
for the middle-income group...

655
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,080
What are you doing?

656
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,240
Videoing the competition.

657
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,000
The positive side DUFE

658
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,760
thinks it is immoral.

659
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,680
They play the competition.

660
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,440
Why do you video them?

661
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,280
Xiaoyu, please mind your boyfriend.

662
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,240
Don't bully my friend.

663
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,240
Sa

664
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,520
What are you going to do?

665
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,160
Going to the bathroom.

666
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,680
This is the roster.

667
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,920
Which debate team are you from?

668
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
Team 235.

669
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,760
We've changed players before.

670
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,920
I'll see

671
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,880
if it's up to date.

672
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,520
The so-called anxiety marketing

673
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,600
is just a marketing method.

674
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,920
My fellow debaters, it's not appropriate

675
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,240
for you to judge by morality, right?

676
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,560
So is pyramid selling

677
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,800
a marketing method?

678
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,480
Can't we say

679
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
it is immoral?

680
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,760
Anxiety marketing

681
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,000
takes advantage of specific emotions

682
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,800
of specific people.

683
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,880
But what kind of marketing

684
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,160
doesn't take advantage of people's emotions?

685
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,200
Discounts and promotions

686
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
take advantage of people's

687
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,560
emotions of taking advantage.

688
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,080
The use of spokespersons takes advantage of

689
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,800
fans' idolatry.

690
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
Even some health care products for the elderly

691
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,080
take advantage of their children's filial piety

692
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,760
and their worries about their parents.

693
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,880
Different from this,

694
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,240
the article about anxiety marketing

695
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
is about

696
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,480
what kind of life

697
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
we should have

698
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,400
and what kind of partner and path

699
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,480
we should choose.

700
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,600
These are all important events

701
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,800
concerning our lives.

702
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,680
One wrong step will ruin our lives.

703
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
This is totally different from

704
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
discounts and promotions.

705
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,880
If a few words can affect life,

706
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,240
a country can be destroyed

707
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,800
if a nail is lost.

708
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,760
My fellow debaters,

709
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,680
you think people

710
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,560
are too stupid.

711
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,880
Don't we all recognize

712
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,040
the content farms

713
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,760
for fear mongering?

714
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,960
My fellow debaters,

715
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,760
if so,

716
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,960
why is anxiety marketing

717
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,120
so popular?

718
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,160
How is it?

719
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,760
No problem.

720
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,080
Team one is going to lose?

721
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
He means there's no problem

722
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,680
for team one to win.

723
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,600
Well.

724
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,560
They play steadily.

725
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,760
Basically,

726
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,240
the other side's arguments are all refuted by them.

727
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,560
That's good.

728
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,200
This proves that this provincial competition

729
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
is not as terrible

730
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
as we think.

731
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,720
My fellow debaters, how do you define morality?

732
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,000
For example,

733
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
cheating is immoral.

734
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,960
Not necessarily.

735
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,680
White lies

736
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
are moral,

737
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,480
don't you think?

738
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,080
I agree with you.

739
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,920
So do you think

740
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,440
anxiety marketing is well-intentioned?

741
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,160
No.

742
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,240
But we don't think anxiety marketing

743
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,120
is malicious.

744
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,720
So good or bad,

745
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,920
you admit that anxiety marketing

746
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,000
is a kind of deception, right?

747
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,160
Please don't play with words.

748
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,600
Please don't play with words.

749
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,040
It's just a marketing act.

750
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,120
It's neither deceptive nor malicious.

751
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,120
Anxiety marketing is full of

752
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,720
tactics

753
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,480
that use innuendo

754
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,320
and biased views

755
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,080
to induce anxiety in customers.

756
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,280
It knows it will have a bad influence,

757
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,240
but it still does so.

758
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,400
Isn't this malicious?

759
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,360
This cannot be judged.

760
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,800
And we don't think

761
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,360
it makes sense.

762
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,480
After all, even the law

763
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,680
doesn't make any provision for this.

764
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,560
You are wrong again.

765
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,280
The penalty for intentional injury

766
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,600
is different from that for unintentional injury.

767
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,760
Murder and manslaughter

768
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,840
are also completely different crimes.

769
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,160
It can be seen that

770
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,200
the law has explicit provisions on this.

771
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,560
My fellow debaters, I suggest you

772
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,080
can minor in

773
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,960
a major in law.

774
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,280
Thanks to the debaters of both sides

775
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
for bringing us

776
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,240
a wonderful

777
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,280
free debate.

778
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,840
Next is

779
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,560
the final summary of this competition.

780
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,360
Please.

781
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Hello, everyone.

782
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,120
We are here today

783
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,080
to discuss whether anxiety marketing

784
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,520
is a moral issue.

785
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,720
What is morality?

786
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
Why should we abide by morality?

787
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,000
Sociologically speaking,

788
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,320
morality is our contract

789
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,800
to protect collective interests.

790
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,040
Psychologically speaking,

791
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,080
morality is a good way for us

792
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
to gain recognition.

793
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,520
Ethics tells us

794
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,080
that morality is the value and goal

795
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,920
we pursue personally.

796
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,400
It has too many definitions.

797
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,280
But if

798
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,880
we define it in a simple and straightforward way,

799
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I think

800
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
it's morality that lets us know

801
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,000
right and wrong.

802
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,640
Some people may ask

803
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,680
why anxiety marketing

804
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
for middle-income people

805
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,560
is wrong.

806
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,440
Is it wrong

807
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,120
to remind them how dangerous

808
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,960
the world is?

809
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
It tells them that if they don't work hard,

810
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,200
their children may

811
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,800
not be as good as themselves.

812
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,040
What's wrong with this?

813
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,040
Others have houses, cars

814
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,720
and no loans.

815
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,440
This should be

816
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,800
your pursuit and goal.

817
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,120
There is nothing wrong with this.

818
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,800
In fact, the mistake is

819
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,200
that you tell the truth,

820
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,960
but you only tell

821
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,440
a small part of the truth.

822
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,440
You tell people

823
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,680
that danger is everywhere.

824
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,400
But you don't speak

825
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,000
kindness is even more everywhere.

826
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,240
You stimulate others' desires.

827
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,120
But you don't say

828
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,880
that actually these desires don't matter at all.

829
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,840
If there is someone

830
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
who keeps telling you

831
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,000
how dangerous the world is

832
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,320
until you get upset

833
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,480
and finally die by suicide,

834
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,880
then it is wrong.

835
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,400
Sorry.

836
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,840
It's wrong

837
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,000
to fill other people's lives

838
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,200
with false

839
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,600
bubble-like anxiety

840
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,400
and to deprive them of time, energy, traffic

841
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,000
and money

842
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
in ways that hurt them.

843
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880
Thank you.

844
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,560
He's good.

845
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
You're jealous.

846
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,640
You can also win such a simple competition.

847
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,680
Not necessarily.

848
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,680
They are better at defending,

849
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,560
so they are restrained.

850
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,880
We are also good at

851
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,640
defending.

852
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,080
So we always lose.

853
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,960
Congratulations to Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics

854
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,560
for winning this competition.

855
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,520
You were really great just now.

856
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,400
Where were you sitting just now?

857
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Why didn't I see you?

858
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,080
Umm.

859
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
The newly added seats in the last row.

860
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,560
It's okay.

861
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,880
If you sit too close to the front,

862
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,200
you will affect me.

863
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,720
You have a competition today too, right?

864
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,560
Yes.

865
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,760
The third division.

866
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,840
The time is almost up.

867
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,760
It's time for us

868
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,280
to get ready.

869
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,000
We'll be there later

870
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,920
to watch you play, too.

871
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,840
Okay. See you later.

872
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,240
Okay.

873
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,400
Bye.

874
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,880
Come on, video from the coach.

875
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,160
Hello.

876
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,600
Hello.

877
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
Hello.

878
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,640
When will you

879
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,080
come to see us?

880
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,200
Right.

881
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,840
Why don't you come for a few days?

882
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,400
Why does he cough so badly?

883
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,200
He's not really sick, right?

884
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,800
Of course, he is really ill.

885
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,320
Otherwise, why does he

886
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,160
stay in hospital for such a long time?

887
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
Don't worry.

888
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,640
Please take care of yourself.

889
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,560
We can hold out

890
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,520
until you come.

891
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,120
Coach

892
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,480
Let Sa

893
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,320
pick you up then.

894
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,720
You haven't been

895
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,480
in his car yet.

896
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,960
He drives like a roller coaster.

897
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,720
You can experience it once.

898
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,600
Let me say a few words briefly.

899
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Don't be nervous.

900
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,720
Just like usual.

901
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Although I have not

902
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,120
personally guided you

903
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
recently,

904
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,160
your progress

905
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,040
is obvious to all.

906
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,840
That's okay.

907
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
Do a good job.

908
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,960
Try your best.

909
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,720
We got it.

910
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,800
We'll do our best.

911
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,400
Don't worry.

912
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,400
We'll work on it.

913
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,560
Goodbye.

914
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,280
Goodbye.

915
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,680
I feel like he's

916
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,000
in particularly poor health today.

917
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,920
He

918
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,720
is

919
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,920
really nervous.

920
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,400
Everyone.

921
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,720
We've had a tough journey.

922
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,200
Thank you all for not giving up.

923
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,840
Let's do our best.

924
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,560
Let's bring the trophy

925
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,200
back to the old coach.

926
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,760
Only we know

927
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
how much hardship we have experienced along the way.

928
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,480
Come on.

929
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,400
Let's give ourselves a boost.

930
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,960
Hello, everyone.

931
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,560
Today, our view is

932
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,440
that knowledge economy

933
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
is widening the gap between countries.

934
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,440
Knowledge economy

935
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,280
is not a strict economic concept.

936
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,080
It is mainly used to define

937
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,440
economic activities based on the production,

938
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,200
distribution and use of knowledge.

939
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,560
We all know

940
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
that human knowledge has developed

941
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,760
to a leading position

942
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,840
on a large scale

943
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,080
and systematization,

944
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
both in terms of science and technology

945
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,800
and humanities.

946
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
The ancient people just studied hard for ten years

947
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,000
before they could join the imperial examination.

948
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,000
But today we are

949
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,080
still in our first year of high school

950
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,960
after ten years of study.

951
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,880
We can't even complete

952
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,680
a basic education.

953
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,680
So the progress of knowledge

954
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
is increasingly dependent on

955
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,680
scale, teams, resources

956
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,800
and even the input and support of national strength.

957
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,240
Scale is

958
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,360
the biggest obstacle to future knowledge.

959
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,440
And it will

960
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,120
certainly promote the trend of monopoly

961
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
from the source

962
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,520
of the knowledge economy.

963
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,800
This may not be

964
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,520
what we expected.

965
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,320
The knowledge economy has no way

966
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,920
to bring us

967
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,560
more equal opportunities.

968
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,200
And it

969
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,400
will certainly widen

970
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,560
the gap among countries.

971
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,320
Thank you.

972
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,760
Will knowledge itself

973
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,960
be more widely disseminated

974
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,400
in the development of the knowledge economy?

975
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,760
The first debater

976
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,280
Yes.

977
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,800
But not all knowledge

978
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,880
has only economic value.

979
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,880
What kind of knowledge

980
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,080
has no economic value at all?

981
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,480
The fourth debater

982
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,160
Many.

983
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,000
Value does not mean

984
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,600
economic value.

985
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,520
If benefits are less than inputs,

986
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,240
it can be said that there is

987
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,800
little economic value,

988
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,760
such as the commercialization debate.

989
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,480
Don't avoid it.

990
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,600
The fourth debater, please answer me whether the knowledge

991
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,880
has been more widely disseminated.

992
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,040
On the whole, yes.

993
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,080
The third debater, does it make it easier

994
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,400
for countries with traditional educational advantages,

995
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,080
such as Japan,

996
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,560
to be caught up

997
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,400
by late-developing countries like China

998
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,880
and narrow the gap?

999
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,800
According to you,

1000
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,080
the improvement of public knowledge level

1001
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
has brought great advantages

1002
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,200
to countries with large populations,

1003
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,800
while countries with small populations

1004
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,480
are difficult to catch up with.

1005
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,840
Doesn't this widen the gap?

1006
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Yes, but now it is not to

1007
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,000
widen the gap

1008
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,880
but to narrow it.

1009
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,120
After all, developing countries

1010
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,840
like China and India

1011
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,000
are populous.

1012
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,200
The United States is also a populous country.

1013
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,000
According to you,

1014
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,160
it is difficult for the United States to catch up?

1015
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
The fourth debater, your argument notes

1016
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,600
that the development of knowledge economy

1017
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,680
can help late-developing countries

1018
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,480
surpass other countries quickly,

1019
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,200
right?

1020
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,000
Of course.

1021
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
African Uganda's

1022
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,480
booming film industry

1023
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,120
and India's world-leading

1024
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,800
IT industry

1025
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,760
are good examples.

1026
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,640
As far as I know,

1027
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
the development of IT industry in India

1028
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,280
has led to the weak industrial base,

1029
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,560
insufficient comprehensiveness

1030
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,160
and sluggish momentum of economic development in India.

1031
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,520
The first debater, how can this be explained?

1032
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,880
What I see is that India's economy

1033
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,680
is booming.

1034
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,080
Besides, even as you said,

1035
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,640
at least the gap

1036
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,280
in IT industry

1037
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,680
has been indeed narrowed.

1038
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,480
A poor student

1039
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,640
narrows the score gap

1040
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,520
between him and a good student

1041
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,640
by memorizing English model essays.

1042
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,480
But all his time and energy are

1043
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,800
spent reciting model essays.

1044
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
So he misses more classes.

1045
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,920
Excuse me, is this gap narrowing

1046
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,240
a real narrowing, the third debater?

1047
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,600
Of course.

1048
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,000
That's the problem.

1049
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,320
Because the score of composition

1050
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,120
is limited.

1051
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,080
A brief narrowing is followed by

1052
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,520
a rapid widening of the gap.

1053
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,240
Because once the time and opportunity of poor students are lost,

1054
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,440
they will not come back.

1055
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
And the national competition,

1056
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,680
just like the exam,

1057
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
won't wait for you to start over.

1058
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,960
Does the development of knowledge economy

1059
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,640
promote

1060
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,760
the progress of copyright industry?

1061
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,200
The progress of copyright industry

1062
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,320
protects knowledge producers,

1063
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,200
which is equivalent to protecting

1064
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,800
the development opportunities of late-developing countries.

1065
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,880
Late-developing countries are poor.

1066
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
The perfection of copyright industry

1067
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,960
makes them

1068
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,560
have no chance to

1069
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,040
buy knowledge.

1070
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,160
So the gap has been widened.

1071
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,280
The core of knowledge economy lies in talent.

1072
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,280
Talent has a better chance to

1073
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
discourage late-developing countries

1074
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,080
than hard power

1075
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,120
such as rockets and aircraft carriers.

1076
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,680
Qian Xuesen

1077
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,640
broke through

1078
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,360
the obstruction of the United States

1079
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,240
to return to serve China.

1080
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,280
Is it too easy

1081
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,000
for you to sum up

1082
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,200
with the word "easy"?

1083
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,920
My fellow debaters, do you agree

1084
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,720
that knowledge economy promotes

1085
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,560
globalization

1086
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,800
and breaks more barriers?

1087
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,040
Nearly 90%

1088
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,800
of the knowledge and information

1089
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,720
on the Internet

1090
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,000
are in English.

1091
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,760
Unfortunately,

1092
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,720
most people who use English

1093
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,520
come from developed countries.

1094
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
Does this break down the barrier

1095
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,600
or build it up?

1096
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Different reactions to one thing

1097
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,200
will lead to completely different results.

1098
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,000
Today, we advocate narrowing the gap

1099
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,680
is to make more Chinese people

1100
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,560
realize that

1101
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,400
seizing opportunities and strengthening the country with knowledge.

1102
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
Different reactions to one thing

1103
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,400
will lead to completely different results.

1104
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,120
This is based on

1105
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,680
having a correct understanding of events.

1106
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
My fellow debaters, you misinterpret the debate

1107
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,640
from a factual one

1108
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,160
to a value one.

1109
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,800
However, the discussion

1110
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,680
is what it is,

1111
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,800
not what it does.

1112
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,880
We believe

1113
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
that it is precisely because the knowledge economy

1114
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,800
will widen the gap among countries

1115
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
that we realize the crisis and urgency.

1116
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,480
This is the real way to strengthen the country.

1117
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,000
Thank you.

1118
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,800
The result is now in.

1119
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,160
The winner of this competition is

1120
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,760
Team 235.

1121
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,120
Let's congratulate them.

1122
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,000
You're great.

1123
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,920
You're great.

1124
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,080
I know.

1125
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,800
Honestly,

1126
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,120
I'm still nervous.

1127
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,200
My palms are sweaty.

1128
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,320
Let's have a slap-up meal.

1129
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:25,680
OK.

1130
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,600
Let's go, let me treat you.

1131
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,680
The small restaurant nearby.

1132
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,600
OK, let's go to the small restaurant today.

1133
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,720
Let's go to the grand hotel in the future.

1134
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,400
What a shame to go to the small restaurant.

1135
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,400
You scared me.

1136
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,080
Why are you here?

1137
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,240
You especially wanna

1138
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
go to the hotel buffet.

1139
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,280
So I've got a voucher

1140
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,200
for each of you.

1141
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,400
Thank you, Shui.

1142
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,400
Thank you.

1143
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,560
It is useless and insufficient

1144
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,440
to thank more.

1145
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,720
What are you waiting for?

1146
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,880
Go for it.

1147
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Thank you, Shui.

1148
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,160
You're great.

1149
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,240
Dear all.

1150
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,480
Enjoy yourself.

1151
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,800
There are also many delicious foods here.

1152
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,200
Food in the five-star hotel

1153
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,240
is delicious.

1154
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,320
Shui, you are not afraid of being fired

1155
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
for treating us like this?

1156
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,000
Right.

1157
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,520
It costs 399 yuan for one person.

1158
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,280
The ancients said that swords should be given to heroes

1159
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,280
and delicacies should be given to fellow debaters.

1160
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,680
Look, Ma Nan.

1161
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,280
There is another person

1162
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,800
who can make up famous sayings better than you.

1163
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
I don't think so.

1164
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,440
He's not as cool as me.

1165
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,000
Well, dear all.

1166
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,840
No bullshit with you.

1167
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,600
I gotta run.

1168
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
If you have anything, call me.

1169
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,960
Thank you, Shui. Bye.

1170
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
You can't drink coke like that.

1171
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,200
Why?

1172
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,920
This is the biggest taboo of eating buffet.

1173
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,720
Do you know

1174
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,320
what its essence is?

1175
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,480
You walk around

1176
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,240
and eat all your

1177
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,040
favorite foods.

1178
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
This is a carbonated drink.

1179
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,960
Carbonated drinks can cause satiety.

1180
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,920
Satiety is the biggest taboo.

1181
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Look.

1182
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,560
Take the first sip of coke, three yuan.

1183
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,000
Take the second sip of coke, two yuan.

1184
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,800
Take the third sip of coke, three yuan,

1185
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
worthless just like this bottle.

1186
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,320
One yuan.

1187
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,960
Your major is economics.

1188
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,680
You don't understand this.

1189
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,560
It's none of your business.

1190
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,120
What I drink is not coke

1191
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,920
but happiness.

1192
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,600
Happiness.

1193
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,560
Well.

1194
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,120
All right.

1195
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,800
Let's eat.

1196
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,000
We have to prepare for the competition.

1197
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
We have to compete every day

1198
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,440
before we're successfully qualified to the semi-finals.

1199
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,360
Cheers.

1200
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,160
You're a drama queen.

1201
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,280
You're good.

1202
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,320
It's water.

1203
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,360
The first challenge we face is

1204
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,480
heavy competition tasks

1205
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,280
and little preparation time.

1206
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,360
So we prepare according to

1207
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,560
our most familiar division of labor.

1208
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,160
Nan Bei and Xiaoyu are responsible for attack and defense.

1209
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Ma Nan is responsible for the closing argument.

1210
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,360
There are many competitions.

1211
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,600
So let me and Dango review the manuscript.

1212
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
We take turns as the first debater.

1213
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,680
Come on.

1214
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,840
Let's begin.

1215
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,600
This is

1216
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,760
the common view

1217
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,680
of our previous generation.

1218
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,800
They think that if you don't suffer,

1219
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,200
you don't grow up.

1220
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,360
Young people are not trustworthy.

1221
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,760
This is too outdated.

1222
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,760
The generation after 2000s

1223
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,320
who grow up happily in peace time

1224
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,400
have already held up half the world.

1225
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,800
As far as our generation is concerned,

1226
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,160
we have experienced extremely difficult NCEE

1227
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,120
and faced the huge pressure of buying a house and employment.

1228
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Moreover, it is not easy for people

1229
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,720
who go to work in big cities,

1230
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,800
so they can't be regarded as having never suffered.

1231
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,080
So will they say

1232
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,960
that every generation

1233
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,880
has its own suffering?

1234
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,240
It doesn't make sense. Remember

1235
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,280
that the debate is aimed at discussing suffering itself,

1236
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,360
and it does not require suffering to exist.

1237
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,760
Can suffering

1238
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,040
cultivate people

1239
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,960
to a certain extent?

1240
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,440
Right.

1241
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,280
It cultivates us

1242
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,960
and makes us grow.

1243
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,080
Isn't it worth thanking?

1244
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,920
The enemy who killed my father

1245
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,560
can also develop

1246
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,040
my strong character.

1247
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,040
Do I have to say

1248
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,720
thank you to him?

1249
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,880
You should thank him for developing

1250
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,920
your strong character.

1251
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,280
You should also hate him for killing your father.

1252
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,640
You should look at a matter dialectically.

1253
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,600
According to you,

1254
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,520
I can thank everything

1255
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,360
in this world.

1256
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,800
Thanks to the earthquake

1257
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,880
for giving real estate developers opportunities.

1258
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,480
Thanks to the fire for giving succors

1259
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,480
a chance to show their bravery.

1260
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,080
Thanks to the war

1261
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,320
for making heroes and legends.

1262
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Thanks to those spoiled brats

1263
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,320
who broke my mobile phone

1264
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,040
for giving me a chance

1265
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,160
to change my mobile phone.

1266
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,120
Can you name

1267
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,640
one thing

1268
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,520
I can't thank?

1269
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,000
My fellow debaters

1270
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,880
This is not dialectical, but bitchy.

1271
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,360
Thank you.

1272
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
The winner this time is

1273
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,040
Team 235.

1274
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,400
Let's congratulate them.
