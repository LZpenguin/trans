Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP04

2
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,320
You silly twerp, take it easy.

3
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
Next, welcome

4
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,640
any two debaters

5
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,200
to have a one-to-one debate.

6
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,880
Welcome.

7
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,720
Hello, my fellow debater.

8
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,360
Hello.

9
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,280
Can I ask you

10
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,240
if heteronomy is ubiquitous?

11
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
Is there a vacuum in heteronomy?

12
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:34,960
Definitely.

13
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,320
So,

14
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
self-discipline plays a role in

15
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,240
the vacuum of heteronomy.

16
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Does that demonstrate that

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,920
self-discipline is only a supplement to heteronomy?

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,880
He's switching the relation of elements with keywords.

19
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,040
Is supplement not important?

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,960
One reverses an overwhelming adverse situation

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,760
like saving a gigantic building from its collapse at the last critical moment.

22
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,680
Is it a supplement?

23
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,400
Why is

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
self-discipline, which is an important supplement

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,120
not

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,160
more important than heteronomy which is not needed.

27
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,600
Because the supplement is not the subject.

28
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,520
What we advocate is that

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,600
in a society with a good system,

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,200
heteronomy can

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,240
guide all your actions.

32
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,560
Everyone and everything

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
are guided by heteronomy.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,160
Without exception.

35
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,080
But my fellow debtor

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,040
advocated to prioritize the self-discipline.

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Do you want us to go back to

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,840
the chaotic and disordered

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,760
dark forest?

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
The chaos and disorder of the dark forest

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,120
is precisely

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
the consequence of

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
the lack of self-discipline.

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm afraid this stems from

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,680
the fact that we both

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,600
have different judgments about human nature.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,640
Can I ask my fellow debater another question?

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
As the saying goes, it's difficult to follow the path of virtue

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,720
but easy to succumb to vice.

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,600
Is self-discipline

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,760
more difficult to adhere to than heteronomy?

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
Doesn't difficulty mean

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,480
it's important?

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,200
For example, I

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
got 130 points in the Chinese exam

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,960
while only 60 points in math.

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,640
For me, is it

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,200
more important

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,800
to learn math well?

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
Is the shortcoming itself more important?

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
Or is it more important to make up for the shortcoming?

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
For my fellow debater,

63
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,720
what really matters

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
should be how to

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,040
improve the math performance

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,280
rather than the math itself.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Next, welcome

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,240
any two debaters

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,560
to make a summary

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
of the above-mentioned questioning session.

71
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,400
The time is three minutes.

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,280
First, let's welcome the positive side.

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,960
Dango

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
Do you know that?

75
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,840
When everyone performed

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,520
seamlessly

77
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,640
and meticulously,

78
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,200
my suggestion is to improvise.

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
In this way,

80
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
your plain language,

81
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,480
occasional stammering,

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,200
and incoherent words because of excitement,

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
will instead...

84
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,040
They will all be weapons.

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,680
Thank you, chief judge.

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,280
Hello, everyone.

87
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,760
my fellow debater

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,800
thinks the criterion for judging importance

89
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,880
is whether it is conducive to growth.

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,200
But what is growth?

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,880
Under heteronomy,

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,480
studying hard to get into a prestigious school

93
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
is indeed a kind of growth.

94
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Under heteronomy,

95
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
even your major

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,000
has to be decided by others.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,320
Is it a kind of growth?

98
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
When we want to be free,

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,640
but cannot control ourselves,

100
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,280
Time and time again, we have to pay

101
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
a painful price.

102
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,680
Is it

103
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
a kind of growth?

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
So, what is the growth?

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,120
Can't we

106
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,880
decide

107
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,120
how we grow up?

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,400
When I first entered college,

109
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,400
I spent all night with my friends,

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
having beer and skittles together.

111
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,160
For the first time ever, I tasted

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
the joy of mastering my own affairs.

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
I would like to

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,440
take back

115
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,320
all the freedom

116
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,720
that was suppressed for more than ten years.

117
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
I will buy beautiful skirts.

118
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,680
They are cheap when they are on sale on the shopping festival.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,720
I will eat all

120
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
the delicious food around.

121
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,520
A few dozen dollars a meal

122
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,600
is a good deal.

123
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
I have worked hard for more than a decade.

124
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
I want to dawdle in bed and skip a class.

125
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
It's no big deal.

126
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,040
It doesn't cost much each time.

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm really not a person who likes wasting.

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
The single-plank bridge of the college entrance examination

129
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,920
has been crossed by me.

130
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Skipping one or two classes

131
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
will have no influence on my excellence.

132
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,480
How can I possibly

133
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,680
not manage my own

134
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,520
life?

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
But one day,

136
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,720
The balance on the card becomes negative.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,160
The public list of retakes

138
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,360
contains my name.

139
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,040
How could that happen?

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
Where is my money?

141
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,000
Where is my time?

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
What shall I do?

143
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,320
I was afraid.

144
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,480
I was afraid to mention it to my parents.

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,560
I was afraid to lose

146
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,640
the freedom that I just obtained.

147
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,920
I was afraid of becoming

148
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,600
the person who lives

149
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
in the shadow of others again.

150
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
I started to borrow money from everywhere.

151
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,240
I started to use online loans.

152
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,760
I started to hire someone to deal with the attendance.

153
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,680
I even started to

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,720
buy assignments online.

155
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,480
But,

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,560
When the phone rings of demanding payments of the debts,

157
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,120
when my friends became

158
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
my debtors,

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,240
when the

160
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,960
merit student

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,080
now was at the bottom of the class,

162
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,920
I have found that

163
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,120
without knowing it,

164
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,520
I had already indulged

165
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,400
and lost my bottom line.

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,200
How I wish

167
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,240
there was a heteronomy

168
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,600
put forward by my fellow debaters

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
to discipline me,

170
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
and to warn me.

171
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,800
But after thinking over it,

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,360
heteronomy has never left me.

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,880
It is

174
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
a nag in our ears,

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
a cliché, and groundless worries or anxieties.

176
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
It is like

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
I know that.

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,320
Knock it off. Don't you feel fidget?

179
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,560
Think about that.

180
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
We can always

181
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,400
leave the heteronomy we don't like

182
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,520
isolated from

183
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,320
our own lives.

184
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,640
Heteronomy can

185
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,280
never dominate our lives.

186
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Only we

187
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,920
are the masters of our own lives.

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,280
Should we

189
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,240
seek the help and shelter

190
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,160
of heteronomy

191
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
like my fellow debaters,

192
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
or should we

193
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,080
behave like a master?

194
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,560
You have the right to choose.

195
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,560
Thank you.

196
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,040
Well done, Dango.

197
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,440
The summary is done.

198
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,960
Next,

199
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
the winner and loser

200
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
will be decided in the free debate.

201
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,440
Next,

202
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
it's the free debate.

203
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,240
First,

204
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
any debater of the positive side will stand up,

205
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,560
and sit down after the speech.

206
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,640
Then, any debater of the opposing side

207
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,280
will stand up to give us a speech.

208
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
The two sides alternate.

209
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,720
When the time of one side runs out,

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,520
the other side can continue to speak.

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Four minutes each.

212
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,560
Welcome.

213
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Since heteronomy

214
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
ultimately works only

215
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,320
through self-discipline,

216
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,120
why is

217
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,080
heteronomy more important?

218
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,640
Doesn't any restraint

219
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,520
work through us?

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,440
Slaves were

221
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,000
driven to labor by whips.

222
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,600
But the feet

223
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
are themselves.

224
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,480
According to what you said,

225
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,000
can this be called self-discipline?

226
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,560
The Qing Dynasty has fallen

227
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,160
for more than a century.

228
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,280
Can you stop living

229
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,880
in the slave society of

230
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,040
more than 2,000 years ago?

231
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,880
Today we

232
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,480
all need to

233
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,040
be responsible for ourselves,

234
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,280
and have the ability to discipline ourselves,

235
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,960
don't we?

236
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,880
Heteronomy is irresponsible?

237
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,520
My fellow debater claimed that if you abandon self-discipline,

238
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
the world will abandon you.

239
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:53,560
Is that true?

240
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,520
Is that true?

241
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,080
Then my fellow debater

242
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,840
might as well go to prison

243
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,520
and ask

244
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,720
the lawbreakers who have abandoned self-discipline.

245
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,480
Did the law

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,800
abandon him or not?

247
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,480
Your side have admitted that

248
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,400
there is a vacuum

249
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,080
where heteronomy cannot manage.

250
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Parents will grow old.

251
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
Families will get separated.

252
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
When you are in college,

253
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,040
you do not develop

254
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,560
self-discipline.

255
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,840
When will you develop it?

256
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,960
A small tree is not a seedling unless it is trimmed.

257
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Nothing can be accomplished without norms or standards.

258
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,280
Heteronomy can

259
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
be used to develop self-discipline.

260
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,520
I would like to ask my fellow debaters.

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,960
Is the law more

262
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,880
effective than self-discipline?

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
I think when you are in college,

264
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,880
if you don't develop

265
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,840
the self-discipline,

266
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,640
you may really

267
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,080
need the law

268
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
to control you in the future.

269
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,200
Zengzi said that

270
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,240
I do self-inspection on three aspects every day.

271
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,120
Confucius also said that

272
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
if you cannot restrain yourself,

273
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,040
how to restrain others?

274
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
Confucianism emphasizes being strict with yourself.

275
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,400
Does that demonstrate that

276
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
self-discipline is more important?

277
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,360
The word "inspection" in the sentence "do self-inspection on three aspects"

278
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,240
means reflection.

279
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,040
Reflection and self-discipline

280
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,080
are not the same things.

281
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Confucius emphasized the Chou Rituals throughout his life.

282
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,800
Doesn't this emphasize

283
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,480
the importance of the ceremonial system

284
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,840
as heteronomy?

285
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,680
Wrong.

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,920
What Confucius emphasizes is

287
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,440
to restrain ourselves and restore the rites.

288
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,360
Do not speak what is contrary to propriety.

289
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,800
Do not look at what is contrary to propriety.

290
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Do not listen to what is contrary to propriety.

291
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,880
Is this kind of self-restraint

292
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
a kind of self-discipline?

293
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,960
Chinese people advocate self-supervision.

294
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,640
Is it a kind of self-discipline?

295
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,720
Self-supervision is not that easy.

296
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,480
Otherwise, how can there be so many

297
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,520
idle villains?

298
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,200
Does this prove that

299
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,640
self-discipline is difficult

300
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,440
and inefficient?

301
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,360
Leave the efficiency alone.

302
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,440
In the adulthood,

303
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,040
is self-discipline

304
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,960
more commonly used?

305
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,720
Not exactly.

306
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,560
We can say that self-discipline

307
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,160
accounts for a larger proportion.

308
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,640
Fine.

309
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
We admit that.

310
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,560
Isn't the one with a larger proportion

311
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,400
more important?

312
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,200
The ass in the human body

313
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,320
is heavier

314
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,280
than the head.

315
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,960
Does that mean that

316
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
the ass is more important than the head?

317
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,400
It seems that the better one can be clearly found out.

318
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,600
But unknowingly,

319
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,360
they have admitted

320
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
many small arguments of the other side.

321
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,880
So, you think

322
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
children more need self-discipline,

323
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,400
while adults more need heteronomy, right?

324
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,800
So what?

325
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,800
Why do we

326
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,320
hope the adults

327
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
more self-disciplined,

328
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,800
while have few demands

329
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,840
for the children?

330
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,920
According to your logic,

331
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,680
we should ask

332
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,760
children to be more self-controlled,

333
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,440
and adults should

334
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,840
be arranged

335
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,600
like children

336
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,080
in the

337
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
kindergarten.

338
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,600
Isn't it?

339
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,880
Because if the

340
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,560
adults with a strong action

341
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,240
lack self-control

342
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,400
can cause more harm.

343
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,080
So, we

344
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,120
can't just chant the slogan.

345
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,160
We should utilize heteronomy

346
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,880
to practically help them

347
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,320
to solve the problems.

348
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
Is that wrong?

349
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
They are too good at

350
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
using disguised replacement of concept

351
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,720
to make the logic confused.

352
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,560
We are always in

353
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,400
the rhythm of the other side.

354
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Even if they react fast,

355
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
they still can't counter-attack in time.

356
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,520
I am the master of my youth.

357
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,360
Why should I

358
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,600
deliver my freedom to others?

359
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,080
Freedom?

360
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
How many sins are made in this name?

361
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,600
Not to mention that heteronomy is just a restraint

362
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
other than a master.

363
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
Who can live without some constraints?

364
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,360
The emperor has to

365
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,240
get up early to deal with the national affairs.

366
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,280
He cannot lie in.

367
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,440
The emperors are different.

368
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,320
Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty can certainly

369
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
make his own decisions.

370
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
But Liu Xie, Emperor Xian of the Han dynasty

371
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,120
is different.

372
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
He's digressing from the point.

373
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,400
He is confused again.

374
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,520
The example of my fellow debater

375
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
is interesting.

376
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,320
Self-disciplined Emperor Wu

377
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,000
finally

378
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,880
was militaristic.

379
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
His country was almost ruined.

380
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,320
It can be concluded that without heteronomy,

381
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,720
the consequence is serious.

382
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,480
You are wrong.

383
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,320
Emperor Wu's mistakes in his later years

384
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,080
were precisely the result of

385
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,760
the lack of self-discipline.

386
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,600
But he reflected on himself.

387
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,720
He issued the edict on the crime of Luntai,

388
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
and no longer honored military but to advocate peace.

389
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,760
Because of self-discipline, he made his country

390
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,120
prosperous again.

391
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,240
This is the role of self-discipline.

392
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,760
But Emperor Wu regretted too late.

393
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,240
Tens of thousands of people died in the Witchcraft Rebellion.

394
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
The treasury is empty,

395
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,000
and people are rioting and unsettled.

396
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
On the contrary, Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty

397
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,040
had the admonisher, Wei Zheng.

398
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,320
Taking the human as the mirror can understand the gains and losses.

399
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,160
Heteronomy

400
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,920
brought him

401
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,200
the Excellent Governance during the Zhenguan Times.

402
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,440
It seems that

403
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,600
the opposing side is not correct.

404
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,600
But it feels that

405
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,800
what they said makes sense.

406
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,880
Me too.

407
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,960
I think

408
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,720
the positive side is true.

409
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Our arguments

410
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,720
were fixed limitedly.

411
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,200
It can be concluded that

412
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680
the gap is narrowing.

413
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,600
If we want to win...

414
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,640
Now, it's the last session

415
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,720
of the contest,

416
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,120
the concluding speech session.

417
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,080
So, let's welcome

418
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,480
any debaters of the opposing side

419
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,880
to make a concluding speech.

420
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,080
The time is three minutes.

421
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,760
Welcome.

422
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,920
Hello, everyone.

423
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,280
The opinions of my fellow debaters

424
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
are too simple.

425
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,720
They think that it's difficult to be self-disciplined.

426
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,760
To be self-disciplined

427
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
needs more efforts,

428
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,040
more time,

429
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,000
and more energy.

430
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,040
So, they told us

431
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,440
to pay attention to self-discipline.

432
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,600
Self-discipline is more important.

433
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
We don't consider that they

434
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,320
take the difficulty

435
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
as importance.

436
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
There is a

437
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
large logic problem.

438
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,400
Let's go back to the point.

439
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,480
Have you

440
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440
thought about

441
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
self-discipline is really that difficult?

442
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,000
Our leader told me that

443
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,480
She was naughty when she was young.

444
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,440
She didn't often wash her hands

445
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,360
before eating.

446
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,600
Fortunately, the baby-sitter restrained her strictly.

447
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:41,680
Under the threat of the baby-sitter,

448
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
Under the threat of the baby-sitter,

449
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,440
she developed a healthy and good habit.

450
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,960
So, if you lack self-discipline,

451
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,240
letting parents and teachers

452
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,040
restrain us more.

453
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,120
Gradually,

454
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,280
and naturally,

455
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,920
the good habit will be formed.

456
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,640
Self-discipline

457
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,920
will be developed as well.

458
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Let me think about one question.

459
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,200
From childhood to adulthood,

460
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
which ability of us

461
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,760
is not

462
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,640
developed like this?

463
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,120
We need to brush teeth after getting up.

464
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,080
We need to take a bath at night.

465
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
Don't gobble up your food.

466
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,320
We need to study step by step.

467
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,640
The word is learned one by one.

468
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,080
The problem is calculated one by one.

469
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,400
At first, which of these

470
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,920
is not forced to do

471
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,000
by parents and teachers?

472
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,320
But now,

473
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,600
which one does not

474
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,680
become the self-discipline of us?

475
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,600
After entering the college,

476
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,640
we have become

477
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,160
adults in the legal sense.

478
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,200
The difference of us

479
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,240
is that

480
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,040
we think that

481
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,400
we have not been prepared yet.

482
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,120
We still need

483
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,400
to have the help of the heteronomy

484
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,720
to avoid making mistakes,

485
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,600
and strive to

486
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,040
become a better person.

487
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,680
While my fellow debaters

488
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,360
is obviously not that sober.

489
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,720
They think that

490
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,120
we have grown up.

491
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,080
I don't want to be in charge.

492
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
I can be in charge of myself.

493
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,920
Stop dreaming.

494
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,280
Two months ago,

495
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,320
you were doing exercises at Mao Tanchang School.

496
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
What makes

497
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,800
you think

498
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,720
you can manage yourself after two months?

499
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There are many students with high scores

500
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,600
who

501
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,320
do not receive a diploma

502
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
after four years.

503
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,280
There are high-caliber students from Tsinghua University and Peking University

504
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,720
who

505
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,760
are discouraged every year

506
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,640
because of their lack of self-control.

507
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,320
Why can't we

508
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,560
recognize ourselves?

509
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,280
Why can't we

510
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,240
put down the proud

511
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,640
and greed of indulgence

512
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,240
to admit that

513
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,880
we still don't have

514
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,560
enough ability

515
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,520
to be in charge of ourselves,

516
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,920
and to admit that we still need

517
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,400
the restraint and help of heteronomy?

518
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,280
We can then use the restraint

519
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
and the help

520
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,440
to embrace the heteronomy

521
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
instead of excluding it, can't we?

522
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,760
Maybe ten years later,

523
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,200
when we recollecting today,

524
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
it will also be like looking back on

525
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,000
our high school days today.

526
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,720
We will find that the nagging parents,

527
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,800
strict teachers,

528
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
harsh school regulations,

529
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,480
and Mr. Zhang at the gate

530
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,920
who was catching the late students

531
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,640
were really helping you.

532
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
Thank you.

533
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,240
Clearly organized. Explicit values.

534
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,520
He's so great.

535
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,320
He's excellent.

536
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
How wonderful!

537
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,240
Just now the high level of

538
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,880
this closing argument

539
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,560
cannot be pulled back

540
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,520
by Dango.

541
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,280
And Dango

542
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,120
is the third debater.

543
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,280
Her ability of summarizing is not enough.

544
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,120
The summary just now

545
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
is her best performance.

546
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,280
Now, welcome the fourth debater of the positive side

547
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,520
to make a concluding speech.

548
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
Now, the result of the contest

549
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,720
is on my hand.

550
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,160
Next, I announce

551
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,880
the winner of the contest is

552
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,600
the opposing side. Congratulations!

553
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,720
Meanwhile, congratulations to

554
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
Nan Bei, the second debater of the positive side.

555
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,400
He gains the

556
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,600
best debater

557
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,480
in the Welcome Cup Debate Contest.

558
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,280
Good job!

559
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,240
You are better than in high school.

560
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,440
Well. I know you are great.

561
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,280
You don't need to show off on purpose.

562
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,000
Please go away.

563
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
I just want to give you some advice.

564
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm your senior.

565
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,040
I must care about my junior.

566
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,080
Keep practicing.

567
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,560
You can play to this extent.

568
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
It's your best.

569
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,200
I don't know whether you are praising me

570
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,960
or belittling me.

571
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,160
But it's impossible for me to forgive you.

572
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,840
The summary was good.

573
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,720
It's enough.

574
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
Don't be sad.

575
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,520
There is a lot of fun

576
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
in college.

577
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
You can have time

578
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,160
to play, right?

579
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,680
Actually, you

580
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
did a good job.

581
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,080
Right.

582
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,640
You did a good job.

583
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
This is called ups and downs.

584
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,120
It's exciting to have ups and downs.

585
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
Without a fiasco,

586
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,400
how can it be called youth?

587
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,680
You are not so miserable.

588
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,440
You are not miserable.

589
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040
It's a narrow defeat.

590
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
I will invite you to have a meal this weekend.

591
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Hello, who is speaking?

592
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,400
I'm Qiu Lingyan.

593
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,040
We found a box of comic books

594
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
in our training classroom.

595
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,760
Your agent couch said that

596
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,200
it's yours.

597
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
He lets me contact with you.

598
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Well.

599
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,680
Well.

600
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
You leave them there.

601
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
I will go to fetch them.

602
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,640
I got to have a class.

603
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,720
So, I throw them at the door.

604
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,800
How could you do that?

605
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,520
You put them at the door.

606
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,080
What if others

607
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,760
take them away?

608
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,320
Those are signed limited edition.

609
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,480
Hello.

610
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,440
Hello.

611
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,720
You go to the class.

612
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,960
Is Liu Yanze there?

613
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Alas!

614
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,040
What a coincidence!

615
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,840
You have a good taste.

616
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,560
Give them to me.

617
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,200
I have heard of the matter about your team.

618
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,920
Are you okay?

619
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,840
That's it.

620
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,760
I would have wanted to drink to eliminate my sadness

621
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,920
and be drunk for three days.

622
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,760
But When I saw Xiaoyu,

623
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,680
I thought that I would better be strong.

624
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
So does Nan Bei.

625
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,000
After being defeated by Liu Yanze,

626
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,360
he is dispirited, right?

627
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,800
He's recovering from

628
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,640
the post-traumatic stress disorder.

629
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,440
I find there are two types of people

630
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,320
who

631
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,960
suffer shocks.

632
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,040
The first one is like him.

633
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,960
He doesn't move at the dormitory.

634
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,120
But he finds a new hobby.

635
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
Photograph.

636
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,560
Isn't that good?

637
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,040
He will move when taking photos.

638
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,680
Time-lapse photography.

639
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,200
He only takes one picture one night.

640
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,880
He doesn't move all the night, right?

641
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,760
He also moves.

642
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,160
He moves every two hours.

643
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,480
He's sick badly.

644
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,040
Does Xiaoyu belong to his type?

645
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,920
I think she belongs to

646
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,680
the other type.

647
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,400
Xiaoyu

648
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
Are you okay?

649
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,440
I have nothing wrong.

650
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,440
The dopamine produced by labor

651
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,480
fills my body.

652
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,600
I think

653
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,480
I'm very happy.

654
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,360
Xiaoyu, let me help you.

655
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,120
Hao, don't move.

656
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
You do the laundry all the time.

657
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,000
In the future, the activity

658
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,920
is my duty.

659
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
She's striving.

660
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,440
It seems that she's okay.

661
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,240
I have been friends with her for ten years.

662
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,840
I can definitely tell you that

663
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
she's not okay.

664
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,760
Let me tell you first.

665
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,640
The meal today

666
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,440
is absolutely not a dismissal dinner.

667
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,920
No matter we

668
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,080
are members

669
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,600
of the debate team

670
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,760
of Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics,

671
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,760
the group will not be dismissed.

672
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,200
The blue mountains never grow old.

673
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,240
Friendship endures forever.

674
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,320
Cheer!

675
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,640
Come on!

676
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,640
What's this?

677
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,200
It tastes good.

678
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,640
The alcohol with a fruit taste also belongs to alcohol.

679
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,600
It contains alcohol.

680
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Don't be impulsive.

681
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,080
Don't worry. I know it.

682
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,640
Shui, there's no water.

683
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,280
Do you know

684
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,000
what is important in our life?

685
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,840
Striving and struggling.

686
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,560
Don't think that

687
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,920
your life is bad now.

688
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,920
When you are at my age,

689
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,600
There's no water.

690
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,560
you will think time flies

691
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,320
without pausing.

692
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,320
You don't have

693
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,480
the right to order.

694
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,320
What are you saying?

695
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,840
Pavel Korchagin

696
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,480
once said that

697
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,320
She's drunk. Look after her.

698
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,200
When you look back,

699
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,960
you will not be ashamed of your lack of effort,

700
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,800
You continue saying.

701
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
and regret for having wasted your time.

702
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,280
How do you feel?

703
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,120
I send you back home.

704
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,880
I can't remember the rest.

705
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,800
I am not drunk.

706
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,960
Sa, make sure to

707
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,960
take care of them.

708
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,040
I send her back home.

709
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,120
I am not drunk.

710
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,920
Don't hold me up.

711
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,880
You are going to reach the dormitory.

712
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,000
Look.

713
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,080
The tree in front of us

714
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,600
is shaking.

715
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,120
You go to hold it up.

716
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,080
I will stand steadily.

717
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
I will hold it up.

718
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
I will hold it up after holding you up.

719
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,960
Don't move.

720
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,280
Don't move.

721
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,320
Let me lean on you.

722
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,640
Nan Bei

723
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,640
I was defeated by Yin Nan again.

724
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,640
Why do I say again?

725
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,120
Because from the childhood to the adulthood,

726
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,800
I have never defeated her.

727
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,840
Never.

728
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,920
It's okay. Never mind.

729
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,120
But why was I

730
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,600
defeated in the debate?

731
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,480
I like debate the most.

732
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,280
When we first met,

733
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,440
I only wanted to

734
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,240
be a member of the debate team.

735
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,040
Then,

736
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,360
I met you guys.

737
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,560
We can

738
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,720
play together every day,

739
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
prepare for the competition,

740
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,200
and win the competition.

741
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,040
I'm so happy.

742
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,000
Nan Bei

743
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,640
There's no debate team any longer.

744
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,400
Will we be separated?

745
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,280
What are you talking about?

746
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,800
No matter there's a debate team or not,

747
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,120
I will be with you.

748
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,720
Xiaoyu, you are awake?

749
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,560
How did I come back?

750
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,360
Nan Bei sent you back.

751
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
For the first time,

752
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,400
I witnessed that you drank so much.

753
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,800
I mean

754
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,560
Nan Bei is nice.

755
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,480
Right.

756
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,880
He is nice.

757
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,120
Why are you so early?

758
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,560
I thought you would be late as well.

759
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,120
Which page?

760
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,680
Which page?

761
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,560
Stand up. Let's switch the position.

762
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,400
Okay. The class is over.

763
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,440
Follow me.

764
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,480
Why are you walking so fast?

765
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
It's about the matter of last night.

766
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,160
Last night?

767
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,760
What's wrong?

768
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,760
How do you think?

769
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
I don't want to mention it.

770
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,120
I don't think it's necessary to talk about it.

771
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,760
Let it go.

772
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,600
Let's pretend it didn't happen.

773
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,720
Okay.

774
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,080
That's all?

775
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,400
I am going to the dormitory if there's nothing.

776
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,720
Sa

777
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,080
Come to my office.

778
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,360
Okay.

779
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,920
Well.

780
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,760
This time,

781
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
you can take it as a lesson.

782
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,680
Actually, your team performed

783
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,640
not badly.

784
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,200
The condition before...

785
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,520
The idle condition...

786
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,760
Never mind.

787
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,120
I won't say that.

788
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,840
Don't be sad.

789
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,360
There is a matter.

790
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,520
I need to tell you.

791
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay.

792
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
Do you remember

793
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,960
the previous school team?

794
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,920
Yes.

795
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,280
They took part in the provincial competition

796
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,400
to accumulate points.

797
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,000
So, they repeatedly

798
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,720
took part in these

799
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,760
competitions which provide points.

800
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,720
Finally,

801
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,760
they almost failed.

802
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,200
Well.

803
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,760
But

804
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,920
if your points are not enough,

805
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,120
you have no right to take part in the provincial competition.

806
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,200
Uh!

807
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,720
The final goal of

808
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,000
our new school team

809
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,680
is to win

810
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,640
the champion of the provincial competition.

811
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,320
So,

812
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,000
they need

813
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
some time and energy.

814
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
The leaders of our school decided

815
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,800
to organize a team two,

816
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,480
which dedicates themselves to acquire points for them.

817
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,240
Well.

818
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,320
Who do you think

819
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,960
is suitable for the team two?

820
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,320
Well.

821
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,360
I have thought about that for a while.

822
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,720
I think your team is the most suitable one.

823
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,360
What?

824
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,880
Team two?

825
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,840
Right.

826
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,400
Mr. Li, this is not suitable.

827
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,680
Why is it not suitable?

828
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,200
Why is it not suitable?

829
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,400
This is a chance.

830
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,160
What?

831
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Don't think that leading the team two

832
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,280
is embarrassing.

833
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,440
The team one has

834
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,480
half of the merit.

835
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,800
Your team two also has half of the merit.

836
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
Well, Mr. Li, this...

837
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
This is different.

838
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,360
Psychologically, the kids...

839
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,680
So, I let you to

840
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,840
persuade them.

841
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,600
But...

842
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,920
As for an intern,

843
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,200
this is a very good

844
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,360
chance to perform.

845
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,160
Well.

846
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,120
Don't answer me in haste.

847
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,480
I think it's suitable. There's no problem.

848
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,440
Let me know when you've thought about it.

849
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,960
Okay?

850
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,880
Well.

851
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,000
It's okay.

852
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,800
The next one.

853
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
Why is Xiaoyu so angry?

854
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,120
She's so fierce.

855
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,080
This is abnormal.

856
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,840
The more energetic she is,

857
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,960
the more I worry about her.

858
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,920
I have to deal with it.

859
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,520
To deal with it?

860
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,640
Have a talk with her.

861
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,600
If we could persuade her,

862
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,040
she wouldn't be like this today.

863
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,760
Xiaoyu

864
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,280
How about

865
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,320
having a walk together later?

866
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
I know there's

867
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,040
a

868
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,120
new dessert shop nearby.

869
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,520
Call Tao Hao,

870
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
and Nan Bei.

871
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,200
Nan Bei

872
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,200
Don't mention

873
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,080
that scum.

874
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,320
What did Nan Bei do?

875
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,440
The next one.

876
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,800
We only sell drinks.

877
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,760
Food is not sold.

878
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,200
Shui

879
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,480
If I don't save the kid,

880
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,000
it will have to

881
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,120
be eaten at noon today.

882
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,480
Then it dies a worthy death, doesn't it?

883
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,240
Have you ever heard of ducks bring back wealth?

884
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,280
You can put one

885
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,360
drake into

886
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,680
a room sitting in the north and facing the south,

887
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,880
there will be many guests.

888
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,200
The business is prospering.

889
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,400
You will be rich in financial resources.

890
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,200
It will bring more and more guests.

891
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,800
Fine.

892
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,720
As long as you promise

893
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,080
to give me two deals every week,

894
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,080
your son

895
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,480
is in the charge of me.

896
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,000
That's nice of you.

897
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Then I got to go.

898
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,520
You're really here!

899
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,120
What do you want from me?

900
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,480
What's wrong with you and Xiaoyu?

901
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,640
It's no big deal.

902
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Last night,

903
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,920
you sent her back to the dormitory.

904
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,440
Was there anything special?

905
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,360
Nothing. It doesn't deserve to be mentioned.

906
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,480
She's strange today.

907
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,920
She's angry with you.

908
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,720
She's angry with me?

909
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Where is she?

910
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,560
Well.

911
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,240
Xiaoyu

912
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,200
Why do you

913
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,080
hide when you see me?

914
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,360
I come in to change my clothes.

915
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,400
I just finished my training.

916
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,920
Why are you always following me?

917
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,480
I want to talk with you.

918
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,680
According to Dango,

919
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,080
I seemed to annoy you.

920
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,360
I'm not annoyed.

921
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,960
I have nothing to

922
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,640
talk to you.

923
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,080
You go away.

924
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,400
Actually, I know

925
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,080
the reason why you are annoyed.

926
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:29,960
Really?

927
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,520
Yes.

928
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,040
After the dismissal of the debate team,

929
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,160
we didn't

930
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,000
have a good conversation

931
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,440
about what to do in the future.

932
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,640
Maybe you think that

933
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,680
I'm escaping the topic.

934
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,920
To be honest,

935
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,360
I'm a little bit.

936
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,840
People to some extent will

937
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,200
be afraid to face

938
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,720
some sudden changes.

939
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,720
Xiaoyu

940
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Actually, I have figured it out.

941
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,440
We stay together

942
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,640
because we have the common hobbies,

943
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,320
and the same values.

944
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,240
I also believe that

945
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,600
in the future,

946
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
you are in my life.

947
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,720
Because for me,

948
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,200
you are indispensable.

949
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,080
You are an important part of my life.

950
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,280
Really?

951
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,200
What I said comes from my heart.

952
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,160
Well.

953
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,200
We should

954
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
talk clearly about

955
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
what happened last night.

956
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Is that necessary?

957
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
This is my fault.

958
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,600
But I was drunk.

959
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,360
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

960
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,840
So, what do you think?

961
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,600
Well.

962
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,320
I spent 1500 yuan buying them.

963
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,280
You give me 800 yuan.

964
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,840
What?

965
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,080
I tell you not to mention it.

966
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,720
There is no need

967
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,120
to be so polite between us.

968
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,280
We are good friends.

969
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,880
I mean the thing last night.

970
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,520
Right.

971
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,600
It's a matter of last night.

972
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,560
What a mess!

973
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
The shoes.

974
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Don't hold me up.

975
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,840
Look.

976
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,360
The tree in front of us

977
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,120
is shaking.

978
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,760
You go to hold it up.

979
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,400
I will stand steadily.

980
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,200
Let me lean on you.

981
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,800
Hello.

982
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,360
Sa

983
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,160
Dango is back to the dormitory.

984
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,800
I...

985
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,560
Xiaoyu will be later

986
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,080
back to the dormitory.

987
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,960
Nan Bei

988
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Okay, bye. See you later.

989
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,240
I was defeated by Yin Nan again.

990
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,760
Why do I say again?

991
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,080
Because I have never defeated her.

992
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,520
From the childhood to the adulthood, I

993
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,880
have never defeated her.

994
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,600
I have never defeated her.

995
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
But why was I

996
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,280
defeated in the debate?

997
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,280
I like debate the most.

998
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,000
When we first met...

999
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,680
Nan Bei

1000
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,560
Do you think that

1001
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,880
after the dismissal of the debate team,

1002
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,160
will we

1003
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,000
be separated?

1004
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,560
Nan Bei

1005
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,920
Oh, my god.

1006
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,160
Let's go back to the dormitory. Let's go.

1007
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,000
Come on.

1008
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,440
Don't shake me.

1009
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,400
What's wrong with you?

1010
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,480
I will try

1011
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,600
to wipe it out.

1012
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,440
But it's impossible.

1013
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,640
I wanted to

1014
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,760
let it go.

1015
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,400
Do you think that

1016
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,000
I didn't take you as a friend?

1017
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,760
Because I hope you to give me 800 yuan.

1018
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,720
It's cheap to cost you 800 yuan.

1019
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,920
I tell you. The shoes are not the same with the cars.

1020
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,960
The more I wear the shoes, the more expensive the shoes will be.

1021
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
800 yuan is really...

1022
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,840
It's good.

1023
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,720
800 yuan is good.

1024
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,280
Then, don't be annoyed.

1025
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,680
I'm not annoyed.

1026
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,920
I'm refreshed and

1027
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,000
energetic.

1028
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,840
Come on.

1029
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,160
Come with me to practice boxing.

1030
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,720
Okay.

1031
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,040
Don't beat on my face later.

1032
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,720
Impossible.

1033
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,000
Why do you suddenly

1034
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,960
plan to have a team two.

1035
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,120
Our school is going to take part in the provincial competition.

1036
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,640
It needs to obtain points in different places.

1037
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,680
Our school wants to

1038
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,520
share the pressure.

1039
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,680
So...

1040
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
They do not respect us.

1041
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,280
They can decide everything, right?

1042
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,520
They asked us to dismiss the team. Then the team was dismissed.

1043
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,960
They asked us to be team two. Then should we organize the team two?

1044
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,040
I tell you.

1045
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,200
When I am in a room

1046
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,760
with Liu Yanze,

1047
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,720
either of us

1048
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,680
will go to meet the former couch.

1049
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,800
Well, I told that to Mr. Li.

1050
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,040
If you do that like this,

1051
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,200
what should Dango do?

1052
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,360
What?

1053
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,120
Well.

1054
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,080
It's okay with me.

1055
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,120
If you

1056
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,200
want to have the team two,

1057
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,680
I will agree with you.

1058
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,520
Look.

1059
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,360
How embarrassed Dango is!

1060
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,000
What?

1061
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,560
Will the two teams

1062
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,840
fight with each other?

1063
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,560
He didn't tell me.

1064
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,840
Maybe.

1065
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,880
That means it's impossible.

1066
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,080
Will it be possible for the team two

1067
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,160
to become the team one?

1068
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,080
He didn't tell me.

1069
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
That's even more unlikely.

1070
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,080
Stop talking.

1071
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,760
Actually,

1072
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,120
I have

1073
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,640
the same attitude

1074
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,360
with you at first.

1075
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,400
The team two

1076
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,120
is an alternative.

1077
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,520
We were once the team one.

1078
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,800
How shameful a thing!

1079
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,280
But,

1080
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,120
my friends,

1081
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,680
think about it.

1082
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,720
Do we really care

1083
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,160
about the team one or the team two?

1084
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,960
No, we don't.

1085
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,160
What we really care about

1086
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,480
is debate.

1087
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,200
We had

1088
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,040
made a lot of efforts

1089
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,280
to keep our team.

1090
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,240
Now,

1091
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
there is a chance

1092
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,400
in front of us.

1093
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,760
My suggestion is

1094
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,240
to think about it prudently.

1095
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,200
How about this plan?

1096
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,200
You don't need to

1097
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,880
answer me in haste.

1098
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,840
I give you

1099
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,720
a week to think about it.

1100
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,080
We decide it then.

1101
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,920
Okay?
