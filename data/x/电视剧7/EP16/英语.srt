Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP16

2
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,320
Where did you go?

3
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
I bought you something to eat.

4
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,920
Snacks, fruits, and candied fruits.

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,400
When you're bored on the train,

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,200
you can eat them to kill the time.

7
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,440
That should keep you going till you arrive the destination.

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Whose is that for?

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
This is for Dango.

10
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,240
She will try to eat yours,

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,320
so I bought the same stuff for her.

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
You are starting to look like

13
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
a good boyfriend.

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,480
To be a good boyfriend,

15
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,600
I've made three rules for you

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,920
in the winter vacation.

17
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,200
First,

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Call me

19
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
every night.

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
Make sure I can reach you any time.

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,520
Second,

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,960
send a small moon sticker before you sleep,

23
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
and a small sun sticker after you wake up

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,000
to me on WeChat.

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
Third,

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
report to me when you leave your house,

27
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,840
do not drink,

28
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,320
when there're other men around.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,880
This is exactly what my dad said

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,480
when I first entered university.

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
This means that

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,440
we're going to be a family sooner or later.

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,280
- Off with you. - Off with you.

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm back. Let's go.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,000
Here,

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,720
this is for you.

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,040
Take care.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,800
Thank you.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,640
Let's go.

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,720
Bye. I won't see you off.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,600
Goodbye.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,720
Instant noodles.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Dango.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
There's only one left.

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,560
You can take it. I'm not hungry.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,280
What if you get hungry

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
on the train?

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,320
Nan Bei has given me

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,000
so many things to eat.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Take it.

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,840
What a coincidence.

52
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,200
I really...

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
Calm down.

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,240
Seriously?

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
We take the same train?

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,440
There's only one train departing in the morning.

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,680
- Dango! - Dad!

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
Dad!

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
Where's mum?

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Your mum

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,120
is cooking for you at home.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,840
Why don't you

63
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,200
hitch a ride in my car?

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,920
I appreciate it, Uncle.

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,880
But my mother will be here soon.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
My mom as well.

67
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Alright. Take care then.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,800
Okay.

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Xiaoyu,

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,400
I will visit you in a few days.

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
Watch what you eat.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,560
Don't gain weight.

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,400
Alright.

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,480
Goodbye.

75
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:19,880
Girls,

76
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
take care of yourself.

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,520
Goodbye, Uncle.

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,000
Bye!

79
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,880
Be careful on the road.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
See you later, Uncle!

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,840
Baby girl,

82
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,400
I have gotten your arrival date wrong.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
Get a taxi home.

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,560
My baby.

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:46,960
Mum!

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
You're back!

87
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,400
Yin Nan?

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Hi, Auntie.

89
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,800
Where's your mother?

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,040
Something came up at the last moment,

91
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,520
so she couldn't make it.

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
Auntie, I'm calling a cab.

93
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,040
Come, let me send you back.

94
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,600
Mum, why

95
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,760
did you ignore me

96
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,480
and talk to Yin Nan only?

97
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,120
It's alright, Auntie.

98
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
I can go back myself.

99
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Aren't we living in the same neighborhood?

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,040
why bother calling a cab?

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
Come, let's help her with her luggage.

102
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Why?

103
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,920
She can do it herself.

104
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,200
Why do I need to help her?

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
That's because you're strong.

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,400
I've arrived.

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,200
- On my way home. - You just

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,960
can't keep your eyes from your phone.

109
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,640
You're going to ruin your eyes.

110
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,360
You should learn from Yin Nan.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,240
Today, your dad

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
bought a cod for you.

113
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,760
I'll fry it for you for dinner.

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't wanna eat fish. I want meat.

115
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
That's the reason

116
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,160
why you are not smart.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,920
Yin Nan is unlike you.

118
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,320
She eats fish a lot.

119
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,920
It has nothing to do with her.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
I inherit it from you.

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,200
Do you?

122
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,320
I asked you to take up Finance,

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
but you chose International Trade.

124
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,080
Yin Nan had also chosen International Trade.

125
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,440
Didn't you say it's great, too?

126
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
You two are different.

127
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,720
The prospect of you finding

128
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
a job upon graduation

129
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
worries me and your daddy a lot.

130
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
Why bother

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,960
worrying about that?

132
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
I can deal with it myself.

133
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Look at you, can you ever grow up?

134
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,680
Can't you learn from Yin Nan?

135
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,960
You manage to displease your mother

136
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,840
the first day you're back.

137
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,040
I've waited for you for half a year.

138
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,920
So funny.

139
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,080
Every time I come back,

140
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,880
you will start to hate my guts

141
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,680
in less than a week.

142
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,800
What are you talking about?

143
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,400
Just wait and see.

144
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Have some fruits. They're full of nutrition.

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,960
Thank you, mum.

146
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,240
You don't have these at school, right?

147
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,080
Barely scrape by.

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,040
I don't mind food.

149
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,280
What are you talking about?

150
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,240
Xiaoyu.

151
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,360
Are you awake?

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
It's time for lunch.

153
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,320
I'm still sleepy.

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Fine. You continue.

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,320
I know it's hard at school.

156
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,960
Mummy

157
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
will come again after half an hour.

158
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,480
Mum, I want to eat some fruits.

159
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,680
Mum, I want to eat some fruits!

160
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
Can't you wash some yourself?

161
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
I'm busy? Don't you see?

162
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,040
What else can you do

163
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
except for playing with your phone

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
and creating trash?

165
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,600
What time is it now?

166
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,440
Get up.

167
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,960
Come and help me.

168
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm still sleepy.

169
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,320
Wake up.

170
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,240
Hurry.

171
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Put these clothes

172
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
in the washing machine.

173
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,360
Do you hear me?

174
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,400
Xiaoyu.

175
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,200
What happened?

176
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,480
I was nagged by my dad the whole morning.

177
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,680
Zishi,

178
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,360
did you come because you smell the food?

179
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,280
Come.

180
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,080
Eat with us.

181
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
How are you, Auntie?

182
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,040
Fine, good girl.

183
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,240
I'll go get the rice.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
You dare to take it away?

185
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,520
You won't have enough anyway.

186
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
Here's your rice.

187
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,320
Auntie, I can't finish all these.

188
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,440
I know how much

189
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,640
you normally eat.

190
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,200
Are you trying to lose weight

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
because you've fallen in love?

192
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
Come and tell me.

193
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
Did our Xiaoyu

194
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,840
get a boyfriend at school?

195
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,280
Both of us are good girls.

196
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
How can that ever happen?

197
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
That's good. Eat.

198
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,080
Why are you so quiet today?

199
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Normally, you're very talkative.

200
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,880
It's nothing.

201
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Actually,

202
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,160
it's about choosing my major at school.

203
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,920
Actually, I love painting

204
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,840
but my parents want me

205
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,880
to choose editing.

206
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,440
I... Ah!

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Your dad wants the best for you.

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,240
You should listen to your parents.

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,320
They'll never be wrong.

210
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,400
But I like painting.

211
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,280
You kids

212
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,320
are too spoiled.

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,120
You do whatever

214
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
you want.

215
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,560
You don't have any experience.

216
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
You should listen to your parents.

217
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,920
What parents do is for their kids' good.

218
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,920
Mum,

219
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
If you get a problem with me, bring it to me.

220
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,480
Don't bully Dango.

221
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
You call this bullying?

222
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,960
Zishi is not an outsider.

223
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,800
Then I'll

224
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,840
speak it out.

225
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Your Dad and I

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,480
have done our research.

227
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,840
This International Trade major

228
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,040
is like an aircraft carrier.

229
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,640
You have to learn everything.

230
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,920
It doesn't specialize in any field.

231
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
After you graduate,

232
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,000
it's as if you know everything

233
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,440
but know nothing.

234
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,160
In the end,

235
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,080
you'll gain no expertise

236
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,080
to help you find a job.

237
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,680
Where did you

238
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,640
get all your big data research from?

239
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,040
I want to ask you.

240
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
So, you know my major

241
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,480
better than I do?

242
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,160
I've checked all the statistics

243
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,880
on the employment

244
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,520
for International Trade and Finance majors

245
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,680
of all schools under 985 Project.

246
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
I know more than anyone else,

247
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,600
the statistics of these two majors.

248
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,560
Can big data predict our future?

249
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
I have good grades.

250
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm the top three in our year.

251
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,240
I've obtained first class scholarship

252
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,200
for two years in a row.

253
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,320
If our school is going to recommend students for internships,

254
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
I can choose any post I want.

255
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,800
What age is this?

256
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Why can't I find a good job?

257
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Am I right, Dango?

258
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,920
Dango, what do you think?

259
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,240
Guangzhou's 1700 mu (280.1acres) land

260
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
has been completely levelled.

261
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,920
Next, it's going into

262
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,240
the large-scale construction phase.

263
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
This will strengthen the bond between Macau and Hong Kong, with Australia

264
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,680
and propel the development of the Greater Bay Area.

265
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,000
After the framework agreement has been established...

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,400
Bei,

267
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,800
Have you made your mind

268
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
in what major to choose?

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,160
What's there to think about?

270
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,040
I'll choose Intellectual Property Law.

271
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Good. This is good.

272
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,560
Bei.

273
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,040
Yes.

274
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,280
We support your decision,

275
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,120
but have you considered

276
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,520
something like Civil Law

277
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,560
or Economic Law?

278
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,560
I'm not interested in those.

279
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,960
So you decide on such a big thing

280
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,200
based on your interests?

281
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,480
Mum,

282
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,120
let me make own decisions

283
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
on my studies.

284
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,800
Additionally,

285
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,160
I've already studied for two years.

286
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
Just believe in me.

287
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,520
Whatever.

288
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,720
Go and wash the dishes.

289
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,920
I still have something to do at nine o'clock.

290
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,280
Then make it quick.

291
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,080
Alright.

292
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
What are you still doing here?

293
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm going to help Bei.

294
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,920
What are you doing?

295
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,840
I'm watching a debate competition.

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So hardworking?

297
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,680
How about you?

298
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,320
I'm also watching a debate competition.

299
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,440
Have you

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
contacted Ma Nan, Tao Hao,

301
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,120
and the others?

302
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,280
Sometimes.

303
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,320
Sending some WeChat messages and red packets.

304
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,680
Ah, yes.

305
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,920
My parents

306
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,720
just talked to me

307
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,320
about my major.

308
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,840
They're still using

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,280
their usual flanking tactics.

310
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,880
After the failure,

311
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,280
I guess

312
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,640
they're planning something.

313
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,400
At least you can still talk

314
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,560
normally with your parents.

315
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,760
What happened?

316
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,560
Are your parents

317
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,160
selectively ignoring your

318
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,240
opinions?

319
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,240
Um...

320
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,960
I'm not saying it.

321
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,760
Why not?

322
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,320
Isn't it my duty

323
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,080
to help you when you're down?

324
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,160
It's hard to explain on WeChat.

325
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,680
I'm not saying it.

326
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Then, tell me what should I do

327
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,200
to make you happy?

328
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,600
Say something nice.

329
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,520
What can I do to make you happy, your highness?

330
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,680
I'm going to beat you.

331
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,080
Xiaoyu, come and have some fruits.

332
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,720
Your mum has something to say to you.

333
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,320
See?

334
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,520
The war horn has been blown.

335
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,160
Um, don't fight. Stay calm.

336
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,120
I'll try.

337
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Put your phone on loud speak,

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,840
Avoid a confrontation with them.

339
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,480
I'm resourceful.

340
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,200
I will help you when the time comes.

341
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,640
What do I need you for?

342
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,600
You're not here

343
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,280
when I need you.

344
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,680
Father? Mother?

345
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm back.

346
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,600
These are my report cards

347
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,320
for the past three semesters.

348
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
My marks fulfill

349
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,280
all the standards for employment recommendation.

350
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,520
I won't have any problem

351
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,160
finding a job after graduation.

352
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,320
An International Trade major takes up a job

353
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,800
related to foreign trade.

354
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,520
What they teach you in school

355
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,440
is not specialized enough.

356
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,320
In the end, you won't have any expertise.

357
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,280
No company will receive you.

358
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,080
An International Trade major

359
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,440
can work in international trade and

360
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
business administration departments

361
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,240
as well as foreign corporations,

362
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,040
joint ventures,

363
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,800
and large-scale retailers.

364
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,480
Do your statistics tell you that?

365
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,880
Just by knowing some English,

366
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,320
and some jargon,

367
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,200
you dare to call yourself an expert in International Trade?

368
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
The barrier to this profession

369
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,520
is too low.

370
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,120
Unless, you want to work as a laborer?

371
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,480
University education

372
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,040
is meant to let students

373
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,080
understand what they can do

374
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,200
when they're studying.

375
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,160
Mum, do you understand

376
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,720
my capabilities better than I do?

377
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,720
Maybe your data

378
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,040
is reliable in some ways,

379
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
but how would you know

380
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,560
if I'm definitely going to be a laborer?

381
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,480
How would you know

382
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,080
that I will fail in everything?

383
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,240
Xiaoyu.

384
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,600
You have to listen to us.

385
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,520
We're experienced.

386
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,760
What we do is for your good.

387
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,040
Everything will be fine if you listen to us.

388
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,320
You always guilt-trip me

389
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,280
whenever you fail to win an argument against me.

390
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,600
Whenever I want to express an opinion,

391
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
you will start to repeat these.

392
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,480
You don't understand my major at all,

393
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,880
and you don't even understand what I want.

394
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,120
When you said it's correct, it's correct.

395
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,600
When you said it's wrong, it's wrong.

396
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,560
Have you ever thought about me?

397
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,880
I have my own standards

398
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,960
and my own principles.

399
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,760
This matter

400
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
is out of your capabilities.

401
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,200
Mum.

402
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,080
This is not like when I'm little

403
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,880
and caused some trouble,

404
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,600
you only need to talk to the teacher

405
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
and settle it.

406
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,800
She is right.

407
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,120
Hello?

408
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,280
I hear the sound of the elevator.

409
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,040
Where are you going this late at night?

410
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,880
Nothing.

411
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,840
I just want to calm down, alone.

412
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,800
What Mr. Wang said just now,

413
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,760
I think it's practical.

414
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,920
Yeah.

415
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,840
Nan, you're back by yourself.

416
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,640
How's school?

417
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,520
It's fine.

418
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
Let me check my mails.

419
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,800
Nan, have you had dinner?

420
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,400
Yes.

421
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,800
Well,

422
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,840
I told you the other day

423
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
that my school gave me an opportunity

424
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,840
to work as an intern at the Big Four after I graduate,

425
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,760
But,

426
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,000
I want to do a startup with some of my friends.

427
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,200
What do you think?

428
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,720
What did you say?

429
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,600
I want to do a startup instead of an internship.

430
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
What's your advice?

431
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,560
You can decide it on your own.

432
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,040
Dad, what do you say?

433
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,840
You're not young anymore.

434
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,000
You need to decide

435
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,840
on your own.

436
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
You're

437
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,960
outstanding since young.

438
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
We are very proud.

439
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,320
Are you proud, or just feel pleased that I save you from troubles?

440
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,640
I understand you're busy.

441
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,680
I knew that when I was a child.

442
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,480
So, I will solve everything

443
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,480
by myself.

444
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
However, no matter how much I try,

445
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,400
I couldn't accept

446
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,040
attending my graduation ceremony alone.

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,880
No matter how outstanding I am,

448
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,080
I'm still a student.

449
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,920
I don't have any work experience.

450
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,880
I don't really need

451
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,280
you to do anything for me,

452
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,000
but I really hope you can at least care about me

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,960
or give me some advice.

454
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,120
Is that too much?

455
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,920
Nan.

456
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,680
It's our fault.

457
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I don't need

458
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,880
your apologies anymore.

459
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
Nan, where are you going this late?

460
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,080
Nan?

461
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,960
Mummy, look!

462
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,360
There's a fountain at the square.

463
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,760
Can we go and have a look?

464
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,480
But, Mummy

465
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,680
needs to go shopping today.

466
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,560
How about tomorrow?

467
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,360
Alright.

468
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,160
Alright.

469
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
Mummy will go to the fountain with you today.

470
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,400
I will go to the mall tomorrow.

471
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:16,960
Let's go.

472
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,920
Yay!

473
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,280
Do you have a problem?

474
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,280
Don't you know?

475
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,760
You can get rid of your hiccup with a startle.

476
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,080
Who's afraid of you? Childish.

477
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,240
This is a public place.

479
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,040
Please keep quiet.

480
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,600
Owner,

482
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,240
why aren't there any soy sauce

483
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,040
on the shelves?

484
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,640
Soy sauce?

485
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,280
Hold on.

486
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,600
Let me have a look at the back.

487
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,240
Thank you.

488
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,720
I don't really want to talk

489
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,200
to you.

490
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,160
But since we met,

491
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
I want to tell you,

492
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,640
my mum said

493
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,960
we would go to your house for a new year visit

494
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,440
in two days

495
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm warning you,

496
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,920
don't say anything about choosing our majors.

497
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,040
That's all. I'm leaving.

498
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,160
My mother won't care

499
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,560
about these little things.

500
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,000
Instead,

501
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,320
I think Auntie

502
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,400
will be more interested

503
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,600
about that fellow

504
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,520
who always hangout with you.

505
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,520
Yin Nan, I will sue you for defamation.

506
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,880
If you dare to talk to my mum about this,

507
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,160
I will tell your mum

508
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,440
that at school,

509
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,200
you always...

510
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
You are not only old,

511
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,440
but also bad-tempered.

512
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,400
Won't auntie be pleased

513
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,080
if she knows someone likes you?

514
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Why do you talk so much?

515
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,400
You're annoying.

516
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,840
Isn't it nice to annoy you?

517
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,120
Since your intelligence

518
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,680
did not keep up with your age.

519
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,160
You need someone to take charge of you.

520
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
You need someone to take charge of you, too.

521
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,040
Who comes out to buy soy sauce this late at night?

522
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,880
You don't have any adults at home?

523
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,560
Do you think everyone is like you?

524
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,840
You giant baby.

525
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,800
What?

526
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,680
When are you coming?

527
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,280
Next Wednesday.

528
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,200
Auntie didn't tell you?

529
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,640
So, she didn't.

530
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,880
How nice.

531
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,560
Not like my mum.

532
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Alas.

533
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,560
She nags me every day.

534
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,160
She's just like my manager.

535
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,760
Wanting to control everything I do.

536
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,680
24 hours a day.

537
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,480
They are just worried

538
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,280
about you.

539
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,080
Stop.

540
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,840
I know what you wanna say.

541
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,280
Let me tell you this.

542
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm already an adult.

543
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
I'm twenty.

544
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,120
I've grown up.

545
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,760
I can

546
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,920
be responsible for my own choices.

547
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,320
Be happy about it.

548
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,080
Do you know how fortunate

549
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,960
you are?

550
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,760
I've never been cared

551
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,840
ever since childhood.

552
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,560
I don't even know

553
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,440
how does it feel like.

554
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,920
Young lady, here's your soy sauce.

555
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,800
Come to pay here.

556
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,440
Son.

557
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,640
The major you choose.

558
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,440
Intellectual Property Law.

559
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,640
I heard that it's a harsh job.

560
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,720
Considering my intelligence and talents,

561
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,600
is that really an issue?

562
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,760
After all, I'm your son.

563
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,120
Don't make fun.

564
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,640
I heard

565
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,400
that these cases

566
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,320
usually take up to several years.

567
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm afraid that you will starve.

568
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,640
At that time,

569
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,680
won't you feel bad for me?

570
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,480
Don't worry.

571
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,000
If I really starve,

572
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,080
you only need to give me

573
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,520
eight or nine hundred thousand yuan.

574
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,560
That'll be fine.

575
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,360
I'm serious about this.

576
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,960
Stop looking at your phone.

577
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,000
Bei.

578
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,960
Your Mum is worried about you.

579
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,600
She heard from your uncle

580
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,920
that if you learn Financial Law, you can work in a big company

581
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
as a consultant.

582
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,280
And

583
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,240
you can also work as a legal advisor

584
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,480
Why is uncle

585
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,040
still so childish?

586
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,160
Stop talking nonsense.

587
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,800
Welcome.

588
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,640
Come in.

589
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,280
Come in.

590
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,240
We've been waiting for you.

591
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,640
Please come in.

592
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,760
Bei.

593
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,480
Hi, Uncle and Auntie.

594
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,280
How are you, Bei?

595
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,680
Happy New Year.

596
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,840
Happy New Year.

597
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,560
Happy New Year.

598
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,040
Bei.

599
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,160
You need to choose your major when school re-opens, right?

600
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,760
That's what we call choosing the direction of your future.

601
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
Something like that.

602
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
We don't know

603
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,920
anything about law,

604
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,120
so we can't give any recommendations.

605
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,040
Didn't your son's girlfriend

606
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,000
graduate from law school

607
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,040
two years ago?

608
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,880
That girl is outstanding.

609
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,880
She's practicing law in a big company.

610
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,480
She earns a lot

611
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
and her work is not so tiring.

612
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,040
Being a legal advisor in a big company

613
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,200
is not that easy.

614
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,640
But,

615
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,440
Bei can deal with it since he gets good grades.

616
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,440
Ah, yes.

617
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,960
She studied Financial Law.

618
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,640
My son should choose

619
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,520
whatever he likes.

620
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,000
Right?

621
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,200
No,

622
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,400
it's about his future.

623
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,480
If he chooses the wrong major,

624
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,000
he'll face a lot of difficulties in the future.

625
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,640
Back then,

626
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,120
Wang who lives at the entrance of our neighborhood

627
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,040
and normally take up small cases,

628
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,840
managed to receive a big case.

629
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,480
Something about copyright.

630
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,360
But it turned out that case

631
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,840
took several years.

632
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
Up until now, he's still complaining about earning little money.

633
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,720
It's distressing.

634
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,080
Is it that serious?

635
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,640
Of course.

636
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,840
Bei,

637
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
you must choose carefully.

638
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,120
Your major

639
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,400
sounds great.

640
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
Something about copyright

641
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
but the law pertaining to this field

642
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,920
is not so complete.

643
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,240
Otherwise,

644
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,760
how could it take so long?

645
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,800
What auntie said is correct.

646
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,480
Though he comes first

647
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,160
this year,

648
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,120
his scholarship

649
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,680
is only enough for him to retake one exam.

650
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,200
He's still to pass

651
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,800
the Moral Cultivation and Legal Basis.

652
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,080
It's his third attempt.

653
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,800
It's even an open-book exam.

654
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,760
You have to look into this.

655
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,800
Uncle,

656
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,720
has your daughter found a job yet?

657
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,960
She's been waiting at home

658
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,720
for over a year now.

659
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,040
Why didn't you bring her here for dinner?

660
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,960
I miss her.

661
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,640
What are you talking about? Did you drink too much?

662
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,360
Come on, let's eat.

663
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:10,920
Come.

664
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,920
Auntie. Uncle.

665
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,320
Stay safe.

666
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
Alright. See you.

667
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,960
Take care.

668
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,640
Come again.

669
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Mum.

670
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,480
You're busy all the day. Eat some grapes.

671
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,400
I was

672
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
just kidding.

673
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,680
It's not the first time

674
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,560
they know me.

675
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,280
They won't stay upset for long.

676
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I did not mean it as well.

677
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,360
I got too high.

678
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
They are saying it for your own good.

679
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,400
Additionally,

680
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
they're not wrong.

681
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,680
I know what you meant.

682
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,680
You're kicking the ball here and there,

683
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
it's suffocating.

684
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,320
If you want me to change my major,

685
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
just tell me.

686
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,360
You've invited for so many people to come.

687
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,200
You've talked my ear off.

688
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,960
Alright.

689
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,920
Anyhow, we think

690
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
that being a legal advisor is better for you.

691
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,400
Yes, you're right.

692
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,560
Alright.

693
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,440
Then,

694
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,880
tell me why is it suitable.

695
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,520
A legal advisor in a big company,

696
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,680
is a stable job

697
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,120
It's not stressful as well.

698
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,280
From nine to five.

699
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,840
As simple as that.

700
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,400
What's wrong with that?

701
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,160
You've also heard what your auntie said.

702
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
Intellectual property is a difficult field.

703
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,800
This type of legal cases take a long time.

704
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,920
It's very difficult.

705
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,520
What are you looking for?

706
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,080
So, you really think that being a legal advisor of a big company

707
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
is safe and stable?

708
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,080
You only need to sit back

709
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,280
and drink your tea?

710
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,960
So, where's the prospect

711
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,160
for advancement?

712
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,360
You must take a long-term view.

713
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,720
Then, what about being a legal consultant?

714
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,480
Mum, you've watched TV series, right?

715
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,040
Which legal consultant

716
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,720
in the TV series

717
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,480
isn't bald

718
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,400
even when they're only fifty?

719
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,800
It's not that simple.

720
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,600
It's harder than copyrights.

721
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm no match to you in arguing.

722
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,400
No, Mum.

723
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,280
It's not about that.

724
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,040
You don't understand.

725
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
So, don't worry about this.

726
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,120
Leave it to me. I can do it.

727
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,160
It's getting late.

728
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,680
You should go to rest.

729
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,560
I'll go to sleep.

730
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,160
Sleep?

731
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,520
Go clean up the table.

732
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,280
Alright.

733
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
Baby, I'm coming in.

734
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,480
Wow.

735
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
Your room is too dim.

736
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,000
It's going to ruin your eyesight.

737
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,520
Your face is big,

738
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
you don't look good with glasses.

739
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,800
You won't be able to woo a prince charming.

740
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,280
Dad, having a big face means I bring fortune.

741
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,400
Just like you.

742
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,000
Dad, let me show you.

743
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,600
The boys in this comic

744
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,480
are very handsome.

745
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,840
They don't look as good as me.

746
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,360
Dad.

747
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,200
Look at this.

748
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,600
Does this look good?

749
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
This is a bear, right?

750
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,920
It's you.

751
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Let me see.

752
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,680
It looks like me.

753
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,000
It looks like me...

754
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,000
Daughter.

755
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,360
Are you sure

756
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,920
you want to take comic design?

757
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,760
You don't want to support me?

758
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,720
Daddy will support

759
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
whatever decisions you make,

760
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,280
but I feel that

761
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,200
we

762
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,160
should do what

763
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,600
we are good at.

764
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,120
Treat what you love to do

765
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,200
as a hobby.

766
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,440
Then,

767
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,440
you will live happier.

768
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
So, regarding this matter,

769
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,920
is it an order

770
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,760
or a suggestion?

771
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,920
Of course, we can discuss this.

772
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,840
But your mum said

773
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,280
you have to think of three

774
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,800
strong reasons

775
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,280
to persuade us.

776
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Daughter, do your best.

777
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,320
Sleep early.

778
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,840
It doesn't look like him?

779
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,400
I think it does.

780
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,040
Xiaoyu.

781
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,040
She's not returned.

782
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,040
Should we go and find her?

783
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,120
Give her classmate

784
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,080
a call.

785
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,800
Should we talk to her now?

786
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,560
Wait.

787
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,160
Hurry.

788
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,200
I've found it.

789
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,760
Wow.

790
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,560
There's a lot.

791
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,480
Intellectual property.

792
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,240
Copyright, trademark,

793
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,040
copyright dispute.

794
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,800
These are quite difficult.

795
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm even more worried now.

796
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,120
But we can't persuade him.

797
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,080
So worrisome.

798
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,200
Why don't we let him do what he wants?

799
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,080
Believe in him.

800
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,720
Am I

801
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
someone who doesn't believe in her son?

802
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,880
Stand up...

803
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,520
Let me do it.

804
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,400
You're

805
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,400
too slow.

806
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,600
He didn't tell me

807
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,240
what's in his mind.

808
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I'm worried that

809
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,160
if he makes his decision rashly

810
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,600
he will regret later.

811
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,520
Here.

812
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,200
See if there's anything

813
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,240
supported with statistics.

814
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,600
Yes.

815
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,600
Here.

816
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,720
This one.

817
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,200
I'm still searching.

818
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,800
Stop interrupting.

819
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,200
Look.

820
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,920
Did you get addicted to the net at such an old age?

821
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,640
You scared me.

822
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You didn't make any sound when you walk in.

823
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
We're just browsing something.

824
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,880
What are you looking at?

825
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,760
Nothing.

826
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,080
Even if your son

827
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,200
is talentless,

828
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,040
I can still rely on my face.

829
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,640
Yes.

830
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,960
Just like me.

831
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,760
You're anxious

832
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,240
because of my major,

833
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,080
right?

834
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,120
No, I'm not anxious.

835
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,280
How can I not be anxious?

836
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,120
Bei, Mum is too anxious.

837
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
Yes. We're anxious.

838
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,200
You should have said earlier.

839
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,320
You don't need to put up this act.

840
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,720
Sit down.

841
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,400
Sit.

842
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,640
Let me tell you.

843
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,280
Here.

844
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,560
Come and have a look.

845
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,480
Intellectual Property Law

846
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,680
requires someone

847
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,440
who is proficient

848
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,160
at management and law.

849
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,960
At the same time,

850
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,640
it requires some knowledge on science and technology.

851
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,120
It's that hard?

852
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,680
Yes.

853
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,960
So,

854
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,240
regardless if

855
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,120
I'm going to work in this field,

856
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,360
I can rely on my skills

857
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
to take care of this household.

858
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,120
Bei, regarding your job...

859
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,280
Dad, don't rush.

860
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,800
In the future,

861
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,400
I can work

862
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
in a law firm,

863
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,960
or a company that deals

864
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,040
with patents,

865
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,760
or copyrights.

866
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
Additionally, our country

867
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,720
is starting to pay attention to intellectual property rights.

868
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,080
Talents like me

869
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,840
will do very well in the future.

870
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I saw on the news

871
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,880
that there's a novel

872
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,760
that's adapted into a TV series.

873
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,600
In the end, the author

874
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,840
got into a legal suit with the screenwriter.

875
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,680
You see,

876
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,600
we're needed everywhere.

877
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,960
So, you don't need to worry.

878
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,680
No,

879
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,360
we're not worried at all.

880
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,600
I know you can make the right decision.

881
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,000
It's your father's fault.

882
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,440
Who was the one who said she's anxious?

883
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,000
So, I say

884
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,360
our Bei

885
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,800
can plan on his own.

886
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Do what you want.

887
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,160
Don't listen to your mum's nagging.

888
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,440
Hello?

889
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,320
Hi, princess.

890
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,280
You finally pick up your phone.

891
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,960
Let me share something good for you.

892
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,800
Just now,

893
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,040
I used my superior intelligence

894
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,400
to stop

895
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,520
a world war.

896
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,680
My parents

897
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,120
are completely

898
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,800
enticed

899
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,240
by my charm.

900
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:41,920
Yes.

901
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,040
Why do I feel

902
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,960
as if you're trying to brush me off?

903
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,920
Yes.

904
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,360
Are you still angry?

905
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,720
Don't run away from home, alright?

906
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,800
As an ambitious youth,

907
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,440
I'll fight for what I pursue

908
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,240
till the end.

909
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,240
What are you doing on the first day of New Year?

910
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
Are you trying to help scammers earn their KPI?

911
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,840
Where are you now?

912
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Where else? I'm at home.

913
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
It's the first day of New Year.

914
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
It's expensive to stay in a hotel.

915
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,680
But, I'm telling you,

916
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,320
I've planned

917
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,040
to leave early in the morning.

918
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,720
I have my tempers, too.

919
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,080
What are you saying?

920
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,680
Hey, listen to me.

921
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,920
Don't ever run away from home.

922
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,040
If you might get kidnapped,

923
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,680
What should I do?

924
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,160
What can I do?

925
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,840
Are you going to make me worried to death?

926
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,960
It's hard to explain on the phone or WeChat.

927
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,320
Anyway, don't worry.

928
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,040
I've done this before.

929
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,680
It's all under control.

930
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,640
I'm preparing for

931
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,840
battle.

932
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,600
See you.

933
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,800
Bei.

934
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,000
We've run out of toilet paper.

935
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,960
Can you go down and buy some?

936
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,000
Bei? Did you get them?

937
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Are you surprised?

938
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,280
Why did you come?

939
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,520
You said

940
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,240
you'll be more frustrated if

941
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,920
I'm not around

942
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,800
when you need me.

943
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,360
Then, I can only

944
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,320
come to your side.

945
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,200
Isn't your house far away from mine?

946
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
How did you get here?

947
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,680
♪ With the majestic hymn of victory ♪

948
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,040
♪ We sing in praise of our beloved motherland ♪

949
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,880
♪ Toward a prosperous and strong nation ♪

950
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,520
It's alright.

951
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,080
It's not that far from here.

952
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,120
I feel better with your around.

953
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,840
What did you say?

954
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,040
I feel better with your around.

955
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,760
Oh.

956
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,160
However,

957
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,480
it will be more appropriate

958
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,160
if you can

959
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,960
squeeze some tears out right now.

960
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,000
I dare you to say it again...

961
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,600
Ouch...

962
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,760
It's alright.

963
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,320
If you want

964
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,000
to run away from home again,

965
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,440
you can come to my house.

966
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,920
My parents will be extremely happy to meet you.

967
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,000
Off with you.

968
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,240
You and your wishful thinking.

969
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,440
However,

970
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,080
I just realized two days ago,

971
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,640
that parents don't necessarily

972
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,840
want you to listen to them.

973
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,560
They're just worried that

974
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,560
you might regret walking down the wrong path.

975
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,760
So, they will try various methods,

976
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,440
various channels

977
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,360
to obtain these random information

978
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,160
just to be a little closer

979
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,800
to us.

980
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,840
So,

981
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,360
really.

982
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,040
You only need to

983
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,440
reassure them.

984
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,840
But whenever I have an opinion,

985
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,720
she will disagree on this,

986
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,200
disagree on that.

987
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,400
At least let me try.

988
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,240
In the eyes of parents,

989
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,600
we will always be kids.

990
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,040
You only need to let them know

991
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,360
that you've made

992
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,360
your decisions after careful thinking

993
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,720
to make them feel better.

994
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,440
You have to listen, alright?

995
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,040
Don't argue with your parents.

996
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,600
I have to go now.

997
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,520
What's the time?

998
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,680
If I go back a bit later,

999
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,040
my parents will think that

1000
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,600
I've run away from home.

1001
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,200
See you.

1002
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,920
Nan Bei.

1003
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,840
What?

1004
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,040
Look there.

1005
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm just kissing you. Why did you back away?
