Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP15

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
On New Year's Eve

3
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,880
from the opposite sex

4
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,400
if you receive an apple

5
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,080
then be careful.

6
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,520
He is not wishing you healthy

7
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,040
but courting you.

8
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,080
Why not friend WeChat account directly?

9
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,960
Don't these apples taste good?

10
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,280
You don't understand.

11
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,840
Look at you, a hick

12
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
who think that giving apples on New Year's Eve

13
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,960
means wishing someone peace.

14
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,760
Here's one for you.

15
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,680
Do I have to tell you whom you should give it to?

16
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,480
I'm waiting for apples from the opposite sex.

17
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Hum

18
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,400
that's it.

19
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
Boss, are there more apples?

20
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,320
It's the last one over there

21
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,360
because apples sell well these days.

22
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,280
It's not good, so you can get it cheaper

23
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,920
two yuan.

24
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,040
Eat it, it's been washed.

25
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,040
Nan Bei

26
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,280
do you know

27
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,320
what it means

28
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,000
to give apples today?

29
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,720
I know

30
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,560
wish someone peace.

31
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,360
How are you going to celebrate the holidays?

32
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,240
Let's go to the People's Square.

33
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
It's a large place with few buildings surrounding it

34
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,840
and we can also set off fireworks.

35
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,040
So

36
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,120
let's go buy them later.

37
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,640
Nan Bei

38
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,720
Oh

39
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
sorry, I have something to do this afternoon.

40
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,480
You guys just go ahead.

41
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,280
Since it's not night yet

42
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,560
let us

43
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,960
use our time wisely

44
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,480
to prepare.

45
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
Ah.

46
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,480
Hello

47
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,840
do you see it under the table?

48
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,520
Hold on a minute.

49
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,200
I'll be right here.

50
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
Fructose, fructose, fructose.

51
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,920
Low sugar, low sugar, low sugar.

52
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,560
Fibre, fibre, fibre.

53
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,440
Your sacrifice is worth it.

54
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,360
Put the apple on the top.

55
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
What are you doing there?

56
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,560
Auntie, did you find

57
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,000
a stereo?

58
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,920
Auntie, auntie, auntie.

59
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Ah

60
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,720
I'm sorry.

61
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,440
Hello, Hei

62
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,520
I need an apple

63
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,000
not an iPhone worth over 10,000 yuan

64
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
but an edible apple.

65
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,120
Forget it.

66
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,320
I'll get it myself.

67
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,000
Hello

68
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,080
what are you doing now?

69
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm busy right now.

70
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,640
I'll call you later.

71
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,520
Nan Bei

72
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,200
Pay first, don't crowd

73
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,760
and don't snatch.

74
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,720
Boss

75
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,960
do you know

76
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,480
where I can get apples?

77
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
There's an apple orchard over there.

78
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,200
Try your luck there.

79
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,120
That's my bike.

80
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,800
I only borrowed it for a minute

81
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,040
and I'll buy you five kilos of apples tomorrow.

82
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,320
Don't forget to give it back to me.

83
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,840
Uncle

84
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
where's an apple orchard around here?

85
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,040
Do you say the earth is round?

86
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,000
No

87
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,640
I mean where is the apple orchard?

88
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
My last name is not Li.

89
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
Have a rest.

90
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,560
OK.

91
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,640
Boss

92
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,120
here comes the customer

93
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,720
boss.

94
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,280
What are you doing?

95
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,760
Boss

96
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
Stealing apples?

97
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,000
Go, my dog.

98
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,840
Boss

99
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,600
the money is in the basket.

100
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,920
Sorry, sorry

101
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,680
sorry, sorry

102
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,600
sorry, sorry.

103
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,080
Sir

104
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,080
People's Square.

105
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,680
Where's my phone?

106
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,840
Sir

107
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,480
how much is it to go to People's Square

108
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,840
If there's no traffic jam

109
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,560
it's about 30 or 40 yuan.

110
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,000
Relax, young man.

111
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
The bureau of public security is a few hundred meters ahead.

112
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,040
How about taking you there first?

113
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Please don't do that.

114
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,640
Sir

115
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,000
I lost my phone

116
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,640
and ran out of money.

117
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
I'm not looking for a free ride.

118
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,880
I only have 8.9 yuan.

119
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,760
So, can we just

120
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,360
drive for 8.9 yuan?

121
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,680
You look like a student.

122
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,120
The apples

123
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,000
must have just been picked from the orchard.

124
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,320
How about

125
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,640
two yuan for an apple

126
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,560
and count how many apples you have.

127
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,240
All right

128
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,400
one

129
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,760
two

130
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,320
three

131
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,720
four

132
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,560
five

133
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,480
six

134
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,880
seven

135
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,040
eight.

136
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,200
Sir

137
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
there are eight apples in total.

138
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,480
Two yuan for an apple

139
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,280
16 yuan in total

140
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,960
plus this 9.8 yuan

141
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,280
where do you think we can go?

142
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,960
So

143
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,880
I can give you a rock-bottom price.

144
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,400
Later

145
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,280
I'll take you to the street.

146
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,520
For me

147
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
I can drive you for 30 yuan at most.

148
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,480
For the remaining 10 kilometers

149
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,960
you have to rely on yourself.

150
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,160
Thanks.

151
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,160
Hao

152
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,560
You come here so early, Xiaoyu

153
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,120
You too.

154
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,760
Where are Nan Bei

155
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,360
and Dango?

156
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,920
Dango went out to buy fireworks

157
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,720
and she will be back soon.

158
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,920
Nan Bei

159
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,360
Do you know where he has gone?

160
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,200
Did you quarrel again?

161
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
It's not a big deal.

162
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,760
Dandan picked up his phone

163
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,640
and asked me to give it back to him.

164
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,920
He said he saw Nan Bei

165
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,520
being chased by a group of uncles and aunts.

166
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,080
I guess he went to the square dance.

167
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,840
He will be back in a minute.

168
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,080
Don't worry.

169
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,280
I'll buy us something to drink.

170
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,360
OK.

171
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,720
Hey.

172
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,120
Yeah.

173
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,000
Let me ask you something.

174
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Yes.

175
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,560
Do you boys

176
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,440
at the critical moment

177
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,200
fail to do important things?

178
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,440
Do you know

179
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,080
why boys

180
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,040
don't take the initiative now?

181
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Afraid of taking responsibility.

182
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,360
Although gender equality has been promoted

183
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,520
but in a relationship

184
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,400
girls are getting more demanding.

185
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Boys are required to take emotional care

186
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,680
to be attentive

187
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,840
and to act faster than command.

188
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,720
Boys

189
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,800
must be getting stressed out.

190
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,760
Isn't the game fun?

191
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,880
Isn't Internet café attractive?

192
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
Isn't the movie enjoyable?

193
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,400
So until a boy meets the girl

194
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,560
he is willing to give up his time

195
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,200
his freedom

196
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,080
and give all his heart

197
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,280
he usually does not choose to take the initiative.

198
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,560
So?

199
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,520
So if you realize first

200
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,240
the other person

201
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
who makes you willing to give up your time

202
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,600
your freedom

203
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
and give all your heart

204
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,360
then try to take the initiative.

205
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,680
Give me a cup of Chilled Mango Sago Cream with Pomelo, too.

206
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,360
Xiaoyu

207
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,680
Have you brought all the fireworks ?

208
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,920
It's all here, look.

209
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
So many kinds.

210
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,440
Did Nan Bei give you apples?

211
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,160
Maybe

212
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
he is not a romantic person.

213
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
Dango is here, hello.

214
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,120
You've come.

215
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,040
I bought you something to drink.

216
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,560
Hao

217
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
Dango bought many kinds of fireworks

218
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,880
almost everything.

219
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,840
Nan Bei

220
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,400
wow

221
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,560
did you go to the construction site?

222
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,160
What have you been doing all day?

223
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,160
Aren't we going to set off fireworks?

224
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,480
Hurry up

225
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,560
then I'm going back to sleep

226
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,200
come on.

227
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,520
Use a lighter.

228
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,560
OK.

229
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,800
What are you doing?

230
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,640
Keep warm.

231
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
Officer

232
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,280
we've checked that

233
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,080
in the city

234
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,200
fireworks are not allowed.

235
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
But in the north of that building

236
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,320
fireworks are allowed.

237
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,840
In the north of that building

238
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
fireworks are exactly allowed.

239
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,600
But where are you now?

240
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,960
Where?

241
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
This is the south side of the building.

242
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,360
It's not our mistake.

243
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,400
Dealing with cleaning up the mess

244
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,080
just like fireworks

245
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,200
why is it always us?

246
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,680
This is the worst New Year's Eve

247
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,600
I've ever had.

248
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,080
After being criticized

249
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
I have to write a review.

250
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,040
The worst New Year's Eve?

251
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,760
It's better than mine.

252
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,000
What have you been doing all day?

253
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,120
That's all

254
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
and it doesn't make sense.

255
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,640
Well

256
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,400
in the god-forsaken place

257
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,720
isn't there a music fountain?

258
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,960
Where is it?

259
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,640
Now it's

260
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,960
the worst New Year's Eve.

261
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,000
In this case

262
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,240
we can't even set off fireworks.

263
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,280
I want to buy you a gift.

264
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,680
Let me see

265
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,560
if there is anything else I haven't bought.

266
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,440
Is everything ready?

267
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,920
I told you

268
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,400
rise after restrain.

269
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,920
It must be from Nan Bei.

270
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,960
Dango, yours.

271
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh.

272
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,000
Do you know

273
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,320
the meaning of giving apples?

274
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,320
I know.

275
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,760
Is that what I think it means?

276
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,400
Yes.

277
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,240
So, we are

278
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
in a relationship, right?

279
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,480
There they are.

280
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
What are you doing?

281
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,120
The annoying Nan Bei

282
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,280
dragged me here to hide from the officer.

283
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,040
We are trapped by the water.

284
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,360
The water is coming again

285
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,240
wait a minute

286
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
we'll go out when the water stops.

287
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,920
Why do we

288
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,160
need to wait for water to stop to go there?

289
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,080
What?

290
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,560
It's New Year's Eve

291
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,320
come on.

292
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,880
How's it going with you two?

293
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,640
What?

294
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,400
On New Year's Eve

295
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,480
nothing happened?

296
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,200
Yes.

297
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,760
Really?

298
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,120
Stop it.

299
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,400
Everybody please sit down

300
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,800
to listen to the notice.

301
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,240
In the second half of sophomore year

302
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,120
about professional directions

303
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,760
go back

304
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,040
and discuss it with your family.

305
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
After the winter vacation,

306
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,520
give the forms to the monitor.

307
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,240
Professional directions

308
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,560
must be considered comprehensively

309
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,640
for your future work

310
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,600
and career planning

311
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,320
which will play a very important role

312
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,880
okay?

313
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,000
Yes.

314
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,720
Well, keep learning.

315
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,440
How did you two choose?

316
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,760
I

317
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,360
have made up my mind on the first day of college.

318
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,120
I was born

319
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,400
to learn animation design.

320
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,800
So after graduation

321
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm going to be

322
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,080
an independent cartoonist

323
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,040
who, with my works

324
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,680
goes to Japan.

325
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,880
When I come back, I'll be a

326
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,520
famous

327
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,280
and pretty cartoonist.

328
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,160
Well, that's kind of a comic idea.

329
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,880
And you?

330
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,080
Law major.

331
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,000
What's up?

332
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,560
Ha.

333
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,600
Look down on me?

334
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,720
No.

335
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,920
How about you, Xiaoyu?

336
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,480
Do you still want to choose international trade?

337
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,480
Yes.

338
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,800
Between me and my goal

339
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,880
there is always a gap.

340
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,960
Your mom?

341
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:18,960
Yes.

342
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,760
I'm still a little hesitant.

343
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,040
We like this major

344
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,360
so we choose it.

345
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,320
But now

346
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,480
the threshold of cartoonists is quite low.

347
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,400
Frankly speaking,

348
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
most cartoonists

349
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,360
earn a living by their talent

350
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
and luck.

351
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,360
I'm just worried

352
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,120
that I don't have much talent.

353
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,400
I also asked

354
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,720
some graduated students.

355
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,720
Most of them

356
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,640
have changed careers

357
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,280
while others

358
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,480
are now working as painters

359
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,960
and it is difficult to support themselves.

360
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,480
If you like it,

361
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,560
you should firm your will.

362
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,720
After all, the longest day has an end.

363
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,160
Well

364
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,280
Zishi

365
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,720
You stay alone after class.

366
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,240
Alright.

367
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,160
So

368
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,240
in general

369
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,600
I think

370
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,640
you are more suitable

371
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,920
for comic editing.

372
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,840
Of course

373
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,040
the final decision

374
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,400
is up to you.

375
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,080
Go back

376
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,240
and discuss it with your parents.

377
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,760
Yes

378
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,920
I know.

379
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,320
OK.

380
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,120
Your aunt is angry with me.

381
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Is she too narrow-minded?

382
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
Your cousin is in his thirties

383
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,920
but until now

384
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
he has neither bought a dress himself

385
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,080
nor held a formal work

386
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,160
all by his family.

387
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
I said it was time for him to be independent.

388
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,400
Am I wrong?

389
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,200
No

390
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,560
you are right.

391
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,840
He dated his girlfriend for a month

392
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,440
and asked your aunt

393
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,080
for 500,000 yuan to get married.

394
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,360
I said that he lived off his parents.

395
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,320
Am I wrong?

396
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,520
No.

397
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,080
Doesn't he know the economic situation of his family?

398
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,040
Precisely

399
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,280
That's all.

400
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,000
Anyway, you'll be back tomorrow.

401
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,800
Send the train number to your father

402
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,960
and he'll pick you up.

403
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,760
Alright.

404
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,000
My son

405
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,680
why don't you hang up?

406
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,360
There's something I want to tell you.

407
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,240
Now we

408
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
have several professional directions

409
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,440
so

410
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
I want to talk to you.

411
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,320
Let's talk about it when you come back.

412
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
We may not make it clear on the phone.

413
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,640
So

414
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
we'll talk about it when I get back tomorrow.

415
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,680
Ah.

416
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,360
Well.

417
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Did you

418
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,640
hear what Bei said?

419
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,320
Yes.

420
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
He studies law

421
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:53,920
then

422
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,400
what direction would he choose?

423
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,480
No need to guess.

424
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,720
Intellectual property law

425
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,880
which he loved since high school.

426
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,280
Yes, that's it.

427
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,200
Is this a good major?

428
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,760
Not bad, I think

429
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,960
but it is said

430
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,240
that the intellectual property law is imperfect.

431
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,480
Then

432
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
will it be hard to win the cases

433
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,280
and earn money?

434
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,840
He loves it.

435
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,800
To such an important matter

436
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,640
can you pay more attention?

437
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,440
Sure.

438
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,680
What should I do?

439
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,480
Does your colleague Chen's husband

440
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,400
work

441
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,560
in a law office?

442
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,400
Yes, I'll ask.

443
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,280
Nan Bei, where are we going?

444
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,840
Just

445
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,240
go for a walk.

446
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,120
So is it a date?

447
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,120
Yes.

448
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,000
On New Year's Eve

449
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,520
you said you liked me

450
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,840
Is it true?

451
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,200
Yes.

452
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,480
Then we are

453
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,320
a couple

454
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,760
right?

455
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,560
Yes

456
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,440
but

457
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
it's still up to you.

458
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,200
I have to think about it.

459
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,360
Why

460
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,720
why do you have to think about it?

461
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,640
Well

462
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,960
like

463
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,360
what do you like about me.

464
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,800
I like

465
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,440
I like

466
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,960
anyway

467
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,640
it's fun to be with you.

468
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,320
Isn't it because I'm pretty

469
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,440
and lovely, etc.?

470
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,480
Part of it.

471
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,440
Only a part?

472
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,960
No, a lot.

473
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,240
In your heart,

474
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm

475
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,560
beautiful and lovely.

476
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,760
And?

477
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,160
And

478
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,040
you have a good personality

479
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,080
love to laugh

480
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,880
for any worries

481
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,560
you do not really cares.

482
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,840
Whatever you do.

483
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,680
Stop it

484
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,520
I know

485
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,400
but hearing

486
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,880
someone I like say so

487
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,400
is kind of embarrassing.

488
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,960
Is that a yes?

489
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,160
Maybe.

490
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,440
You agree, right?

491
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Let's

492
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,880
make it public.

493
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,240
If they know about it

494
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,200
they will be happy.

495
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,120
Um

496
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
keep it a secret for a while.

497
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,760
Why?

498
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,880
Surely they will be happy.

499
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,600
But in case we...

500
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,720
There is no in case.

501
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,000
I won't

502
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,040
let it happen.

503
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,840
It's okay for people to laugh at us.

504
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,560
But what if they are affected

505
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,200
and can't compete?

506
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,160
How could that happen?

507
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,400
Why not?

508
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,040
If you love another

509
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,840
and hit by me

510
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,040
or I love another

511
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,800
you feel dejected

512
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,520
and left alone.

513
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,600
How do we compete?

514
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,440
Your example

515
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,200
is

516
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,640
very awkward.

517
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,720
So

518
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,880
after adapting period

519
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,880
we'll tell them then.

520
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,760
When's that

521
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,560
going to happen?

522
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,720
After the provincial competition

523
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,920
we'll make it public.

524
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,200
Okay

525
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,720
at most

526
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,280
during this time

527
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:40,920
I

528
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,040
I will be gentle with you.

529
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,120
Fine.

530
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,560
Shall we

531
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,400
have a nickname

532
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,000
in private?

533
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,560
Why?

534
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,680
Because other couples

535
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,160
have nicknames.

536
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,880
So think about it.

537
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,600
There are several nicknames

538
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:11,960
wooden head

539
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,040
Xiwang's mom.

540
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,800
What are these?

541
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,680
Other couple's nicknames

542
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,200
are

543
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,720
baby

544
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,160
honey

545
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,520
something like that.

546
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,240
It's too common.

547
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,920
Really.

548
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
You can try it.

549
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:30,960
I

550
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,360
Try it

551
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,280
try it.

552
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,080
Baby

553
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,760
Stop it.

554
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,640
Did you talk to your parents

555
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,280
about professional directions?

556
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,800
Yes.

557
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,680
Didn't they agree?

558
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,960
They agreed.

559
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,280
How about your mom?

560
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,960
Don't mention her

561
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,240
just talking about her makes my head ache.

562
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,360
So I said that

563
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,440
without perfect preparation

564
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,400
I will absolutely

565
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,080
not start this war.

566
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,640
Pretty good.

567
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,640
When your parents

568
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,600
want to talk to you

569
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,400
just say what you think.

570
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,200
If they agree

571
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,320
then you don't have to talk

572
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,360
which is thoughtful.

573
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,760
If they disagree

574
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
you don't have to talk, too

575
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,880
just discuss it again.

576
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,760
You're an old hand

577
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
who has years of

578
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,080
combat experience.

579
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,000
So

580
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,520
is there a reward?

581
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,800
What reward do you want?

582
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,320
There's nothing.

583
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,440
What are you doing?

584
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,400
So

585
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
drink milk tea together tomorrow.

586
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,080
What flavor would you like?

587
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,640
Strawberry flavor.

588
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,240
What the hell.

589
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,680
Do you know you're wrong?

590
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm not wrong.

591
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,480
You are not wrong?

592
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Now

593
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,160
get out of here.

594
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,840
Don't regret it.

595
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,280
I'll eat your duck tomorrow.

596
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
I'll set your turtle free.

597
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,600
You got it.

598
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
What's going on here?

599
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,840
You best actor

600
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,800
good acting

601
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,120
there will be a reward tomorrow.

602
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,720
Hello, mom.

603
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,640
Xiaoyu

604
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,800
I got your message

605
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,560
What do you think?

606
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,640
I've thought about it

607
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,640
but

608
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,840
I'd like to hear your opinions first.

609
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,680
I consulted with

610
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,160
your uncle in the bank

611
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,960
and your cousin

612
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
in the securities company.

613
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,760
And your dad

614
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,040
on Weibo

615
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,360
also consulted several experts.

616
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,120
We all agree that

617
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,840
you are suitable for finance.

618
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,760
I have considered finance

619
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,080
but I think

620
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,520
international trade might be more suitable for me.

621
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,000
Don't be confused.

622
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,600
In these three hours

623
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,520
mom has prepared a lot of data for you

624
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,680
and analyzed

625
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,000
the big data of financial employment in recent years.

626
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,640
I'll send it to you now.

627
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,080
I'm not confused

628
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,240
and I have consulted the teacher

629
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,240
Why don't you listen to me?

630
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,320
Fine

631
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,560
we'll discuss it when you come back.

632
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,200
What kind of reward, wooden head?

633
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,600
No reward

634
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,320
because of your bad idea.

635
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,360
This is yours

636
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,800
and yours.

637
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,920
I heard that you two

638
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,880
have won the National Award for three years in a row.

639
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,160
Oh, I almost forgot.

640
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,560
This year

641
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,880
The Four Universities give our school

642
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
two places for excellent students.

643
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,120
In principle

644
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,840
I should

645
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,960
recommend senior graduates.

646
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,080
But after I showed them your resume

647
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,800
and grades

648
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,400
they were

649
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,840
very interested in you.

650
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,040
So they decided

651
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,080
to give you a try after the New Year.

652
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,280
Really?

653
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,080
This opportunity

654
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,280
is quite rare.

655
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,080
If you want to graduate early

656
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,840
and become a full member

657
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,440
I can apply for it for you.

658
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,800
I see. Thank you, director Li.

659
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Here's the internship form.

660
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,760
Have a look.

661
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,560
Director Li

662
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,560
It is very important

663
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,120
so I think let Yin Nan

664
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
discuss it with her parents

665
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,720
before making a decision.

666
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,640
Of course, she should discuss it with her parents

667
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
and think about it and then tell me

668
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,480
OK?

669
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,880
Alright, bye, director Li.

670
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
Bye.

671
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,120
Bye, director Li.

672
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,000
Why hesitate about

673
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,000
such a good chance?

674
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,360
Even I want it, too.

675
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,160
You study law

676
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
and I study economics

677
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,920
are you going to take my place?

678
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
I can be a legal personnel

679
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,040
and we'll still be good partners then.

680
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,440
In fact, one of my seniors started

681
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,560
an Internet startup company

682
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,920
and he wanted me to go there next semester

683
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,880
to help start a business together.

684
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,280
I was quite interested in it before.

685
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,880
Although the starting point of the Four Universities is high

686
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,240
startups have more potential.

687
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,240
The two are both good.

688
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,560
If you can't decide

689
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,880
discuss it with your family.

690
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,640
After all

691
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,080
we don't have much experience in work.

692
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,240
Yes

693
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,600
discuss it with my family

694
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,000
but.

695
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,400
It is rare to see her dejected

696
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,920
what happened?

697
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,320
My daughter

698
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,440
it's up to you.

699
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,000
No matter what you choose

700
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,120
mom and dad will support you.

701
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,680
Ah.

702
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,240
Are you being tyrannized by your mom again?

703
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,280
Stop talking about me

704
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,400
and you?

705
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,360
How about you?

706
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,560
My dad opposed

707
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,840
my study of comic design

708
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,280
and asked me to study comic editing.

709
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,440
Your father spoils you so much

710
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,960
but now he opposes you

711
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,240
I guess it's hopeless.

712
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,080
I think

713
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,760
it's hard to deal with this time

714
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,200
it must be a tough battle.

715
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,840
Did you buy a ticket

716
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,040
for the same train with me?

717
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,800
Yes.

718
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,320
I can do anything

719
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
as long as I'm not with her.

720
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,720
Don't worry

721
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,080
there can't be such a coincidence

722
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,760
let's eat.

723
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,320
That's the task

724
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,960
ah.

725
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,160
In this holiday

726
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
don't relax training.

727
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,960
Find the game tapes

728
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,840
analyze

729
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,440
and take a closer look at them.

730
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,320
Sum up the experience

731
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,040
and draw lessons.

732
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,960
Ah

733
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,640
there are also some books I recommend

734
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,880
you can go to the library

735
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,040
to borrow and read them.

736
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,280
Don't worry, coach.

737
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,160
Every day

738
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,040
we spend two or three minutes

739
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,840
no, two or three hours

740
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,720
analyzing.

741
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,760
That's right

742
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,640
don't worry

743
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,760
We will train for sure.

744
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,480
But

745
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,040
later

746
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,280
I'm going to pack up

747
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,400
because I'm leaving tomorrow.

748
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,280
Yes, so don't worry

749
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,440
the information

750
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,080
that you said

751
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,520
we will read them carefully.

752
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
I bet ten yuan.

753
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,000
So do I.

754
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,920
Coach

755
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,720
don't worry.

756
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,600
I'll keep an eye on them.

757
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,560
Take good care of yourself

758
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,200
and watch our game when you get back.

759
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,760
I saw the game tapes last time.

760
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,600
Nan Bei, still the same question.

761
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,680
When you're so excited

762
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,760
you start making personal attacks.

763
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,720
You have to correct it.

764
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,800
Do you know that?

765
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,760
I wonder if the coach has recovered.

766
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,320
Why does he talk so much

767
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,080
right?

768
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Why does it smell like the pig's feet braised in soy sauce?

769
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,240
No.

770
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,280
This one.

771
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,560
There are also bones in this basket.

772
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,320
Give me a chance to explain.

773
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,720
What's going on?

774
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,400
The doctor said

775
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,160
for this disease

776
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,520
I should take more collagen.

777
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,200
So I got a pig hoof.

778
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,080
Well

779
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,240
I think you need to eat

780
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,200
more pig brains.

781
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,560
Pretty good too.

782
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,000
I just don't keep an eye on you these days

783
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,840
You dare do anything

784
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,640
don't you?

785
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
You're so busy reading.

786
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,600
This is

787
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,920
our last day together this year.

788
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,520
Why don't you look at me?

789
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
The books that the coach recommended

790
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,840
this one is not lent out of the library

791
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,240
so I have to write down the key points.

792
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,320
Fortunately, it's not very thick.

793
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,480
But, it must

794
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,160
take a long time.

795
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,880
please stay with me.

796
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,160
Well,

797
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,520
help me.

798
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,640
Let's write together

799
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,040
so it's faster

800
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,720
I'll be with you when we're done.

801
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,400
Xiaoyu

802
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,920
I think I'm so thoughtless.

803
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,520
How can I disturb your reading?

804
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,400
I'd better serve you.

805
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,160
Come on, Xiaoyu.

806
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,560
Quick, write it down.

807
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,640
Hurry up.

808
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,800
I'll read it to you

809
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,120
social unity.

810
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,280
Is the book that the coach wants us to read

811
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
here?

812
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,880
Of course.

813
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,840
It should be

814
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,320
here.

815
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,680
Right?

816
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,040
Yes.

817
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,400
Let's go over there

818
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,200
and sit down to read.

819
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:01,560
OK.

820
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,560
Isn't it normal for us

821
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,640
to read in the library together?

822
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,680
Why are we hiding?

823
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,360
I don't know.

824
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,480
It's like a guerrilla warfare.

825
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,040
Ma Nan is so strange.

826
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,080
Did he find us?

827
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,680
No.

828
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,080
He went to the library so late

829
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,400
which is not his style at all.

830
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,960
It's normal.

831
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,280
There is a bonus for winning the provincial competition.

832
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,240
Each month

833
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,440
he pays off his mortgage several thousand yuan.

834
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,320
Send me

835
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,360
your train number.

836
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,400
I'll buy the ticket

837
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,800
for the next train to get you home.

838
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,520
Fine.

839
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
We can't see each other

840
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,840
for a long time.

841
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:23,960
A Chinese tongue twister to learn pronunciation.

859
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,880
What is he doing?

860
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,240
Idiot.

861
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,040
You.

862
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,360
Ah.

863
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,600
What are you going?
