Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP07

2
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,520
Hello.

3
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
What does the debate

4
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,160
mean to you?

5
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
For me

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
it means clouds, mountains

7
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,480
and the other end of them.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,640
Come to join

9
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,520
debate team two of DUFE.

10
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Team two?

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,040
I thought I have the chance to join team one.

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Goodbye.

13
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,600
Hello.

14
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
Life is not only for the present

15
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,880
but also the debate and dreams.

16
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,600
Debate?

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,320
Aren't you from the Comic Association?

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,760
We can also talk about the comic first.

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,440
Long distance separates no bosom friends.

20
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
Stop.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,600
If you take elective courses for me

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
I'll join you.

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,360
But I'm a teacher.

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,320
Bye.

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,080
Why are you sitting here?

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
There's nobody here, is there?

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll accompany you here.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
I've got a piece of grapevine.

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,720
What stocks?

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,320
Pack it in.

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
I have asked the director.

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,240
He said when Ma Nan was a freshman,

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,640
he was the

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
wonderful fourth debater of law school.

35
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,600
He never lost.

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,240
But everyone does not know why that

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
in the second semester

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,240
of his freshman year,

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,360
he seldom went there.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,040
He completely quit by his second year.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,800
It's said that he didn't come back

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,840
even the school called on him repeatedly at that time.

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,240
Is he so famous?

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,680
How come no one knows him?

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,720
That's normal.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,040
When Hao was a freshman

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,480
Ma Nan was in his junior year.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,320
No his legend already.

49
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,280
Hurry up, hurry up.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,040
Invite him to join us

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,800
as a fourth debater.

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,840
So we can defeat

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,400
team one.

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,080
Don't you hear it?

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,720
He was the fourth debater who never lost.

56
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,520
How can Nan Bei persuade him?

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,280
Hey, hey, hey.

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
You can say I'm not good at debating.

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
But you can't say

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm not good at fooling.

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,840
You, a man who likes taking shortcuts

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
have no idea what to do next

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,360
when you meet a hard man like him, right?

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,240
I shall take full charge of the matter.

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
What are you doing?

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,960
Ma Nan says meditation is

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,600
the latest method to keep healthy.

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,720
It can find a cure

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
and change the structure of the brain.

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,840
Then I can

71
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,760
understand art.

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,280
Then I can keep up with

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,360
what Jingwen says.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
You may not pass

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,960
the nine-year compulsory education

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,000
according to your current situation

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,440
not to mention CET-4.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,240
Do you know that?

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,960
Here you are.

80
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,800
Oh!

81
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,280
You are really something.

82
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
At the very most

83
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
it is worth 200 yuan in normal times.

84
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,240
I must try my best

85
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
since I work for you.

86
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,280
You can regard these

87
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
as the presents.

88
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,280
What do you want me to do?

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,280
Well.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,880
Let me be straight with u.

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,880
At present

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,640
Our debate team

93
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,280
is suffering now.

94
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to invite you to return to join us

95
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
as the fourth debater.

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,360
Ma Nan, you have ever debated?

97
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,480
Look.

98
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,080
Ma is like

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
a deep ocean of secrets.

100
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,000
You wouldn't understand.

101
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,080
You are really something.

102
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,160
Well done in espionage.

103
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,920
But I'm not interested in it.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Why?

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm in my fifth year of DUFE.

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,920
Graduation is a problem for me.

107
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,000
What does debate for?

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, Ma Nan.

109
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,920
Enter for CET-4

110
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
right now.

111
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,720
Li came again today.

112
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,160
Yes, yes, yes.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,920
Well, enter for CET-4 first.

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Solve the matter of extreme urgency first.

115
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,080
We'll talk about

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,000
the debate later, OK?

117
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,600
I won't enter for the exam.

118
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,800
No way.

119
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,120
It's hard to find a job

120
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
without a diploma.

121
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,120
No way.

122
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
If you don't find a job

123
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,840
you won't afford to buy a house.

124
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,080
No way.

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,000
You won't marry if you don't have your own house.

126
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,520
Will you have it all after graduation?

127
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,480
In my opinion

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
you're too naive.

129
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
Let me just give you an example.

130
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,920
What will happen after graduation?

131
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
Earn a few thousand of yuan a month.

132
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,440
Not enough for your expense.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,760
You have to ask your parents for money.

134
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,920
And you will face

135
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
the expectations

136
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,600
from everywhere.

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,320
It's worse

138
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,360
than it is now.

139
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
You don't know it till you try it.

140
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,400
With my understanding of

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
your ability of fooling,

142
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,760
I think you must be able to

143
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,560
make a difference

144
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
in the workplace.

145
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,120
Yes.

146
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,480
You don't know it till you try it.

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,000
You'll try it sooner or later.

148
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,800
What's the hurry?

149
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
I can stay until my seventh year.

150
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,000
In my seventh year

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,400
I can graduate as long as I want to.

152
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,440
You just seize the day to enjoy

153
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,960
the scenery around you

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
and chase after the girls around you.

155
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
Do you three have girlfriends?

156
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,400
Not

157
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,360
yet.

158
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,760
Look.

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,720
What are you thinking about?

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,760
Sleep.

161
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,400
Can I ask for

162
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,520
a refund of the fee for CET-4?

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
I am worthless.

164
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,080
Why do you get me here

165
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,680
since there is only you

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
at this late hour?

167
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
You think too much.

168
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm here because these two books

169
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,720
cannot be taken out at all.

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I can't even get it during the day.

171
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
Don't make excuses.

172
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
Why me?

173
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,840
Nonsense.

174
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,760
Who else can I get except you?

175
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,760
You're barely

176
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,800
the only man on our team.

177
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
In case something happens,

178
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
you can protect me.

179
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,920
Don't worry.

180
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,760
I can definitely run faster than you

181
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,160
if something happens.

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
Think about yourself.

183
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,640
Have you figured out

184
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
how to persuade Ma Nan?

185
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,880
No entering for CET-4.

186
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,280
No joining us as the fourth debater.

187
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,640
He doesn't want to do anything

188
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know what he wants.

189
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,800
What did he get on CET-4?

190
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,120
Director Li said that

191
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,840
he never entered for CET-4.

192
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,120
Is he afraid of

193
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
failing the exam

194
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
and not getting his diploma?

195
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
So it leaves a psychological shadow?

196
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,040
He is afraid of graduating successfully

197
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,920
with passing CET-4

198
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,760
and getting his diploma.

199
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,640
Not really.

200
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,160
Granted, our school is good,

201
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
but there's no way he doesn't want to leave.

202
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
It is not a permanent solution.

203
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
We really have to

204
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,560
change the guy.

205
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,600
But this guy has too many problems.

206
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,200
I've no idea

207
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,960
where to begin.

208
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,000
Then find out

209
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
what happened to him first

210
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,360
and the reason why he degenerate like this.

211
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Then suit your methods to the situation.

212
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,520
You have a point.

213
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll try next time.

214
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,040
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

215
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,560
Hurry up.

216
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,840
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

217
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,440
What are you doing?

218
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,200
What's wrong with you?

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,200
You.

220
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,360
What did you do just now?

221
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,880
What are you doing?

222
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,560
Do you have a thing

223
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,080
for me?

224
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
What? I haven't touched you.

225
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,320
Do you have a thing for me?

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,880
Stop.

227
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,280
You are pointing at me.

228
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,000
Keep your hands off me.

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't pointing at me.

230
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,080
-What?  -What are you doing?

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,680
How dare you.

232
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
What are you doing, Qing?

233
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
Didn't you agree to watch TV series together?

234
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,200
Why are you studying here?

235
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm done.

236
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,840
What's wrong?

237
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,520
I'm afraid I can't pass CET-4.

238
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,560
CET-4 is easier than college entrance examination.

239
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,280
What are you frightened of?

240
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm serious.

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,000
I just finished a real test paper.

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,560
After a year of

243
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,720
college experience,

244
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,920
my English is

245
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,280
so poor.

246
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,360
Really?

247
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,120
How about you, Fanfan?

248
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,120
Have you finished any real test paper?

249
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,720
Yes.

250
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
Just scraped a pass.

251
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
Even you just scraped a pass,

252
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,680
not to mention me.

253
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,600
She finished the real test paper for CET-6.

254
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
Come on.

255
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,480
What a dagger in the heart!

256
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
How about not taking the exam this time?

257
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,640
I won't go.

258
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,680
Don't be so pessimistic.

259
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,720
There is always a way to pass the exam.

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,680
Ma Nan

261
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,440
Is there

262
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
any plan for CET-4 this time?

263
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,760
Comic Market.

264
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,320
What? Comic Market?

265
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,400
Do you have tickets?

266
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,720
Three. Go or not?

267
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
Stop being entangled with each other.

268
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,680
The reputation of our school

269
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,960
will be ruined by you two sooner or later.

270
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,280
Bah!

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,320
Can it be our turn

272
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
since you are here?

273
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,600
Then you can

274
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
review here.

275
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
I'll go out for a walk.

276
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,400
Tao Hao

277
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,800
What's up?

278
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,360
Ma Nan

279
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,840
Is this you?

280
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,800
Director Li said

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,040
you were a big shot of school

282
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,600
in your freshman year.

283
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,480
You were not only good at debating,

284
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
but you were also the president of the student union

285
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,000
and the house captain of three associations.

286
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,640
You also got the national scholarship.

287
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Everyone had high hopes for you.

288
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,560
But nobody knew the reason.

289
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,920
In the end of your freshman year

290
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,400
you gave them all up.

291
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,040
And you quit from the debate team.

292
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,720
You even deleted all the pictures

293
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
in your WeChat Moments.

294
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Then

295
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,560
you truanted frequently,

296
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,280
failed the exam

297
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
and stayed down.

298
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,200
What do you want to say?

299
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,800
Why did you suddenly

300
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,920
become so negative?

301
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,800
Am I negative?

302
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,080
I don't think so.

303
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,120
I just chose

304
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,240
a different way of

305
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,320
being than before.

306
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
You have no any other interests

307
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,720
except sleeping and playing games.

308
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
And you didn't make friends,

309
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,040
go to class,

310
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,360
or prepare well for the exam.

311
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
And you stayed down.

312
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,560
You may not get your diploma.

313
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,680
Is it

314
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,520
the way of being that you chose?

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,920
Any problems?

316
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,600
Don't you think

317
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,680
it's a waste of your life?

318
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,520
What's the meaning

319
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,400
of living like this?

320
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,480
Meaning?

321
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,080
What do you

322
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,680
think about the meaning?

323
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,160
Flowers and applause?

324
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,920
Come out in front?

325
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,560
Or find

326
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
a good job after graduation?

327
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,800
We will be in a suit

328
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
and get well paid.

329
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,360
Or feasting

330
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,000
and revelry?

331
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Don't you think

332
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,960
it's like being put on

333
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,040
a treadmill that

334
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
can never stop?

335
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,120
You can only run forward involuntarily,

336
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,880
mechanically,

337
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,240
and desperately.

338
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,280
When a person is raised

339
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,600
by bubbles,

340
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
in order to prevent it from bursting,

341
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,560
you have to run higher

342
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,120
again and again

343
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
and so on.

344
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,200
Do you think

345
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,560
it's the meaning of life?

346
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,560
I remember one summer vacation.

347
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,440
A friend of mine

348
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,040
died in a drowning accident while swimming.

349
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,760
He often goes to the lake.

350
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,040
No one

351
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,360
knows the lake better than him.

352
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,000
How absurd!

353
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,200
We are

354
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,880
so small and ignorant.

355
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,720
However, we're always of self-righteousness

356
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,000
standing on the commanding heights

357
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
and measuring each other's value

358
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,560
with our own standards

359
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,720
and calling it the meaning in the end.

360
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm tired of

361
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,920
coming again and again.

362
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,200
When you start to

363
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,280
pursue the meaning,

364
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,880
you've long

365
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
been trapped by it.

366
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
You've long been chained to

367
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,920
the treadmill that can never stop.

368
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
The only way to stop all this

369
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,760
is to stop pursuing meaning.

370
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,280
So

371
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,760
you.

372
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,440
So

373
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,520
I chose to get off

374
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,400
the treadmill.

375
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,640
Oh my god.

376
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,080
It's too early.

377
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,280
What can we do?

378
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,280
Team one has told us

379
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,800
about the classroom.

380
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,840
If you want to

381
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
use the classroom,

382
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,240
you can use it before eight in the morning,

383
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,760
in the lunch hour

384
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,800
from 12 to 13,

385
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,200
and after 12 p.m.

386
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,640
God. Why is it so dark?

387
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,760
You're here.

388
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,520
Ah!

389
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
Hao, why are you here?

390
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
What are you doing here?

391
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
I studied all the competitions before the league

392
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,880
according to the statistics of team one.

393
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,880
Finally, I found a

394
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,240
Qiuyi Cup Debate Competition.

395
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,480
Qiuyi Cup?

396
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,920
It sounds fake.

397
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,800
Yes.

398
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,080
It's not as good as the Coal Cup

399
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,680
we took part in last week.

400
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,560
But

401
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,600
the school of finance also attended the competition.

402
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Really?

403
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Who?

404
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,800
The top four of the provincial competition last year.

405
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,480
Top four?

406
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,440
How could they

407
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,760
take part in such a competition?

408
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,080
I don't know.

409
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,480
Perhaps it was the result of a moment's inattention.

410
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,880
But it's not important.

411
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,840
As long as we can defeat them...

412
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,200
We can become famous.

413
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,040
Then we won't have to

414
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
care about team one anymore.

415
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,440
But they are top four.

416
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
How can we defeat them?

417
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,920
I think it shouldn't be an issue

418
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,600
as long as we can

419
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,480
persuade Ma Nan.

420
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,200
That's all?

421
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,680
Yes, that's all.

422
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,520
So

423
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,680
no Hisashi Mitsui's great change

424
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,880
as you think.

425
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,320
No family accidents.

426
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,080
He

427
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,640
has developed a habit of degenerating.

428
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,160
It's terrible for a person

429
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,080
to be lazy.

430
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,800
Ma Nan said

431
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,480
he didn't think he was degenerate.

432
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,360
He just felt that compared with the previous life

433
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
of seizing every minute,

434
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,800
sleeping late and playing games

435
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,840
are more comfortable.

436
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,640
He always felt that he had a good foundation.

437
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
He could catch up with others

438
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,800
if he wanted.

439
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,720
He didn't expect that

440
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,000
in his senior year,

441
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,400
the classmates around him

442
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,440
were starting preparing

443
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,120
for their papers

444
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,240
and finding jobs

445
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,880
He had

446
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,040
developed a habit of being lazy.

447
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,800
He also had the idea

448
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,280
of trying to cheer up.

449
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,800
But

450
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
he was defeated by inertia immediately.

451
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,880
When he finally thought

452
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,200
he had ushered in the ultimate trial

453
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,320
of not being able to graduate，

454
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,480
guess what.

455
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,040
His graduation can be delayed.

456
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,760
Such a life

457
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,200
can continue.

458
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,320
Bingo!

459
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,840
Actually, it's normal.

460
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,520
He doesn't even care about graduation，

461
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,440
not to mention come here

462
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,240
to debate.

463
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,480
Don't bet on it.

464
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,600
After all, he had

465
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,320
a glimmer of hope for life.

466
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,480
Such a person is not too difficult to save.

467
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,760
After all

468
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,640
nobody wants to

469
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
born a good-for-nothing.

470
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,440
So if we can

471
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,240
help him

472
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
cheer him up and face the graduation，

473
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,280
then there is the possibility

474
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,640
that he can walk it back.

475
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
Then our problem

476
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
might be solved.

477
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,360
We're friends.

478
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,200
I'll have a try.

479
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,800
That's it. It's like our life.

480
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Still at the starting point.

481
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,800
How about this?

482
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,480
Gamble big.

483
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,120
If I win

484
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,240
you enter for CET-4.

485
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,600
If you win

486
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,840
take part in our debate team.

487
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,520
Lead us to a victory

488
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,480
as the fourth debater, OK?

489
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,960
No way.

490
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,160
There are only two options anyway.

491
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,680
Choose one.

492
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,320
I choose C.

493
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,920
I usually choose C for questions that I can't do.

494
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,160
What's wrong with you?

495
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,760
You have a typical

496
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,040
graduation phobia, you know?

497
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,480
You're so weak.

498
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,520
So annoying.

499
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
Are you particularly idle lately?

500
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,160
Do you have a girlfriend?

501
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,680
Can you defeat Liu Yanze in the debate?

502
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,640
Have you entered for CET-4?

503
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
We met by chance.

504
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Leave me alone.

505
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,320
What? I take you as a brother, but you...

506
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,280
We both sleep in the same room.

507
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,240
Why did you say we met by chance?

508
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,960
I'm not playing anymore, bye.

509
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,360
You win?

510
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,240
The points?

511
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,920
Six.

512
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,120
Boring.

513
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,120
Let's turn to

514
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,320
page 102 first.

515
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,600
Let's look at some problems

516
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,520
in an article we learned

517
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,240
last week.

518
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,840
Look at the first question.

519
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,680
The first question is

520
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,160
why does William say

521
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,280
that nationality

522
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,400
makes no difference for him?

523
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,760
Anybody knows?

524
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,160
Where is it?

525
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,920
Do you understand what she said?

526
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,680
Nonsense.

527
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,280
Let me tell you.

528
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,720
Hurry back to the dormitory to

529
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,040
review your CET-4 if you have time.

530
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,800
Why are you here every day

531
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,200
and auditing in my class?

532
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,800
Didn't he accompany you to class?

533
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,440
What else?

534
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm at odds with Ma Nan.

535
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,400
So I come out.

536
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,880
You didn't succeed?

537
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
The best debater is not unworthy of the title.

538
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,680
Listen.

539
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,840
He may not have no desire

540
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,720
to cheer up.

541
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,320
It's just that his current state

542
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
shows that he has no ability to change it.

543
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,360
If it doesn't matter by strategy,

544
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,680
then get tough.

545
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,080
Look at what he is

546
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,480
in normal times.

547
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,200
It's not impossible.

548
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,160
I'll have a try.

549
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,760
Does anyone know the answer?

550
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
The boy in yellow.

551
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,320
Yes, it's you.

552
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,320
I choose C.

553
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,160
Boy, it's an essay question.

554
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,480
I choose C.

555
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,560
I choose C for questions that I can't do.

556
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,320
Forget it. Sit down.

557
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,080
It's training time for team one now.

558
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm not here to be trained.

559
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,680
I come to talk to you.

560
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,440
These are

561
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
butter cookies made by myself.

562
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,040
I misunderstood

563
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,520
you and Qiu Lingyan before.

564
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
And I said many harsh words.

565
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,640
Don't mind please.

566
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,880
That's nothing.

567
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,520
I went too far before.

568
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,120
After all, no one will appear in front of me

569
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,840
singing and dancing

570
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,920
every day.

571
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,080
I quite understand.

572
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,720
Xiaoyu often says

573
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm a drama queen.

574
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,640
So after accepting my cookies

575
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,640
we're even.

576
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,000
Thank you, but no.

577
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,800
I don't eat snacks.

578
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,400
Are you still angry with me?

579
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,200
Put it on the table.

580
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,960
You're eating cookies?

581
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,720
You never eat sweet food

582
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,920
in my impression.

583
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,960
It might be theirs.

584
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,440
I was hungry.

585
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
So I tasted one.

586
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Who bought it?

587
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,840
It's delicious.

588
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,800
Really?

589
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,680
Just ordinary cookies.

590
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,760
Of course you don't understand

591
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
sweet food.

592
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,440
By the way,

593
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,360
have you got the opponent's information

594
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,080
for the next competition?

595
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,880
Of course.

596
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Didn't you go to help the girl for jumble sales?

597
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,880
Why are you here

598
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,040
playing with buttons?

599
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,560
For sale.

600
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
How much are these?

601
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,080
Wholesale price is 25 cents each.

602
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,000
Selling price is 50 yuan each.

603
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,440
Do you think

604
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,120
everyone went to college

605
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,000
by drawing lots?

606
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,400
You don't understand.

607
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,960
Have you ever watched Japanese dramas?

608
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,160
The second button

609
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,760
on the T-shirt

610
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,080
is closest to the heart.

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,840
If you send it to a girl,

612
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,120
it means you send

613
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,720
your heart to her.

614
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,760
Unexpectedly,

615
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,080
there is the girl who

616
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,520
pays 50 yuan for your heart.

617
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
Then she should have her brain checked.

618
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,680
You wouldn't believe me.

619
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,440
What are you thinking about?

620
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
I'm thinking

621
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,240
whether I should

622
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,400
enter for CET-4 for Ma Nan.

623
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,760
But I'm afraid he'll fall out over this.

624
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
What are you afraid of?

625
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,680
I think maybe Ma Nan

626
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,000
also wants to enter for it.

627
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,040
It is because

628
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,440
we advised too much,

629
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,280
so it aroused

630
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,920
his dissatisfaction.

631
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,760
If you think so,

632
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,600
you can enter for CET-4 for him.

633
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,600
I have to sell buttons.

634
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,120
I'm leaving.

635
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,760
What are you doing?

636
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,560
If I say

637
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm finding your

638
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
second button,

639
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,040
will you believe me?

640
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,160
I will.

641
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,280
50 yuan.

642
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Well.

643
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,760
I don't want to make up stories.

644
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,320
We'll talk about the fourth debater later.

645
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
But you must enter for CET-4.

646
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,800
As your friend

647
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,200
I can't see you

648
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,080
be so decadent.

649
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,280
If you go on like this,

650
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,880
your life will be over.

651
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Let me ask you a question.

652
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,160
Do I have the right

653
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,640
to be a good-for-nothing?

654
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,240
You're thinking about

655
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,360
competing with team one.

656
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,160
No problem.

657
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,080
That's fine with me.

658
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,920
But I tell you.

659
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,120
I have lived such a life.

660
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,680
And mine is

661
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,840
much better than yours.

662
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,800
Now I only want to

663
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,920
waste my time

664
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,520
here.

665
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,600
Why do you have so many different opinions?

666
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,000
I...

667
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,080
And

668
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,600
if you'll compete with team one

669
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:12,840
I'll tell you.

670
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,520
It's useless.

671
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,960
Throw an egg against a rock.

672
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,000
I advise you

673
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,040
to recognize the reality.

674
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,080
Don't make unnecessary struggle.

675
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,720
OK?

676
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,040
Ma Nan

677
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,040
Are you

678
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,680
angry with me?

679
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,520
It won't pay.

680
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,640
The topic for the next game

681
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,880
came out.

682
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,480
Should the young

683
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,400
jump out of the comfort zone?

684
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,760
This is an old topic.

685
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,280
Comfort zone.

686
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,520
This word is so popular these two years.

687
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,680
Comfort zone means a person

688
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,480
stays in

689
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,720
a familiar environment and come into contact

690
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,160
with familiar people and things for a long time.

691
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,120
Then he refuses to challenge anything new.

692
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,920
He lives a comfortable life.

693
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,600
Thus it forms

694
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,160
an invisible circle.

695
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,880
Not that complicated.

696
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,160
It's an environment

697
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,520
that makes you feel comfortable.

698
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,120
The key is that you can handle it.

699
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,280
However

700
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
the comfortable sensation of self-consolation

701
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,240
and the inertia

702
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,400
will make it easy to reject

703
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,720
many possibilities of change.

704
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,040
If you step out of the comfort zone,

705
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,880
then you will face

706
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,320
many challenges and choices.

707
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,520
You will flinch.

708
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,680
Naturally

709
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,400
you'll

710
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
return back to your comfort zone.

711
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,000
Refuse to step out and make progress.

712
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,160
It's a cosy nest.

713
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,320
So what?

714
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,920
Is there any problems with a cosy nest?

715
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,040
No problem.

716
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,960
But I don't think it's a commendatory term.

717
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,120
I agree.

718
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,240
If we stay alone in a cosy nest

719
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,840
all the way

720
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,600
Then self-challenge and development

721
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,720
will remain stagnant.

722
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,480
Then there are

723
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,720
more and more

724
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,680
difficulties and challenges we don't want to face.

725
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,800
The comfort zone

726
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,840
will become smaller and smaller.

727
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,600
Right?

728
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,280
On the flip side

729
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,720
if he jumps out of the comfort zone

730
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,160
he can be used to live in a discomfort environment

731
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,120
then it will make himself comfortable again.

732
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,200
Then the comfort zone

733
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,240
will become larger and larger.

734
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,800
It's a cycle.

735
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,920
Did you notice

736
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,000
there is someone like this?

737
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,280
Ma Nan

738
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,320
It can't be more typical.

739
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,240
He is now slowly

740
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,480
sinking into his comfort zone

741
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,560
step by step.

742
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,440
It's getting to be a habit with him.

743
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,160
And he keeps brainwashing

744
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,960
to make himself believe

745
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,720
that he is right.

746
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,800
It's just

747
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,840
the excuse.

748
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,800
to escape.

749
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,000
If we help him solve the problem

750
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,360
there is the possibility

751
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,080
that he can join us.

752
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,880
That makes sense.

753
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,840
Who's the right person to go?

754
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,920
I'll have a try.

755
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,080
For the sake that you

756
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,200
gave me a break in the auditorium last time

757
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,440
I'll give you the time before I a bowl of noodles.

758
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:07,960
Please.

759
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,760
Ma Nan

760
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,440
I'm coming to talk about

761
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,200
joining our debate team.

762
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,600
Sorry.

763
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,360
Hao

764
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
Hello, director Li. What's wrong?

765
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,400
Where did you put my papers yesterday?

766
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,280
Papers?

767
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,680
I put the papers on the second shelf

768
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,000
of the first bookcase.

769
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,560
OK, I see it.

770
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,480
That's good.

771
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000
If you have anything to do, please contact me.

772
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,880
OK. Thank you.

773
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,680
Ma Nan, actually there are many advantages

774
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,680
to join the debate team.

775
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,320
Sorry.

776
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,840
Hello, Weiwei. What's wrong?

777
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,040
Tao Hao

778
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,840
Why are you crying?

779
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,720
He...

780
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,680
Calm down.

781
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,880
Speak slowly.

782
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,120
He unfriended me.

783
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,560
Unfriend you? Why?

784
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,800
I logged off

785
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,320
his game account.

786
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,080
It is not an option.

787
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,400
You two have to communicate well.

788
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,520
Or...

789
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,160
I send a message to him

790
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,680
and ask him to friend you back, OK?

791
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,000
That's the only way.

792
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,320
Don't cry. Wait for my news.

793
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,720
Thank you.

794
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,440
OK.

795
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,480
Hello.

796
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,560
Hao

797
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,560
Do you remember

798
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,680
the teacher said we should hand in

799
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,880
PPT next week?

800
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,560
Yes.

801
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,160
It's about the case analysis

802
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,080
of oversea purchase.

803
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,680
There are too many reference books.

804
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,600
Do you have any?

805
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,560
Yes.

806
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,440
I looked it up in the library.

807
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,520
It is available in the library.

808
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,640
It's about ten o'clock anyway

809
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
when the union activity is over.

810
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,920
Then the library

811
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,440
almost has to close.

812
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,400
I'm going there later.

813
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll borrow it.

814
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,400
We will hand in PPT next Monday, right?

815
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,960
When I traveled with my roommate

816
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,600
it's you who bought the round-trip tickets, right?

817
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,000
For what time?

818
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,040
Leave the day after tomorrow and come back on Sunday night.

819
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,280
It seems that I will miss it.

820
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,680
Then I won't go to travel.

821
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
You can go to travel.

822
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,440
It's OK. I'll

823
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
finish your PPT.

824
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,600
Sorry to trouble you.

825
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,760
Love you.

826
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
You're welcome.

827
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,040
You've finished.

828
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,880
The market price of PPT

829
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,680
is 500 yuan each.

830
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,120
Remember to collect money

831
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,920
next time.

832
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,840
Sir, she pays for the bill.

833
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,240
Write an invoice for me.

834
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,680
What are you doing?

835
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,920
Are you at your period?

836
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,040
I've been thinking all day.

837
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,520
I want to give up

838
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,720
inviting Ma Nan to be the fourth debater.

839
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,360
You've gone over to the enemy so soon.

840
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,360
Think about it.

841
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,160
According to his opinion

842
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,880
even it's wrong

843
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,720
that he has become a good-for-nothing

844
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
pissed away his time

845
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,600
and achieved nothing

846
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,680
but

847
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
does he have the right

848
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,320
to be a good-for-nothing?

849
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,080
No.

850
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,160
Why?

851
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,920
No for nothing.

852
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,240
How much did our country spend on

853
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,920
training him from childhood?

854
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,400
How much energy did his parents spend on

855
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,240
him from childhood?

856
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,840
How much energy did his teachers spend on

857
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,080
teaching him from childhood?

858
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,720
Now he

859
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,680
makes an excuse for himself

860
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,360
to be a good-for-nothing.

861
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,520
Didn't he let them down?

862
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,920
What are you laughing at?

863
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,160
Am I not cruel enough?

864
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,640
Listen.

865
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,600
What does Ma Nan's

866
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,560
pessimistic theoretical system with no ambition

867
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,600
fear most?

868
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,120
He fears to meet

869
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,160
a stubborn female deity

870
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,000
with high moral standards

871
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,040
like you.

872
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,600
Well, the system.

873
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,400
I think you are qualified for it.

874
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,320
You can do it.

875
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,320
Well.

876
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,480
I will work hard

877
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,240
for our team.

878
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,520
Show them how good you are.

879
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,840
Ma Nan

880
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,640
Good morning.

881
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,960
You are here to

882
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,640
bring the breakfast to Nan Bei?

883
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:01,960
No.

884
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,040
I brought it to you on purpose

885
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,920
Me?

886
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,160
Thank you. Bye.

887
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,760
Ma Nan

888
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,600
Let's talk for a minute.

889
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,080
Are you also here to persuade me

890
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,520
to join the debate team?

891
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,480
Yes.

892
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
You come and go

893
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,720
alone every day.

894
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,760
So unsociable.

895
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,440
How lonely!

896
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,600
Come to our debate team

897
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,400
and experience the feeling

898
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
of having friends.

899
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,360
Why should I get on well with others?

900
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,840
Human beings are social animals.

901
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,800
But there can also be

902
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,080
a maverick individual.

903
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,800
There are all kinds of people

904
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,640
in this world.

905
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
Their purpose is to

906
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,760
obtain the right to live

907
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,920
and a better life.

908
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,280
Survival of the fittest.

909
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,320
There is no right or wrong,

910
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,840
light or dark.

911
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,880
Survival is good

912
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,080
and worthy of respect.

913
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,120
Everyone is

914
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,760
a part of

915
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,320
the world.

916
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,880
Such a world will be better.

917
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,200
Each of us lives here.

918
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,960
Strive for

919
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,920
our own goals.

920
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,120
Do you understand?

921
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,640
It's horrible.

922
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,120
I'm beginning to wonder

923
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,480
if I should join

924
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,520
the debate team.

925
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,360
Yes.

926
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,480
Every time I talk to him

927
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,000
I have an impulse

928
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,360
to lie down and do nothing.

929
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,160
The brainwashing ability of Ma Nan

930
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,800
is too strong.

931
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,040
Look at you now.

932
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,760
Is it that exaggerated?

933
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,880
It seems that

934
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,920
it's my turn

935
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,360
finally.

936
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,200
Dango

937
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,120
Decide and act before over thinking.

938
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,200
It is easy for Ma Nan to brainwash.

939
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,920
Don't worry.

940
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,360
I shall take full charge of the matter.

941
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,160
The flower tips move because the water moves.

942
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,200
The shadow in the water shakes because the flower shakes.

943
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
I don't know that they have no intention

944
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,280
or they go in both directions.

945
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Dango

946
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Are you OK?

947
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,920
Xiaoyu

948
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,240
What do you think?

949
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,400
In this vast universe,

950
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,720
we humans are

951
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,160
as small as gravel.

952
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,320
We're born

953
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
destined to end.

954
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,960
Living.

955
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,840
What's the meaning of living?

956
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,160
Dango

957
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,720
It can't be...

958
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,560
Xiaoyu

959
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,000
What do

960
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,680
we humans mean

961
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,840
in this world?

962
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,080
Does our will really exist?

963
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,440
Where is the end of the universe?

964
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
What is the mystery of the universe?

965
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,880
Who can tell me?

966
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,200
Dango

967
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,760
What did Ma Nan say to you?

968
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
It's all in your brain, right?

969
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,360
Throw it away.

970
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,320
Don't think about it.

971
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,960
Hush.

972
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,520
Xiaoyu

973
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,520
Look at the sunshine today.

974
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm going to catch a few rays.

975
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,120
Bye.

976
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,640
What should we do, Hao?

977
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Another one got stuck.

978
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,640
It's so horrible.

979
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,200
The brainwashing ability of Ma Nan

980
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,160
is too strong.

981
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,000
He's like a black hole.

982
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,000
Any light will be swallowed by him.

983
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,720
Those who are

984
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,840
a little less determined

985
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,800
will be brainwashed by him.

986
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,240
Every time I talk to him,

987
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,160
I'll be brought into his logic.

988
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Then he persuaded me

989
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,520
with his deep understanding

990
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,360
of the theory.

991
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,880
But we're all debaters.

992
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,440
As a debater

993
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,160
there is no way not to think about

994
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,480
the logic and reason in each other's words.

995
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,960
Once you reason with Ma Nan

996
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
then you'll be brought into

997
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,760
his thinking space.

998
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,960
Then you will

999
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,280
understand how he feels as well.

1000
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,560
He's so hard to deal with.

1001
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,400
We can't listen to

1002
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,280
what he said.

1003
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,200
Our brains should be

1004
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,000
as hard and stubborn as stones.

1005
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,120
We don't have enough brain capacity

1006
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,000
to answer him.

1007
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,600
Are you talking about fools?

1008
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,280
No.

1009
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,280
We can't be fools.

1010
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,360
We must be pure

1011
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,800
and simple.

1012
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Our will is as firm as the sun.

1013
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,920
Our hearts are as hot as a volcano.

1014
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,600
So that it won't be

1015
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,000
swallowed by Ma Nan.

1016
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,200
How could there be such a person?

1017
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,600
Hello.

1018
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,040
You guys run here, too.

1019
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,160
Oh.

1020
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
It's nice to be young.

1021
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,600
Don't be shy.

1022
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,840
Let's have a competition.

1023
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,880
I'm coming to chase you.
