Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP10

2
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,320
Senior,

3
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
you didn't know that

4
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,480
my boyfriend

5
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,360
used to bring me here

6
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,160
to shop in this street.

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,440
This hot pot restaurant,

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
we used to come here, too.

9
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,240
Every time, we sat

10
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,760
there.

11
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,360
White clothes,

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,320
long hair,

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,760
a girl.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Your boyfriend?

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,040
Look at you.

16
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
You can't even eat an ice cream

17
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,640
with me.

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,840
Look at him.

19
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,160
Hold it carefully.

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,080
If the cake is broken,

21
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,880
you will be beaten.

22
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,520
How's it going?

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,240
It's okay. Everything's fine.

24
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,720
Where did you get all these stuff?

25
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,600
I had a lot of balloons

26
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,920
left from my last confession to Liu Yanze.

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,280
Throw them away now!

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,360
How inauspicious!

29
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,400
Shut up!

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,960
Dango, how did you know

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
they finished early today?

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,880
I played a little trick.

33
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Silly

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
Qiu Lingyan and Ding Li

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,280
are in the Actuarial Science Club.

36
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,560
The president is my buddy

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,840
who gave them both some work.

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Nice!

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,960
But...

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,760
But we don't have the key.

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,360
What should we do?

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,200
Didn't I say I would nail it?

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,320
Great!

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,360
Although you are just a trainee teacher,

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,520
you are

46
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
still a teacher.

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
Why are you doing

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
such thieving things?

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,520
What thieving things?

50
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,800
Do I have this skill?

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,200
This key was made by the coach of team one,

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,080
Meng.

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,680
Why did he give you the key?

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,200
But

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,040
isn't team one

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,880
trying to win us?

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,320
We coaches

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,920
are superstructure.

59
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,200
You think we are like you

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
little kids

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,440
who quarrel every day.

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Little kids.

63
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,440
-Go. Let's start!  -Start!

64
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Nan Bei, you take these things.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
Cake, cake.

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,360
You all let me take them by myself!

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Well,

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
I saw you in the mirror

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,000
at the hot pot restaurant.

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,480
Then explain.

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,120
For what?

72
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,280
She is

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,200
one of the new workers in our department

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,080
who are grateful for my

75
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,920
help in her daily work.

76
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,480
Then

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,280
she invited me to dinner.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
Are you angry?

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
What's wrong about that?

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,800
I have things to do.

81
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,560
I'll go first.

82
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,880
Is this a big deal?

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Just a dinner.

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
There's really nothing else.

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
I haven't asked you yet.

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
Who's that guy next to you?

87
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,040
A teammate in Debate Club.

88
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
That's it.

89
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,480
Well

90
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,040
You can go shopping with your teammate,

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
but I can't have a dinner with my colleague.

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,440
Besides that,

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
our problem

94
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,960
is not only my fault.

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,440
Are you having an affair with her?

96
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,920
You know it best.

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
How does it become my problem?

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
Doesn't it?

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,480
Tao Hao

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,400
What you do every day is facing the phone

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
and sending messages all the time.

102
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,000
I was thinking

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,080
how can a student

104
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
be so busy?

105
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,200
You always

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,680
try to please everyone around you.

107
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,080
Then I'll ask you, Tao Hao,

108
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,760
what about me?

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
That's the right name for you.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Do you remember

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
I am your boyfriend?

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
On your list every day,

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,320
don't I have

114
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
a priority?

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
Between how you deal with me now

116
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,640
and how you deal with those people in your department,

117
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,600
is there any difference?

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
When the problem between us

119
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,800
started?

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,960
Don't you know that?

121
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,720
Do you know

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,880
how tiring and boring it is for me to be your boyfriend?

123
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,200
Anyway, I came to you today

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,320
to explain this thing to you.

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,080
I think my sincerity

126
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,920
is enough.

127
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,560
If you are still misunderstanding me,

128
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440
I really have nothing to say.

129
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,640
I'll go.

130
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,160
Tao Hao, Nan Bei and Liu Yanze

131
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
are fighting in the training room!

132
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Get over here!

133
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,640
Sister Tao Hao

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Wish you to be more and more attractive!

135
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,880
Hope Hao

136
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
to lead us to an early victory

137
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,000
and get the champion!

138
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Good luck with Hao's

139
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,600
relationship and education!

140
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,560
Wish dear Hao

141
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,480
in the new year

142
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,840
to be happy

143
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,160
and joyful every day!

144
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,080
But today is not my birthday!

145
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,040
We know.

146
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Tomorrow is your birthday.

147
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,040
But tomorrow we

148
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,960
need to give your time

149
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,480
to you and your boyfriend.

150
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,400
That's why today we

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,560
are celebrating your birthday.

152
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,160
What's wrong with you, Hao?

153
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,520
You called me in such a hurry.

154
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,680
What's the matter?

155
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,640
Break up!

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,080
As to this kind of scum,

157
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
why not break up, or stay him for the New Year?

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Am I right, Xiaoyu?

159
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,360
Exactly.

160
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
Having ruffled her hair!

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Doesn't ruffling hair mean an affair?

162
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,320
What the hell?

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,720
What is the relationship between them?

164
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,160
I have such a good relation with Nan Bei,

165
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,560
but when did you

166
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
see he ruffle my hair?

167
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Right, you just pulled my hair.

168
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,800
We're not the same.

169
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,920
Hao

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't jump to conclusion.

171
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,960
What if that woman

172
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,720
has Parkinson's?

173
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,120
Right, I think

174
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,880
he has taken the initiative to tell you

175
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,080
instead of hiding,

176
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,760
maybe

177
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,600
there is really nothing wrong with them.

178
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,960
Just ruffling her hair?

179
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,080
What do you mean just ruffling her hair?

180
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,720
You talk like you are scum.

181
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,680
I am scum.

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,040
This really can not continue.

183
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,080
See?

184
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
Look at Ma Nan.

185
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,080
Although he is careless and casual at ordinary times,

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,160
on this kind of

187
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,040
principle issues,

188
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
he is still very reliable.

189
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,880
This cake really can't

190
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,960
go on like this,

191
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
it will be sour.

192
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm so sorry.

193
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,200
Everyone is

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,480
so happy for my birthday,

195
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
but I'm ruining it.

196
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,080
I'll cut the cake for all of you.

197
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,120
So nice!

198
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,320
It's a fruit cake.

199
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,200
Do you like it?

200
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
It was made by me and Nan Bei.

201
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,560
Hao

202
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,640
It's okay to eat the cake later.

203
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,480
But you need to know

204
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
you're the only one we're supporting.

205
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,480
Right.

206
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,040
We are your

207
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,680
strongest backing.

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,160
Ok!

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,400
Then I'll go back to my dorm later

210
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,120
and send him a message

211
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,120
to apologize.

212
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,840
Hao

213
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,880
Well, we're not so

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,600
supportive of you.

215
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
I thought about it on the way over here

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,960
and I thought I had put

217
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,760
a lot of pressure on him.

218
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,640
Being in a relationship with

219
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,560
someone like me

220
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,800
must be exhausting.

221
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,640
Hao

222
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,880
You can't think of yourself that way.

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,920
Hao

224
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,080
You don't have to think about him right now

225
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,920
and don't think

226
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,600
what advice we are giving.

227
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
All you need to think about right now

228
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,320
is what you really want

229
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,920
I just want to

230
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
make everyone around me happy.

231
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
That's the problem.

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,080
So what are we going to do now?

233
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,360
How about

234
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,240
going out?

235
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,760
Xiaoyu

236
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,360
Where's Hao?

237
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,600
Hao went back to her dorm

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
and said she wanted to be alone.

239
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
I really can't stand Hao

240
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,680
being bullied like that.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,960
That's a family matter.

242
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
How do we solve it?

243
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,520
Go have a showdown with that guy.

244
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
If he is truly a good man,

245
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,840
we can keep him for now and see what happens.

246
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,080
If he is really a scum,

247
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,240
let him disappear.

248
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,920
Exactly!

249
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,680
Well...

250
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,720
Are you a bit

251
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,520
out of bounds?

252
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,560
Hey

253
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,320
At the moment of your confession to Liu Yanze,

254
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,040
did you think I was meddling?

255
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,920
Not at all.

256
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,720
I was hoping you'd help me more.

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,520
See?

258
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,520
Good friends

259
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,040
need to cross the line.

260
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,680
Right.

261
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,520
What do you think?

262
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
I think Xiaoyu is right.

263
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,200
What?

264
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,680
Tao Hao's problem

265
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,640
is extremely serious.

266
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,480
As her friends,

267
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
we surly need to help her.

268
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,000
But the problem is with her.

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,600
We only need to

270
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,520
treat her.

271
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,280
The problem is that we failed.

272
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,120
Counting on you guys

273
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,520
is not as reliable as counting on me.

274
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm thirsty. I want to drink milk tea.

275
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,040
Will you say?

276
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,880
Tell her.

277
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,760
Tao Hao's problem

278
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,680
has two aspects.

279
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
The first aspect

280
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,800
is

281
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,520
her pleasing personality.

282
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,160
She always

283
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,440
meets the needs of everyone around her.

284
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,600
She doesn't say no to people.

285
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,160
And this kind of mindset

286
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
will become

287
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
the appearance of pleasing others,

288
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,960
which means she must meet

289
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,040
everyone's requirements.

290
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,840
But in this way

291
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
she will be very tired.

292
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,200
The second aspect

293
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,640
is that she goes against human nature.

294
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,360
What do you mean?

295
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,160
Man is an animal that seeks profit and avoids harm.

296
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,120
But now, she

297
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,040
puts the needs of others

298
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,320
above her own ones.

299
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Why?

300
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Why?

301
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,880
Why?

302
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,680
Why?

303
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,240
You are all students in the national key university.

304
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,080
You don't even know this.

305
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,240
Moreover, you are a teacher.

306
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,320
Because in her mind,

307
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,360
pleasing others

308
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,960
means acquiring

309
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,880
recognition from others.

310
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
The recognition of others

311
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,120
will lead to a

312
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,800
very good social relationship.

313
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,480
Once she doesn’t satisfy others,

314
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,280
this social relationship

315
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,480
will be very dangerous.

316
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
She will be nervous

317
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,280
until she pleases others,

318
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
or thinks

319
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,480
she pleases others.

320
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,280
But this

321
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,920
is often a thankless effort.

322
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,960
Why don't you

323
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,320
want to graduate?

324
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
With your eloquence,

325
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
even you don't want to be a psychologist,

326
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,840
you can still be a master

327
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,040
to swindle money.

328
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,520
Don't interrupt!

329
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,200
To conclude,

330
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,000
fundamentally

331
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,720
she is socially insecure.

332
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,760
Her sister

333
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,640
and experience without friends

334
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,520
in middle school period

335
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,600
both can cause a sense of insecurity.

336
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
That's why she tries to

337
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,320
maintain social relationships in this way,

338
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,440
and she's afraid to say no.

339
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,800
So what can we do?

340
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,080
Easy.

341
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
If she has a disease, treat it.

342
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,440
Senior,

343
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,400
you usually look like a misanthrope.

344
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,080
When it comes to Tao Hao,

345
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,280
why are you so positive?

346
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,120
Recently, I've been studying

347
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,160
how people go from mental illness

348
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,560
to psychopathy.

349
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,080
She is my observation target.

350
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,560
Then master,

351
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,120
how to treat the disease?

352
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,960
Easy.

353
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
Just give her a sense of security.

354
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
Then how to give her that?

355
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
What did you say?

356
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,200
We are her sense of security.

357
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,680
Actually I think

358
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,600
Tao Hao already knows.

359
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,200
She just doesn't realize yet that

360
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,280
she has had

361
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,080
this sense of security.

362
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,080
When she does,

363
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
the next thing she needs to do is

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,080
change the pleasing personality

365
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
she's been developing for so long.

366
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
So how to take action?

367
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,640
Just like before.

368
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,840
Let her say no.

369
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,560
But we have failed.

370
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,600
That's because

371
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,840
I didn't take action.

372
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,360
In fact,

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,640
he has good intentions.

374
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,240
But when he does something like this,

375
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,360
it always makes me feel a little...

376
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,880
Showing off.

377
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,120
Pretty good.

378
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,520
It's cool.

379
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,320
A man has to be a man.

380
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,240
What do you think?

381
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,000
Declare your opinions.

382
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,120
Agree or disagree?

383
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,160
Are we pushing her too hard?

384
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,720
I think it's reasonable.

385
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,840
Right. Hao.

386
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,640
Have a try.

387
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,960
Listen,

388
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
you can do the work of the student union,

389
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,960
but don't do anything unrelated to it.

390
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
After 9 p.m.,

391
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,840
don't answer the phone.

392
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,360
It can't be called reporting work.

393
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,240
It is harassing.

394
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,800
It's ok to help the teacher,

395
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,360
but let them buy their own coffee.

396
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,040
At this age,

397
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,960
if they don't move,

398
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
their joints will rust.

399
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,240
It is same to

400
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,920
the members of the student union.

401
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,360
You can teach them but can't do for them.

402
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,040
You'll have the baby

403
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,400
yourself.

404
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,400
You don't have to take care of other babies.

405
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,400
Agree or not?

406
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,720
How about

407
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
making a concrete analysis of a concrete problem?

408
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,800
Well,

409
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,240
I think don't be so absolute.

410
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,040
In case of a special emergency,

411
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,360
I'll take care of it.

412
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Well,

413
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
I know.

414
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,880
I don't agree

415
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
with anything.

416
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
Well,

417
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,440
very good.

418
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:18,960
Go on.

419
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
I know you all did it for me,

420
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
fearing that I am tired.

421
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,320
But I always felt like

422
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,520
this proposal

423
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,120
is not the solution.

424
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,680
So you turned down

425
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,600
our proposal,

426
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,040
right?

427
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,920
Not really.

428
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,480
How about taking the long view?

429
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,880
Nice.

430
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,640
No. Ma Nan, what do you mean?

431
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,080
Take your time.

432
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,160
You see.

433
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,920
You are saying no

434
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,840
to our proposal.

435
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,400
You

436
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
have to recognize that

437
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,880
conflict is inevitable.

438
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,400
You can't always

439
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,960
control everything,

440
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,560
right?

441
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,000
Hao

442
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,400
We thought

443
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,400
you were just helpful,

444
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,600
like an octopus, always giving others a hand.

445
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,840
But now we know

446
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
you also get tired and break down.

447
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,600
We are a family.

448
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,920
We're not giving up on you!

449
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,760
Right!

450
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,960
I know.

451
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,680
Ok.

452
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,840
Now let's go to step two.

453
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,400
Please.

454
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,040
OK.

455
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,120
Well

456
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,520
The next period,

457
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,280
we mainly train

458
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
thinking shielding.

459
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,000
In a nutshell,

460
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,120
when you are unable

461
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,880
to quickly understand

462
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,800
and refute the other party's points of view,

463
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,360
do not accept

464
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,800
or think about the other party's points of view,

465
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,240
so as not to be carried away,

466
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,040
and blurt out disagreement.

467
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,080
Do you agree?

468
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
Disagree!

469
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,800
Very good.

470
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,360
You see.

471
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,280
This is a one-on-one training session

472
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
for the debate team,

473
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,440
and it's also carefully designed for you.

474
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,600
Let's start to say no

475
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,400
from the small things,

476
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
just like in a debate.

477
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,080
How about that?

478
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,400
I...

479
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,720
I am the opposing side.

480
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,920
My fellow debater,

481
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,800
I disagree.

482
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,400
Inexplicably good.

483
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,800
Right.

484
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Gosh...

485
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,240
Hui, not done yet?

486
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,080
Yes.

487
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,960
This excel is too difficult.

488
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
I may not be in time.

489
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,320
Do you have something to do later?

490
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,080
I have a date with my boyfriend.

491
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Maybe it's too late today.

492
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,160
I will finish a midnight movie with him

493
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
and back to the bedroom about two o 'clock.

494
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,600
I don't need to sleep when I'm done this excel

495
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,640
and take class in the tomorrow morning.

496
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,480
How can you not sleep?

497
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,240
But Mr. Li has said that

498
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,600
it has to be finished today.

499
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
You can send it to me.

500
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,760
I have nothing to do right now.

501
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,440
Great!

502
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,280
Thank you, Hao.

503
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
Once upon a time, there was a farmer.

504
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,320
Before the storm came,

505
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,400
he did not build a warm shelter.

506
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,280
What to do?

507
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,840
He asked Mr. Wang next door for help.

508
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
They signed an agreement.

509
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,480
If the crops went bad,

510
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,640
Mr. Wang was to blame.

511
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,600
He

512
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,720
went back to have a baby with his wife.

513
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,440
As to this kind of crafty

514
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
and disgusting behavior,

515
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,240
Tao Hao,

516
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,640
if you were Mr. Wang, would you agree with that?

517
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,920
I disagree.

518
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Hao,

519
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,280
I won't bother you.

520
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,720
I'll do it myself.

521
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,440
Hui.

522
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,240
Hao, how's your body?

523
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,840
Mr. Li, much better.

524
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,920
Ma Nan

525
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,440
Put this file in order.

526
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
Later

527
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,600
Make the minutes of the meeting for me.

528
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,120
You can ask Hao about the format.

529
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,760
But, Mr. Li...

530
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
Mr. Li, I have things to do tonight!

531
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,840
Mr. Li!

532
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Well

533
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,440
Would you like to

534
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
help me with that?

535
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
I disagree.

536
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,840
What are you doing here?

537
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,800
Happy Birthday!

538
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,080
I booked

539
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,520
your favorite Japanese restaurant tonight.

540
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,440
After the dinner,

541
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,560
how about going to the movies?

542
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm a little busy today.

543
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,280
Maybe another time.

544
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,600
You know

545
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,360
it's hard to book at that Japanese restaurant.

546
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,200
Let's go.

547
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
Well, if you change your mind,

548
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,160
then text me,

549
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,040
ok?

550
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,920
I wish you good fortune and longevity.

551
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,440
Happy birthday to you.

552
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Your son

553
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,840
doesn't look like

554
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,720
other ducks.

555
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,480
You still

556
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,760
put a red scarf on it.

557
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,800
Are you going to isolate it?

558
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,880
I disagree.

559
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
This is what we call big frog in a small pond.

560
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,080
Not like your turtle,

561
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,960
crouching neck all the time,

562
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
like it's hiding from others.

563
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,720
I disagree.

564
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,040
We call this low-key.

565
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,840
Don't like you playboys.

566
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,200
I disagree.

567
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,320
Hao's boyfriend

568
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,960
is a playboy.

569
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,320
I am a potential stock.

570
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,560
I disagree.

571
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,520
Hao's boyfriend

572
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,120
is a scum.

573
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,400
I disagree.

574
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,840
Hao's boyfriend

575
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,720
was wrong.

576
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,520
But he still can

577
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
be forgiven.

578
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,360
Hao

579
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,320
has been angry for several days.

580
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,760
Just ignore him for some days.

581
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,840
I disagree.

582
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
You have to be single-minded in a relationship.

583
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Going out for dinner with others

584
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,360
must let me know.

585
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,480
I disagree.

586
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,640
If we

587
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,680
both have a boyfriend or girlfriend...

588
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,960
Take Dango as an example.

589
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,080
If Dango has a boyfriend,

590
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,120
can't she have a dinner with me?

591
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,840
It's just a relationship.

592
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,760
I am not finding

593
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,640
a mother who's in charge of everything,

594
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,360
or a leader

595
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,680
who needs to be reported with everything.

596
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,800
I say I disagree.

597
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,800
I also disagree

598
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,600
my idea.

599
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,040
But I agree with yours.

600
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,840
Do you agree with mine?

601
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
Hao is an almost perfect girl.

602
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,280
Her only shortcoming is too kind.

603
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,320
But you came up with a great idea.

604
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,440
Thanks to Ma Nan this time.

605
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,040
I just don't know if his folk remedy

606
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,080
will work.

607
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,160
Ma Nan,

608
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,920
that little weasel,

609
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,120
you need to keep an eye on him.

610
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,920
The boy has too many wicked ideas.

611
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm afraid that he will have some bad ideas one day.

612
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,520
Sa

613
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,240
The future of this team depends on you.

614
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,920
I disagree.

615
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
Sir, I, I'm sorry.

616
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
I, I didn't mean that.

617
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
I just trained like this these days.

618
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
The situation in the debate

619
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,920
change rapidly.

620
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,800
You are all here.

621
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
I just got the message.

622
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,400
The next semi-final debate's

623
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,320
topic is here.

624
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
Setting a person image is advantageous

625
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,360
or disadvantageous?

626
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
So from now on,

627
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,520
We need to start

628
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,480
getting ready for the game.

629
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,720
I disagree.

630
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,720
It can be agreed.

631
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,560
Training time for the team one

632
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,320
is almost here.

633
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
Please team two

634
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,160
and somebody

635
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,040
go out.

636
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,920
Go out.

637
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,240
I disagree.

638
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,680
As to this classroom,

639
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,800
we have half the use of it.

640
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,840
Although at ordinary times

641
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,520
We are more sensible

642
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,440
and put you first,

643
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
but in our time of need

644
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,360
we also have

645
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,160
the right to use this classroom.

646
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,800
Do you agree?

647
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,400
I disagree.

648
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,360
As an auxiliary team,

649
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,200
you should fully cooperate

650
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
with we team one.

651
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,920
I disagree.

652
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,880
We all joined the contest.

653
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,200
Training classroom should give priority to the contest.

654
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Whoever has the schedule has the final say.

655
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,280
Do you agree?

656
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,880
Disagree.

657
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,800
Routine training

658
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,240
is as important as the contest preparation.

659
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,520
I disagree.

660
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,000
I...

661
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
Can't you just let us use it?

662
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,640
Let's go.

663
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,800
What?

664
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,040
Really?

665
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,480
Let them use this time.

666
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,880
Dango, Dango.

667
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,720
What's the situation, Dango?

668
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,560
You are awesome!

669
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,320
Dango

670
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,480
You are great!

671
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,000
What happened?

672
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,920
Mr. Li

673
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
The lesson plans you asked me to make

674
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
has been sent over to you.

675
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,320
Please have a look.

676
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,920
Mr. Zhang

677
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,040
An alternative to your course selection

678
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,960
have been finished.

679
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,920
I just e-mailed it to you.

680
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,320
Please remember to check it.

681
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,880
Hui

682
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,360
Your report

683
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,080
has been done,

684
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,960
and I put it on your desk.

685
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,560
Remember to pick it up tomorrow.

686
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
Well, I...

687
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,440
I heard it all.

688
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,760
Let me explain.

689
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,000
There is a reason.

690
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,040
Today is Hui's boyfriend's birthday

691
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,240
which only happens once a year.

692
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,360
It's not good for her not to go.

693
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,680
I really rejected as much as I could.

694
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,080
Then we all worked

695
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,840
in vain before.

696
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,760
I, I didn't

697
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
mean to do anything.

698
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm not tired.

699
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,160
I'm happy, too

700
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,760
I...

701
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,120
I'm so heartbroken.

702
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,920
You let me down.

703
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,600
I'm sorry to let you down.

704
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,800
I can't control myself.

705
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,560
Come here.

706
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,320
I know.

707
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,440
I understand you.

708
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,320
Aren't you disappointed at me?

709
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,440
No one can change

710
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,720
in an instant.

711
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,480
Just like a smoker

712
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
can't quit smoking

713
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,800
at once.

714
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,120
Even if he quits,

715
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,160
he also needs a long process.

716
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm sure you'll be fine.

717
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,880
Really?

718
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,680
Really.

719
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,000
I trust you.

720
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,360
I hope you can also

721
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,040
trust yourself.

722
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,840
At present,

723
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
what you need most

724
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,360
is to have a good rest.

725
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,600
Come.

726
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,160
First,

727
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
close your eyes.

728
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
Follow me.

729
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,880
Inhale.

730
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,520
Yes.

731
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Exhale.

732
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,320
Inhale.

733
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,320
Exhale.

734
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,880
It will be just fine.

735
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,680
There should be applause.

736
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,240
Nan Bei, are you going to

737
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,000
show us a program of

738
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,280
Listening to Nan Bei's Story?

739
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
I don't want to criticize you,

740
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,000
but you

741
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,880
truly don't know how to think about yourselves.

742
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,480
Why did we

743
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,200
keep winning before?

744
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,360
The opponents we've met before

745
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,000
could be won with a little talk.

746
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
But the opponents we will meet this time

747
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,720
are on a par with us.

748
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,960
What should we focus on?

749
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,640
We should focus on the creativity.

750
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,480
As far as this video is concerned,

751
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,640
is it particularly

752
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,920
appropriate for our next game?

753
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,960
Yes.

754
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,920
But it's a debate contest,

755
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
not a short video contest.

756
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
In previous contests,

757
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,800
there are indeed individual precedents using a short video.

758
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,440
But Nan Bei,

759
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,400
is your video a little

760
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
like a stream of consciousness?

761
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,440
We also need time

762
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,320
to explain to the audience.

763
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,280
Indeed.

764
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,640
B...But, Nan Bei,

765
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,040
First of all, your video

766
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,800
is great.

767
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,480
But short videos

768
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,160
are only auxiliary.

769
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
After all, you can't expect

770
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,680
all audience

771
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,760
to fully

772
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,880
understand

773
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,320
the main idea of your video, right?

774
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,840
Right.

775
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,920
And it lacks artistry.

776
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,800
Do you know what artistry is?

777
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,840
Do you know?

778
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,560
Do you know?

779
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,040
I think that's a good idea.

780
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,920
It's a very good concept.

781
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,440
Recently, the film and television department of our school

782
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,520
is selecting scripts.

783
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,200
You, me and Dandan,

784
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,080
we three

785
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,320
refine the story

786
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
and then we can get a production fee.

787
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,520
And then maybe

788
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,720
the New Scriptwriters Award is ours.

789
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
That's why

790
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,840
you're the best debater.

791
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,640
However,

792
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,040
this kind of visual labeling presentation

793
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,440
is really able to

794
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,840
deepen the view.

795
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,760
But

796
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,920
should we

797
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,640
consider

798
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,960
how can we make

799
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,840
it fit the contest occasion?

800
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
What do you think, Nan Bei?

801
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,360
When we get the copyright...

802
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,760
When we get the copyright,

803
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,560
we can make a movie,

804
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
an online drama,

805
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,000
and then a TV play.

806
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,080
Then the play will spread all over the world.

807
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,840
Then

808
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,160
we can set the theme park and peripheral products.

809
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,800
This is an industrial chain.

810
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I'll let you play

811
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,360
the leading actress, will you?

812
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,680
When you get your Angel Investment,

813
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
I will think about it.

814
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,480
What about you?

815
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,960
I am the director, film producer,

816
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,720
scriptwriter and the leading actor.

817
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,720
Everybody,

818
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,600
you should know

819
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,200
why good movies

820
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,800
are fewer and fewer.

821
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,920
Oops!

822
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,480
I forgot to pick up the contest files.

823
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,560
I left them

824
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,640
on the desk in the classroom.

825
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,560
Mr. Li is expecting me to go to a meeting.

826
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Will any of you have time

827
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,840
to help me to get them?

828
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,840
I'll go.

829
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,120
You have to be at the meeting.

830
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,680
Damn it...

831
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,720
Hao, I really want to go,

832
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,760
but,

833
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,320
team one must be there by now,

834
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,960
and that person is there,

835
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,520
I...

836
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,520
Hao, I also want to go,

837
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,040
but that person is there

838
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,000
who I don't want to talk to.

839
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,080
I'll go.

840
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,840
I have time.

841
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,040
I have much time.

842
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,040
I am a free man.

843
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Your friend's

844
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,280
taste and thoughts are both

845
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,640
dangerous.

846
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,440
She has a sense of propriety.

847
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,160
Maybe...

848
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
These are the notes for our team.

849
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,960
You're prying into others' privacy.

850
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,000
It's wrong.

851
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,760
We were in the same varsity team.

852
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,560
What's wrong if I concerned about team two?

853
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
And I didn't see much of them.

854
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,120
Don't worry.

855
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,160
Alright then.

856
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,400
It's the topic from

857
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,480
the last year's provincial final contest.

858
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,520
How do you have time

859
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,320
to replay this contest?

860
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,600
They are our opponents in the next competition.

861
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,840
Know yourself as well as the enemy.

862
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,600
Do you have anything else to say?

863
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,200
The cookies that day

864
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,640
were delicious.

865
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,640
Right?

866
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
I told you they were delicious!

867
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,080
I'll make them for you if you like.

868
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,600
There’s no need.

869
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,840
I'll go to class.

870
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,800
Did you dig the potatoes?

871
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,600
You are so slow.

872
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
I have to wait in line.

873
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
If you think I'm slow, then go by yourself next time.

874
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,760
Do you know?

875
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,080
Your

876
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,880
person image in my mind is violence.

877
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,240
So the person image of all the people

878
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,840
is a kind of

879
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,520
impression in other people's minds.

880
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Am I right?

881
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,640
So if you think about it this way,

882
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,120
person image is the impression in other people’s minds,

883
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,480
then setting a person image is

884
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,120
a means of influencing others' impression.

885
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,160
But all the influence

886
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,320
is a kind of travesty.

887
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,280
So setting a person image

888
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,200
is a travesty to a certain extent,

889
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,720
right?

890
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,360
It's too farfetched.

891
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,360
If it goes back to the beginning,

892
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,400
I think

893
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,280
my impression of you is violence,

894
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,640
so is your person image violence?

895
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,920
Of course not.

896
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,680
Therefore,

897
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
the attribute of the person image

898
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,960
has some subjectivity.

899
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,040
The person image starts with me,

900
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,840
right?

901
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,720
But this is the opponent's point.

902
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,920
I disagree,

903
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,600
but I think

904
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,480
that makes sense.

905
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,760
What are you doing?

906
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,960
I haven't been so tired lately.

907
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,240
In these days,

908
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,120
I turned down at least three people.

909
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,280
Ok.

910
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,600
I'm a lot more relaxed now.

911
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,120
What's this?

912
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,080
Mr. Wang asked me to do this.

913
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,240
It's the investigation

914
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,360
about the social practice.

915
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,600
I offered to help.

916
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,840
Because Mr. Wang said

917
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,200
it was worth credits.

918
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,120
Good for me.

919
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,000
You've got more credits

920
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,280
than I've

921
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,360
ever retaken.

922
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,080
Forget it.

923
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,680
Don't care about these.

924
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,760
Oops!

925
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,040
No! No!

926
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,560
You give me

927
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,240
the office key!

928
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm going to the office.

929
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,720
What's wrong?

930
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,240
Gosh

931
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,320
I forgot

932
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,040
the task Mr. Li gave me.

933
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,480
But this night

934
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,240
I have to have a dinner with Dandan.

935
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,360
I can't go.

936
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,560
I have to stay up late to finish the work.

937
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,600
I'll help you.

938
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,000
After all I wrote it.

939
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,680
Really?

940
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,560
Tao Hao, you are so kind.

941
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,760
How can I live without you!

942
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,520
Don't be so dramatic.

943
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,120
It's okay. I'll do it.

944
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,000
What's wrong?

945
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,960
What do you say?

946
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,400
You played a trick on me!

947
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,440
Yes, I am playing a trick on you.

948
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
You can't cheat!

949
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,240
But you still believed me.

950
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,480
Oops!

951
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,880
Oops!

952
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:15,920
Look!

953
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,360
It's weak!

954
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,640
It's broken!

955
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,080
What kind of hand is that?

956
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,600
Really, it can't move!

957
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,800
Let's start with the definition of the person image.

958
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,840
What's the attribute

959
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
of setting a person image?

960
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,640
I think it can be discussed in terms of subjectivity

961
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,240
and others'

962
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,440
empowerment.

963
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,840
These are the two aspects.

964
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,320
One additional point.

965
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,480
The development of the person image.

966
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,000
Right.

967
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,240
Mr. Li

968
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,920
Mr. Li

969
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,240
Mr. Sa

970
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,320
Come here.

971
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,120
I need to talk to you about something.

972
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,440
Ok.

973
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,360
You go on.

974
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,160
So on social media

975
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,080
or in front of your friends,

976
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,560
setting a person image

977
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,200
essentially means

978
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,080
managing your image

979
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,360
in front of others.

980
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,120
But if

981
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,880
that is the case,

982
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,040
the person image is actually

983
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,840
determined by others,

984
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,560
not by ourselves.

985
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
But if you leave your fate

986
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,640
in the hands of someone else,

987
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,480
it doesn't usually end well.

988
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,600
No!

989
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,480
Mr. Li

990
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,080
In this way,

991
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
it's so disrespectful to the students!

992
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
What are they talking about?

993
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,840
Listen.

994
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,360
This game

995
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
is also important

996
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,920
to team two!

997
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,240
Have a look.

998
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,560
In this month,

999
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,680
we really won a lot of games.

1000
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,520
You need to trust us!

1001
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,440
We can win

1002
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
this contest!

1003
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,800
What's going on?

1004
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,760
What's going on?

1005
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,240
Let me say something.

1006
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,080
Since Mr. Sa does not say,

1007
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,200
I'll tell you.

1008
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,800
For the next game against Fulin,

1009
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,880
we decided that the team one would go first.

1010
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,840
You prepare for other games.

1011
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,280
Why?

1012
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,280
Against last year's provincial runner-up,

1013
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,360
we think the team one will be more safe.

1014
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
You team two are great, too.

1015
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,880
We didn't mean anything else.

1016
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,880
We have signed up

1017
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,720
through formal channels.

1018
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,600
How can you change us freely?

1019
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,240
Sir, what's wrong with us?

1020
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
You are not suitable anywhere.

1021
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,280
In the two years you've been in the varsity team,

1022
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,680
our university hasn't even made it

1023
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,920
to the provincial finals.

1024
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,640
Indeed.

1025
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,560
Who do you look down upon here?

1026
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,240
Since it's in the name of

1027
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,680
our university,

1028
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,720
what's the problem

1029
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,400
with our participation?

1030
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,680
We just don't want to

1031
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,560
embarrass the university.

1032
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,800
Who will embarrass the university?

1033
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,160
You embarrass the university.

1034
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,800
Personal attacks without ability?

1035
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,200
Don't forget you team two...

1036
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,920
Team two!

1037
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,800
Team two!

1038
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,200
Without our points,

1039
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,160
how can you join the contest?

1040
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,000
But we are

1041
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,840
fighting for the honor of the university.

1042
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,960
Who is not?

1043
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,280
Right!

1044
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Your efforts are efforts!

1045
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,120
Our efforts mean nothing!

1046
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,360
Stop! Stop!

1047
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,000
When we were accumulating points,

1048
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,960
what were you doing?

1049
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What were you doing?

1050
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,840
Disgusting!

1051
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,080
When we were accumulating points,

1052
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,040
what were you doing?

1053
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,920
I disagree!

1054
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,960
I disagree!

1055
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
I disagree!

1056
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,600
From now on,

1057
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,080
the points for fighting against the provincial team,

1058
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,160
team one should accumulate by themselves.

1059
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,680
I quit team two.

1060
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,040
Tao Hao, wait!

1061
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,840
Sir, I have made up my mind.

1062
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,440
Guys,

1063
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,160
if you like,

1064
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,360
leave with me.
