Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP01

2
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,720
Nanbei, stop!

3
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,440
Stop there!

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Nanbei!

5
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,280
Bei...

6
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,320
You!

7
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,040
No more running?

8
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,760
Play something for us?

10
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,080
Last semester,

11
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
we participated in

12
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,040
fifteen competitions outside the school.

13
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,000
We won four of them

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,360
and lost eleven.

15
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,080
There's one thing I'm certain of.

16
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,080
I've become the best debater

17
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,360
in these four competitions

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,000
because of my talents and skills.

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,360
Why don't we talk about

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,080
the other eleven competitions

21
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,040
which we lost?

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,920
It's just bad luck.

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
Bad luck?

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,680
Do you really think that it's bad luck?

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,560
How dare you say that.

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,400
If it wasn't because of you

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,640
making fun of their lecturer's baldness,

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,600
we shouldn't have lost that many times.

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,720
Did I?

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
It's just like how wearing a wig or not

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
is a personal preference.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
Isn't that right, sir?

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,120
We can't say that certain changes are good

34
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,080
just because something happened

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,200
that resulted in fewer annoyances.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,680
For example, our judge,

37
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
he doesn't need to wash his hair anymore.

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,480
You can ask him if it's good or not.

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,880
If I do it again,

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
please pinch my thigh.

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,080
In last week's competition,

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
I've already pinched the heck out of it.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Did it stop you?

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm telling you that you must practice.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,080
Stop fooling around with those petty tricks.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,320
Petty tricks?

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Are you saying that I'm using petty tricks?

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
For us,

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
what do you think we need most right now?

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
We need more new blood.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
We need publicity.

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,880
I've heard

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
our school is currently disbanding

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
clubs which don't have enough members.

55
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,840
Are you saying

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
that our club might get disbanded?

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,320
Nonsense.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
According to what you said earlier

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,080
about our club's performance in last year,

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,200
we're in real danger.

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,880
No way will we get disbanded.

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
Where did you get

63
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,120
your confidence from?

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,520
There are three reasons why I am sure.

65
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,480
First

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,080
Little Xiaoyu, our lucky mascot

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,880
who has accompanied me

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,280
since my first year in university.

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,200
As long as we have it in our debate club,

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
nothing bad

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,560
will ever happen to us.

72
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,880
Ah, right.

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I wasn't at home during the weekend,

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,600
so I've entrusted it to you.

75
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,520
Is it still alright?

76
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,640
Is this alright?

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,680
I've only ever seen people walk their dogs.

78
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,920
This is the first time I see someone walk a tortoise.

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,000
No problem.

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,200
Look how happy it is.

81
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,240
Hurry up! We are waiting for you two!

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,840
Coming!

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,200
It's currently resting

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
in a luxurious mansion,

85
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,280
well-ventilated,

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
in the shade

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
where sunlight is coming

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,720
in a 45-degree angle.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,520
That's good.

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,240
Second

91
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,680
What do you think our debate team is?

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,760
It's a club founded by our old coach

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
with decades of history.

94
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,480
It's like his flesh and bone.

95
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
I believe

96
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,720
that as long as our old coach is still breathing,

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
he will never allow

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,040
anything bad happen

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
to our debate team.

100
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,880
Nurse! He's not breathing!

101
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,200
Sa.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,480
I'm here.

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm here.

104
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,280
Coach, I'm here.

105
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,800
The debate team...

106
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,400
The debate team...

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,800
What's with the debate team?

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,520
Go to Tao Hao.

109
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,400
Third,

110
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
which is the most important point.

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,680
We have Tao Hao in our team.

112
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Good morning, sir.

113
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,400
Tao Hao.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,920
Send this to the administration office for me.

115
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,640
Alright.

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,720
Tao Hao.

117
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,600
We're going to the meeting.

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,000
Remember to send us the documents.

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,920
Alright.

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,600
Mr. Li.

121
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:37,800
Hey.

122
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,480
Hao, you're here.

123
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,760
Mr. Li.

124
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,720
Can you please take a look at this?

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
This is our club fund applications

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,840
for this semester.

127
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,720
Tao Hao.

128
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,840
This office

129
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,040
cannot operate without you.

130
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
The student council is very smart

131
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
for choosing you.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
These are my responsibilities.

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,480
With these guarantees, there is no way we'll get disbanded.

134
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,600
Hey!

135
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Where do you think you're going?

136
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
Didn't class end?

137
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,280
Yeah.

138
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,520
I heard the bell rang just now.

139
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
We're in the middle of class!

140
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,000
Go back to your seats!

141
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
We heard wrong. I'm sorry.

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,520
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,600
Meet me at the small garden after class.

144
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Be prepared.

145
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,920
Be prepared?

146
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,400
Why do we need to prepare?

147
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
It's about tomorrow.

148
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,920
Oh.

149
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,560
Dango has fallen in love with a handsome guy

150
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,480
and wants to confess, right?

151
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,080
Tell me the whole story.

152
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,520
What is this?

153
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,600
It's the whole story.

154
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,080
She can hear us from there?

155
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
Alas.

156
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,280
Why are you sighing?

157
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,640
Let her chase after her love interest freely.

158
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
You may not know this,

159
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
but when Dango fell in love

160
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,200
with a handsome guy in the past.

161
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
She fell in love at first sight and projected too far into the future.

162
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,560
She even prepared

163
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,160
their granddaughter's

164
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,880
cat's name.

165
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
One week later, she confessed

166
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,960
in front of the whole school.

167
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,600
Did she succeed?

168
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
Of course...

169
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,560
Not.

170
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,480
Don't worry.

171
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
That's the past.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,920
She has me now.

173
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,600
I'll make sure she will get him

174
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
in one go.

175
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,120
The reason why I'm here

176
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,280
is to talk to you about

177
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,640
the debate team.

178
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,240
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

179
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,280
In the next competition,

180
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
and the provincial competition after that,

181
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,200
I've already made thorough preparations.

182
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Well...

183
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,600
About the debate team.

184
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,000
After we have discussed in the school committee,

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,920
we've unanimously decided

186
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,240
that the team of Western University of Science and Technology

187
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,520
should represent us after the merger.

188
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,760
I don't think

189
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
you need to go to the competition next week.

190
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
There's no meaning of it.

191
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,000
But you can't just

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
disband our team like that, can you?

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,800
Our team is disbanded?

194
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
You can think of it that way.

195
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,720
Look at the team of Western University of Science and Technology,

196
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,200
they won the second prize in the national competition last year.

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,120
We all saw that.

198
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
This is good for the school.

199
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,120
Go back

200
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
and have a nice talk with them.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,120
Yes.

202
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
I understand.

203
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,120
Did you get the balloons?

204
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,040
Miss,

205
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,400
they don't sell balloons in the supermarket.

206
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,200
Which supermarket sells balloons?

207
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,600
You're yelling at me again.

208
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
Alright, I'm sorry.

209
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,680
I'll buy some for you right away, alright?

210
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,200
Yes.

211
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,640
Bye.

212
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,280
Bye.

213
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,560
So, why didn't you tell her?

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,880
I just saw him

215
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,360
in the Fenglinwan Hotel.

216
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
I didn't see any

217
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
crucial evidences.

218
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,680
Consider the name of this hotel.

219
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,400
How can this be proper?

220
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,320
Besides,

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,880
what else can a single man and woman

222
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,840
do in a hotel?

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,480
Practicing their scripts?

224
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,200
What if they're really practicing their scripts?

225
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,760
Then, I should say

226
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,960
they went to the hotel to play poker.

227
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,160
Even if it's true,

228
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,040
Dango might not believe me.

229
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,800
What should I do?

230
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,240
Why won't she believe you?

231
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
What if I tell you that the shoes that

232
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,040
cost more than one thousand yuan

233
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
are fake,

234
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,600
will you believe me?

235
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,200
Impossible!

236
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,400
That's not true.

237
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,360
How can that be?

238
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,120
You see?

239
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,320
People will only believe

240
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,560
what they choose to believe.

241
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,320
I think you girls

242
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,120
think too much.

243
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,960
You only need

244
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,240
to tell her directly, right?

245
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay.

246
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,400
Show me.

247
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,000
Show me how you will do it.

248
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Alas.

249
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,440
You tell her,

250
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,800
Dango.

251
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,400
Yes.

252
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,480
Your Prince Charming.

253
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,120
Yes.

254
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,320
With another person...

255
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,600
That...

256
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,520
What?

257
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
Um...

258
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,200
I think your concerns

259
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
are valid.

260
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,040
Are you going to tie, stick

261
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,840
or hang these two together?

262
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,960
Just hang them over there.

263
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,560
But I don't think green is good.

264
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440
I like pink.

265
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,200
Green is good.

266
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,280
Everyone is here.

267
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,240
That's good.

268
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,000
I need to tell you something.

269
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,800
It's about our old coach.

270
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,320
Basically,

271
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,560
that's how things are.

272
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,000
Is the coach okay?

273
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,800
He's alright.

274
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,960
A month of bed rest, and he should be fine.

275
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,200
But in the future,

276
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,600
he has to quit smoking and drinking.

277
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,920
The coach said

278
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
not to go see him,

279
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,000
prepare for the competition instead.

280
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,600
That's good. I was so worried.

281
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,800
Not bad, Sa.

282
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
You've suddenly

283
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,720
transformed into our coach.

284
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,480
There's another thing.

285
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,400
I'll let the captain tell you about it.

286
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
What is it, Hao?

287
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,600
Tell us.

288
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,720
You're making me nervous.

289
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,520
The topic for the debate on Friday is out.

290
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,400
Is it ever necessary to conceal something out of kindness?

291
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,920
We're opposing, it's not necessary.

292
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,600
I think we have the advantage.

293
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
This is the first competition

294
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,880
of this

295
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
semester.

296
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,080
I hope you'll all prepare for it.

297
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,920
Don't worry, Hao.

298
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,920
We have the best debater

299
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,600
in our team.

300
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,720
Then, Sa.

301
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,440
We'll go organize things

302
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,840
for the day of the competition...

303
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,200
Right.

304
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,640
There's still a lot of stuff

305
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,280
we haven't sorted out.

306
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,960
You guys prepare for the competition.

307
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
What are you doing

308
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,560
with this many balloons?

309
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,720
Oh!

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,120
They're for

311
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,160
an early victory celebration!

312
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,160
Yeah!

313
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,480
We're gonna win!

314
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,920
Get ready for the competition.

315
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,720
Quick.

316
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,240
Hurry.

317
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,600
Don't delay my confession!

318
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,960
You just told them

319
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
to keep preparing for the debate.

320
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,720
Is there a way

321
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,640
we can get the competition back?

322
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,120
No.

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,360
No?

324
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,320
No.

325
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,520
Seeing how excited they were for the debate,

326
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,840
I just couldn't bear to

327
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,400
tell them.

328
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,640
And I still want to try again.

329
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,080
They may seem to be

330
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,960
messing around every day,

331
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,400
they all love debating.

332
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,120
So,

333
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm going to talk to

334
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,040
Mr. Li tomorrow and try again.

335
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,320
Are you with me?

336
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,480
Of course.

337
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
Now I'm still

338
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,880
your coach.

339
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,280
Of course, I'll fight with you

340
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,120
until the end.

341
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,240
Last night,

342
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,160
I made a long list of reasons

343
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,080
why she'd want to know

344
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,960
and why she wouldn't.

345
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,920
I got the same number for both.

346
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,480
How do you know that

347
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,640
Dango wouldn't want to know?

348
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Just put yourself in her shoes!

349
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
For example, you've been looking at a restaurant for a long time,

350
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
and you finally got to eat there.

351
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,200
Then I tell you,

352
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,720
this restaurant is absolutely disgusting and

353
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,600
dirty.

354
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,280
I'd be unhappy.

355
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,960
But at least it's the truth.

356
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,840
You can't fix anything by hiding it.

357
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,280
Then what can I fix now?

358
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,600
I can't fix that guy.

359
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
I can't fix anything.

360
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,280
Isn't Dango

361
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
the only one I can fix?

362
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,920
Yeah.

363
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,000
What would you like?

364
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,320
Three pork burgers.

365
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,520
Three pork burgers, alright.

366
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,560
That's 21 in total.

367
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,320
Just give me 20.

368
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,400
He didn't see.

369
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,680
What are you doing?

370
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:03,920
I...

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,520
Nothing...

372
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Where did you put the money?

373
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,120
I...

374
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,560
I told you.

375
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,760
People don't believe things

376
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,880
they don't see with their own eyes.

377
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,560
These people...

378
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,600
What the...

379
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,440
Give him the money.

380
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,720
Look how little I have left.

381
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,720
Dango.

382
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,840
That day I was

383
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,160
out shopping...

384
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,600
It's Hao.

385
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,920
Hao?

386
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,000
Here.

387
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,640
What are you doing?

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
There are balloons in the back.

389
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,200
Hao.

390
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,200
How are preparations for the debate going?

391
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,320
Have you been slacking off?

392
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,320
Relax.

393
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,400
We wouldn't slack off.

394
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,800
This competition is very important.

395
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
You need to really go for it!

396
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm still be the first speaker this time.

397
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,600
I'll send over my draft

398
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,400
of points in a second.

399
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,200
You guys sort out the structure.

400
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,520
We'll discuss it later.

401
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,360
OK.

402
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,880
I don't know

403
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,560
whether Mr. Li will agree or not.

404
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,880
Don't be nervous.

405
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,640
Let's do our best.

406
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,800
Dango,

407
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,280
that day I went shopping...

408
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,760
Hello?

409
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,880
Is this Mu Xiaoyu?

410
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Your package has arrived.

411
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm downstairs now.

412
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,680
It's glass,

413
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,600
you'll need to come down and sign for it.

414
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,400
Coming.

415
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,840
Hey!

416
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,440
Dango, this is bad!

417
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,680
The situation has changed.

418
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,560
Your Prince Charming's

419
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,880
second period class

420
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,800
moved to first period.

421
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
He's about to leave the dormitory now

422
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,000
and go to Building One!

423
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,200
- OK. - There's not much time.

424
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,920
You and Xiaoyu should come quickly.

425
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,280
No!

426
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,040
I...

427
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,160
Where is Dango?

428
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
The confession has been moved forward.

429
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,280
What?

430
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,960
Do you want to go and have a look?

431
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm not going.

432
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
I didn't tell her just now.

433
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,920
I can't go to the execution ground

434
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,040
and see her get rejected.

435
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm not going.

436
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,720
Hey.

437
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,200
Have you considered

438
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
there might be a worse possibility?

439
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,480
What?

440
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,040
What if

441
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
the guy agrees?

442
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,240
If he is such a scum,

443
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,880
I'll never forgive him!

444
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,320
Hey!

445
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,160
Together!

446
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,080
You're shouting too early.

447
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Senpai, I...

448
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,040
Sorry, I have a class to go to.

449
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,760
I'm off.

450
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,360
It's okay, Dango.

451
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,400
Stop crying.

452
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,480
When we leave this hot pot restaurant

453
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,320
you'll definitely find a more handsome,

454
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,000
and better guy.

455
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,720
Dango.

456
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier

457
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,600
it was Liu Yanze?

458
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,480
If you'd told me it was him,

459
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,000
I wouldn't have let you go.

460
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,840
You two know each other?

461
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,920
I more than know him.

462
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,040
We're enemies.

463
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,640
You're enemies? What happened?

464
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,400
It's a long story.

465
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Basically we two are irreconcilable.

466
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,600
Being mysterious, huh?

467
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,720
Xiaoyu.

468
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,280
I should have listened to you before.

469
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
I shouldn't be so impulsive.

470
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,440
I knew it!

471
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,880
From now on,

472
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm going to wait for a

473
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,240
Prince Charming to chase me.

474
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,000
That's the spirit!

475
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,520
Cheers to that!

476
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Cheers!

477
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,880
Cheers!

478
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,520
Cheers.

479
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,120
Hao sent a message.

480
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,720
She's asking where we are.

481
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Let's take a picture for her.

482
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
Say we'll go back straight after we finish eating.

483
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,960
My makeup is all smudged. Let me fix it.

484
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,720
The photos are still there.

485
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,520
The date of this photo was taken

486
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,480
a few days ago.

487
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,080
You already knew!

488
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,000
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,320
Yeah, why didn't you tell her?

490
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,920
I'm also responsible.

491
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,960
Dango.

492
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,920
Actually, we wanted to tell you.

493
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,280
Then why didn't you?

494
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,880
We had our reasons.

495
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
What reasons?

496
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
You kept such a big thing from me!

497
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,280
It's about that, Dango,

498
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,520
we didn't have any proof.

499
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,720
Right?

500
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,480
They checked into a room, isn't that proof?

501
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,280
What if they were practicing scripts together?

502
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,360
What are you talking about?

503
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,520
He said that.

504
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:06,920
Me?

505
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,480
It was me.

506
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,360
Dango, I know you are angry.

507
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,920
I also feel bad.

508
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,120
Ever since I knew about this,

509
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,520
I haven't felt at ease for a moment.

510
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,880
Not for one moment.

511
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,160
But I convinced myself,

512
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,680
what if this guy likes you, too?

513
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,320
What if this guy says yes?

514
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,320
Then I'll be his mistress!

515
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah.

516
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,560
She'll be his mistress!

517
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,880
I can testify,

518
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,760
she really didn't think of that,

519
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,240
really.

520
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,320
She didn't think about that?

521
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,280
Then did you two ever think,

522
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,120
you two are my best friends,

523
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
you knew the truth,

524
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,000
and didn't tell me.

525
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Do you know how sad I am now?

526
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
Dango, drink some Coke.

527
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,280
Shut up!

528
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,040
Ouch!

529
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,880
Mu Xiaoyu.

530
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,200
I don't care that I got rejected,

531
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,240
it's not the first time, is it?

532
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,520
You,

533
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
and Nanbei,

534
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,760
you two keeping secrets from me,

535
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
is what disappointed me!

536
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,840
Don't yell at him.

537
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
It has nothing to do with him.

538
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,120
It was all my idea.

539
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,720
You said it too just now

540
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,840
we are best friends.

541
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
I was really afraid

542
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,680
that after you found out this

543
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,520
you'd be really sad.

544
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,440
Am I not sad now anyway?

545
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,040
Ah!

546
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,960
There's no trust

547
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,200
among us at all!

548
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,520
We shouldn't be friends at all!

549
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,880
Dango!

550
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,680
Calm down.

551
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,840
Put yourself in our shoes

552
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,400
and think about it.

553
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,680
Really,

554
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,400
it's not an easy thing

555
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,080
to tell.

556
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,040
Really, there is too much taboo.

557
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,120
Like when I lost Xiaoyu's

558
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,600
Little Xiaoyu,

559
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,200
I was afraid to say anything.

560
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,320
I was really scared.

561
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
It was too hard.

562
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,680
What are you talking about?

563
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:22,800
No!

564
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,240
They're doing life-drawing at the comic book club tomorrow.

565
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,920
You two tell Hao

566
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,760
I'm not going to the competition.

567
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,440
No!

568
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,240
If you don't we'll be short-handed.

569
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,600
Get a substitute.

570
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,680
Dango.

571
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,520
Where's my son?

572
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,400
He...

573
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
...ran away from home.

574
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,320
No.

575
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,520
Mr. Li,

576
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,440
We understand that when two schools merge,

577
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,800
you need to choose a new school team.

578
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,200
But we're both school teams,

579
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,600
isn't it too arbitrary

580
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,880
to just pick the Western University of Science and Technology team?

581
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,480
Let me tell you something.

582
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,560
About that,

583
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,800
you're not the only ones fighting for it.

584
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,680
As soon as the merger was announced,

585
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,080
Captain Liu Yanze

586
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,960
from the Western University of Science and Technology's team

587
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,800
has been fighting for it.

588
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,600
They've recently participated

589
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,400
in several high-level competitions.

590
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,120
You've seen too.

591
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,200
They won them all.

592
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,320
But...

593
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,880
I hope you can understand.

594
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,840
This is

595
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,560
not something I can decide

596
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,360
on my own.

597
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,240
I have work to do.

598
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,000
Why don't you head back?

599
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,880
Mr. Li...

600
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,800
Go back.

601
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,400
- Go back. - Mr. Li!

602
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,680
Go back.

603
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,480
Maybe you were right.

604
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,280
I should have told Dango.

605
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,120
I wish I had listened to you.

606
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,080
Dango is still angry.

607
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,480
When her anger subsides and she calms down,

608
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,520
I'm sure she can understand.

609
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,440
Then we'll wait for her to come back,

610
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,920
and apologize to her.

611
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,880
Where's Dango?

612
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,360
There's something I need to tell you.

613
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Something happened with Dango.

614
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,560
She might not be able

615
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,280
to come to tomorrow's competition.

616
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,960
Hm.

617
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,040
See?

618
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,080
This is what happened.

619
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,920
It seems like

620
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,240
you three

621
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,480
haven't prepared for the competition.

622
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
Hao, don't be angry.

623
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,520
We'll go prepare now.

624
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,480
It's not too late.

625
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,360
Let's go.

626
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,320
There's no need.

627
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,000
After the school merger,

628
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,400
it was decided

629
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,800
that the Western University of Science and Technology

630
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,680
will serve as the school team.

631
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,320
Our team

632
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,000
has been disbanded.

633
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,280
Why? How?

634
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,680
Calm down.

635
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,320
Sit.

636
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:48,960
No,

637
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,360
why are they disbanding our team?

638
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,080
Right!

639
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,520
Why can't

640
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,560
their team be disbanded?

641
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,640
Mr. Li showed me

642
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,560
their competition results from last year.

643
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,920
They were a lot better than us.

644
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,520
Ours weren't bad!

645
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,200
We had ups and downs,

646
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
but there were times when we did really well.

647
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
Why don't we compete with them and see who's best?

648
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,560
We won't necessarily win.

649
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,520
Their captain Liu Yanze

650
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,880
is said to have won so many best debater titles.

651
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,720
Liu Yanze...

652
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,040
Here comes a chance for revenge.

653
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,720
We'll settle our old scores and new.

654
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,040
What do you mean?

655
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
He's the guy in the video

656
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,840
who bullied Dango.

657
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,880
This is all because of him.

658
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,840
Let's go over there and settle this.

659
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,320
Let's go!

660
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,160
Come back.

661
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,400
Come back.

662
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,600
Calm down, sit.

663
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,320
Sit down.

664
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
What are you doing?

665
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,960
Thrashing around and making a scene.

666
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,800
If that works,

667
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,800
we'd have

668
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,960
done that today.

669
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
This is also difficult for me to accept.

670
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,680
But Mr. Li has made it clear

671
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,600
and said no to us.

672
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,720
There really is no way.

673
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,600
Do you remember how I used to

674
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,480
teach you all?

675
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,240
For anything,

676
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,880
the most effective solution is

677
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,960
to find the pain point.

678
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,600
You've done

679
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,480
good work here.

680
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:22,920
Right,

681
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,760
what you said

682
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,400
was exactly what I was thinking.

683
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,800
Yes.

684
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,240
Well...

685
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,600
What have you planned

686
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,120
for your future work?

687
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,560
What's going on here?

688
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,560
Come.

689
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,960
First team, go.

690
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,080
Alpha, go.

691
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Everybody, go.

692
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,280
Go!

693
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,640
Hello, Vice-Chancellor.

694
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,400
I'm Nanbei from the debate team.

695
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,840
Welcome to our university.

696
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,040
What's going on here?

697
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,640
Is this a surprise

698
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,360
your organized for me, Mr. Li?

699
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,680
This...

700
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,720
Vice-Chancellor,

701
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,560
this is a welcoming ceremony

702
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,080
volunteered and organized

703
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,480
by our school debate team.

704
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh!

705
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,080
There's a card, too!

706
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,040
Let me see.

707
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,200
I love you.

708
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,160
Huh?

709
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,600
Be with me.

710
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,320
Let me look.

711
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,120
No.

712
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,600
Well, Vice-Chancellor...

713
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,600
I... I love you means

714
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,280
all the members of our school debate team

715
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,320
are all very grateful for your

716
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,240
long-standing support.

717
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,120
It also means that

718
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,800
we hope we can

719
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,960
be with you forever.

720
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,960
How heartfelt.

721
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,680
Thank you.

722
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,960
So,

723
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,520
you're

724
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,280
a member of the debate team?

725
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:01,880
Yes.

726
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm very proud

727
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,320
to be a member of the debate team.

728
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,320
It's just that...

729
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,000
Just what?

730
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,760
Mr. Li said

731
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,520
our debate team

732
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,760
will be disbanded soon.

733
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,800
Li,

734
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,440
you can't beat down

735
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,000
the motivation

736
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,640
of such passionate students.

737
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,800
Right.

738
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,040
But Vice-Chancellor-

739
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,600
Mr. Li.

740
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,320
We still have another

741
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,000
competition in a bit.

742
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,480
If we win

743
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,400
the competition,

744
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,880
could you reconsider?

745
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,400
Keep your distance!

746
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,200
Vice-Chancellor,

747
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
we also hope that

748
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,680
you and Mr. Li

749
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,040
can come watch our competition.

750
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,000
A competition?

751
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,720
Right?

752
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,600
OK.

753
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,440
This reminds me of my

754
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,880
exciting college life.

755
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,560
Hm.

756
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,280
I think we can.

757
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,400
But, Chancellor,

758
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,200
there's a lot

759
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,160
of work to do at my office.

760
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,200
- I need to get back. - Mr. Li.

761
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,920
Your office work

762
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,120
can be done without you.

763
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,960
What do you say?

764
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,040
Alright.

765
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,400
Chancellor,

766
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,560
how about this?

767
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,880
This afternoon

768
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,120
we'll go and watch the debate.

769
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,120
Suppose that they win

770
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,040
as a result,

771
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,880
we'll reopen our discussion

772
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,200
on the debate team issue.

773
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,000
What do you think?

774
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,200
Sure.

775
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,560
You know, students.

776
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,880
Their activities

777
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,920
are all about results.

778
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,680
Right?

779
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,280
Do your best!

780
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,440
Win,

781
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,140
and we can reconsider.

782
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,800
Great!

783
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,680
Thank you, sir.

784
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,520
Thank you, sir.

785
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,880
Together!

786
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,240
You don't need to shout that.

787
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,880
Reconsider.

788
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,240
What does that word mean?

789
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,200
It means hope.

790
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,480
It means a lighthouse in the ocean.

791
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,280
The rays of dawn in the dark.

792
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,360
Gorky once said...

793
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,040
Mr. Sa,

794
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
we don't even have enough people.

795
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,360
Do you think that while

796
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,120
you lovely students

797
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,720
were shooting your shot,

798
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,920
as your teacher

799
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,320
I'd do nothing?

800
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,640
Let me introduce,

801
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,000
an outstanding student from Dongcai University's Chinese department,

802
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,720
winner of the national scholarship

803
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,160
for three consecutive years,

804
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,360
Gong.

805
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,200
H... ello, every... one.

806
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,640
I'm Gong.

807
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Come here.

808
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,560
What's going on?

809
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,720
He's the only one who signed up.

810
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Make do with him.

811
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
How can we make do with him?

812
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
How?

813
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,680
Do your best.

814
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,920
We don't have much time.

815
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
Just a few hours.

816
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,320
The opponent is Donggang University of Political Science.

817
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
They're also a strong team.

818
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,560
We should take them seriously.

819
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,280
Come on, let's start with rebuttals.

820
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,880
But I don't think there's enough time.

821
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,240
Isn't it better to use common sense

822
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
and do the structure first?

823
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,440
Guys, to be on the safe side

824
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,800
I think we should start

825
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,560
with data research.

826
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,880
There's definitely no time for that.

827
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,000
If there is not enough time,

828
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,840
we should do rebuttals first,

829
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,040
build our speeches and rebuttals at the same time.

830
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,120
But usually...

831
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,480
Usually we do rebuttals first.

832
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,120
For us...

833
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,720
It's important to be on the safe side...

834
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,320
Data research...

835
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
Alright.

836
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,000
Listen to me.

837
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
You...

838
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,480
We don't have much time. Don't make trouble.

839
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,200
Let's just do

840
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,880
what we're best at.

841
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,280
Me and Xiaoyu will do the rebuttals.

842
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,280
Hao,

843
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,680
make a structure based on

844
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,480
some common knowledge information.

845
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,240
Sa,

846
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,320
we're leave the rebuttal points

847
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,920
for you to organize.

848
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:17,760
Gong.

849
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,680
Help Sa.

850
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,520
Find data and info to support the argument.

851
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,040
Alright?

852
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,720
No problems?

853
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,360
Let's get started.

854
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,520
Can't you be normal?

855
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,400
Making so much noise all the time.

856
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,120
Weren't the debate team

857
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,000
from Dongcai University disbanded?

858
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,400
Why has the competition this afternoon been rescheduled?

859
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,560
They thought if they won the competition

860
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,800
they could compete with us

861
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,560
to become the school debate team.

862
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,680
They're dreaming.

863
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,240
Gong.

864
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,880
You are crucial

865
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
to the outcome

866
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,640
of this competition.

867
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm sure you all know.

868
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,560
Today,

869
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,400
it's a battle for our survival.

870
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:18,840
Go for it.

871
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,040
Let's go.

872
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,920
There's no time to get emotional.

873
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,040
I already knew about

874
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,000
the Western University of Science and Technology's plot.

875
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,480
How is the preparation of

876
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,080
argument points going?

877
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,920
Let me have a look.

878
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,480
And get me something to wear for the competition.

879
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
Even though my storyline was cut,

880
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,240
I still find this really exciting!

881
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,760
After hearing excellent points and questions

882
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
from both sides,

883
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,160
next let's hear from

884
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,720
the third speakers on each side.

885
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,840
Debate one-to-one.

886
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,840
Third speakers, please begin.

887
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,640
Hello, opponent.

888
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,360
Hello, opponent.

889
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,440
May I ask my opponent,

890
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,080
concealing something out of kindness,

891
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,040
is kind to everyone?

892
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,720
Yes.

893
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,000
Kind to you and kind to him.

894
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,480
Everyone benefits.

895
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,320
So why not do it?

896
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,080
I'll give an example,

897
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,640
if a companion of my friend

898
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,680
went into a hotel with a stranger.

899
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,880
I would rather tear down ten temples

900
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
than destroy a relationship.

901
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,960
And I concealed this.

902
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,040
But in the end, there was no concealing the truth.

903
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,760
She lost her love.

904
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,480
I lost a friend.

905
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,400
But who benefits from

906
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,360
that kindness?

907
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,440
No one.

908
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,200
Isn't that exactly

909
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,960
what happens when you fail to conceal something?

910
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,440
I'm afraid my opponent is demonstrating

911
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,280
our side's point of view.

912
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,360
He turned it around on them.

913
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,400
And if I had succeeded in concealing it

914
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,000
then that friend

915
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,800
would have been cheated on

916
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,120
and you'd be unaffected.

917
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,840
This is totally different

918
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,560
from the "good for everybody" theory

919
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,320
you were talking about.

920
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,680
My opponent,

921
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,400
this is a misinterpretation of our side's

922
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,840
criteria for judging kindness.

923
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,360
I didn't ask about the criteria.

924
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
I asked about the definition.

925
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,600
Since you can't prove

926
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,640
your own definition,

927
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,400
then,

928
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,640
what are the criteria for judging kindness?

929
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,440
Our side believes that

930
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,920
judging whether

931
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,760
something is concealed out of kindness or not

932
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,120
is about who bears the consequences.

933
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,560
If I bear

934
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,640
the consequences of what I concealed,

935
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,680
that's kindness.

936
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,240
If you bear the consequences yourself, then it's kindness.

937
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,120
So these consequences

938
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,360
are bad, right?

939
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
You can interpret it like that.

940
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Then why would an act of kindness

941
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,600
bring with it

942
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,360
bad consequences?

943
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,160
Who says acts of kindness

944
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,200
will definitely have good consequences?

945
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,640
If you know there will be bad consequences,

946
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,880
it can't be called an act of kindness.

947
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,280
Not concealing it would bring

948
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,920
greater harm.

949
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,840
And if you hide it

950
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,800
you can minimize the damage.

951
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,760
This is the best solution.

952
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
Does the opposition not understand?

953
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,760
So the precondition of concealing something

954
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
out of kindness is

955
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,240
is being unkind to yourself?

956
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,920
Your argument

957
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,760
contradicts itself again.

958
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,680
For the third time.

959
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,200
My opponent,

960
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,400
I wish you wouldn't hold on all the time to...

961
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,280
They cut off a large part of the battlefield.

962
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,520
It'll be easier from now on.

963
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,400
Free debate,

964
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,760
attack on points one, three and four.

965
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,600
Next is what you've all been looking forward to,

966
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,240
the intense and exciting free debate.

967
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,280
In the free debate

968
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
each side has four minutes.

969
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,240
We'll begin with the opposing side.

970
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:44,840
Go ahead.

971
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,040
If one of your friends at work

972
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,640
made a mistake,

973
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,960
and the company talked to you for his background check

974
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,280
would you conceal it for your friend?

975
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,680
If my friend had really changed

976
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,520
then I would conceal it

977
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,280
and give him a chance.

978
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,760
This is what we mean by the best solution.

979
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,560
But this concealment is out of

980
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,320
kindness to your friend,

981
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,600
but has ill intent towards the new company.

982
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,520
May I ask, is an ill-intent concealment

983
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,320
also necessary?

984
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,840
Concealment out of kindness is necessary.

985
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,720
That doesn't mean

986
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,360
it's necessary at

987
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,640
any given time.

988
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,520
So your view is,

989
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,240
concealment out of kindness

990
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,160
is sometimes necessary

991
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,400
and sometimes unnecessary.

992
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,000
With all due respect,

993
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,960
isn't that nonsense?

994
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,680
This point has been won.

995
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,680
Let's look at necessity.

996
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,520
When you're in love

997
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,400
and out of kindness,

998
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,320
conceal some of your past,

999
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,640
won't it reduce conflicts with your partner?

1000
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,480
Is that necessary?

1001
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,280
That's not reducing conflict,

1002
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,080
that's a hidden bomb.

1003
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,040
According to your logic,

1004
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,760
when you get married

1005
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,480
is it necessary

1006
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,080
to conceal your family and

1007
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,960
financial situation?

1008
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,880
My opponent's example

1009
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,560
is of concealment with ill intent.

1010
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,160
When I'm in love,

1011
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,880
and my partner

1012
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,760
asks for details about me

1013
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,400
and my ex-girlfriend,

1014
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,040
I conceal them.

1015
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,640
Isn't that better

1016
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,400
than just directly talking about it?

1017
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Your partner doesn't need

1018
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,440
to know about it.

1019
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,360
Then this is not called concealment.

1020
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,600
If we call this concealment too,

1021
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
then does a teacher conceal

1022
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,760
the test questions before an exam?

1023
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,960
When something is concealed out of kindness,

1024
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,400
doesn't the person who is being lied to have the right to know?

1025
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,240
Not necessarily.

1026
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,440
For example, when we're studying away from home,

1027
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,360
if we encounter problems,

1028
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,040
don't we often not want to

1029
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,680
make our parents worry,

1030
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,200
and conceal it out of kindness?

1031
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,200
All primary school kids know

1032
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,240
the story of the wolf.

1033
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,120
If it goes on like that,

1034
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,760
parents can no longer believe you

1035
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,320
when you tell them you're as safe and sound.

1036
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
and get even more worried.

1037
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,600
What can they do?

1038
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,760
So you can also

1039
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,960
choose to tell the truth.

1040
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
So you admit that

1041
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,120
I can choose not to hide it?

1042
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,800
Wouldn't that be consenting

1043
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,040
that concealment isn't necessary?

1044
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,720
My opponent,

1045
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,640
you shouldn't play word games.

1046
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,400
Let's talk about

1047
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,040
a serious topic.

1048
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,480
In the face

1049
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,360
of a terminally ill patient,

1050
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,240
a better state of mind

1051
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,120
is obviously more conducive

1052
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,680
to his treatment.

1053
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,480
So at this time,

1054
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,760
isn't the doctor's concealment

1055
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,480
necessary?

1056
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,840
Of course not.

1057
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,240
From September 1st, 2012,

1058
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,000
Regulations on the

1059
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,920
Treatment of Medical Malpractice,

1060
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,160
Article 11 expressly stipulates that

1061
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,680
doctors should check the patient's condition

1062
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,360
and truthfully

1063
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,120
and timely tell them the answer.

1064
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,760
My opponent has concealed the second part of that article.

1065
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
There's another sentence that says

1066
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
adverse consequences to

1067
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,920
the patient should be avoided.

1068
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,720
Is concealment necessary

1069
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,680
during a competition?

1070
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,760
It's not.

1071
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,360
You see,

1072
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,560
that concealment by our fourth speaker

1073
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,240
made us pay

1074
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,000
the price of mistake.

1075
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
And you got applause.

1076
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,160
Doesn't this mean that,

1077
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,240
concealment is not only unnecessary,

1078
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,360
it's also inadvisable?

1079
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,200
The opposition is out of time.

1080
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
The proposition still has 17 seconds.

1081
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,880
There's so much time left

1082
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,360
for the other side to attack.

1083
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,760
We'll be in a very passive position.

1084
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,240
What are they going to do?

1085
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
However, my opponent,

1086
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,720
very often the truth

1087
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,360
brings harm with it.

1088
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,320
Is this kind of concealment

1089
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,440
really unnecessary?

1090
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,440
Your side has always

1091
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
been questioning our criteria for necessity.

1092
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,440
What are yours?

1093
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,600
Is paying a price

1094
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,680
always inadvisable?

1095
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,360
My opponent seems to think

1096
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,560
that the truth is glorious,

1097
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,240
and ignoring all of the confusion,

1098
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,800
embarrassment

1099
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,400
and entanglement

1100
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,560
in life.

1101
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,480
But this is not the case.

1102
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,080
Truth is a neutral word.

1103
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,360
It can also bring harm.

1104
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,960
Can't it?

1105
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,080
Time's up.

1106
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,320
The opposition's second speaker has the right

1107
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,080
to launch a surprise attack.

1108
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Do you choose to make an inquiry

1109
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,760
or a statement?

1110
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,560
A statement.

1111
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,440
My opponent said

1112
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
that truth can bring harm

1113
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,120
so concealment is necessary.

1114
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,480
My opponent,

1115
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,200
truth does no harm.

1116
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,880
When truth is ignored,

1117
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,080
it will bring harm.

1118
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,640
It will hurt

1119
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,440
the thing we hold most dear,

1120
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,520
trust.

1121
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Just a few days ago,

1122
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,920
I hid something

1123
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,160
from my best friend

1124
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,440
out of self-righteous kindness.

1125
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,400
And that moment when

1126
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,280
she learned the truth,

1127
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,960
the way she looked at me

1128
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,920
smashed that self-righteousness

1129
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,840
to pieces.

1130
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,440
Because in her eyes

1131
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,080
there was only disappointment.

1132
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Was it because my intentions

1133
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,840
weren't kind enough?

1134
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,840
Or that my concealment

1135
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,520
led to bad consequences?

1136
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,280
It was neither.

1137
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,960
What really made her angry

1138
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,960
was precisely that concealment itself.

1139
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,400
Even if you say

1140
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,320
it's for their own good,

1141
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,560
even if it's given

1142
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,720
the name of kindness.

1143
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,320
There are many things in this world,

1144
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,280
caring for friends,

1145
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,640
concern for loved ones,

1146
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,400
those can all be described

1147
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,360
as kindness.

1148
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,080
It seems that as long as you add "kindness,"

1149
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,000
bad things will become better,

1150
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,240
concealment will become a necessity,

1151
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,000
and going beyond the line will become natural.

1152
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,440
But is that kindness?

1153
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,360
That's arrogance.

1154
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,080
Anything I do for "your own good,"

1155
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
is announcing loudly

1156
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,920
that I'll make a decision for you.

1157
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,760
But which one of us has

1158
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,560
the right to make

1159
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
decisions for others?

1160
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,480
Why should we force our

1161
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,360
judgments of good or bad

1162
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,640
onto others

1163
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,720
and ask them to

1164
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,040
be grateful for it?

1165
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,720
Please be honest with each other,

1166
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,680
because nobody

1167
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,320
wants to live

1168
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,280
in the cage of ignorance.

1169
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,960
Thank you.

1170
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,400
I'm telling you,

1171
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,000
separating us

1172
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,720
isn't that easy!

1173
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,400
Right!

1174
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,200
We three sisters,

1175
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,960
three swords united!

1176
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,280
No one can beat us!

1177
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
So we're good now, right?

1178
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,680
When were we bad?

1179
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,840
Guys.

1180
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,040
Guys.

1181
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,640
I haven't prepared anything,

1182
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,040
but at this moment,

1183
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,640
I would like to say a few words.

1184
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,600
Gorky once said...

1185
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,480
Mr. Li is calling.

1186
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:26,880
Mr. Li.

1187
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Hello, Hao.

1188
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,760
Ask all members

1189
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,400
of the debate team to come to my office

1190
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,600
for a meeting tomorrow.

1191
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,520
The school team issue

1192
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,200
has been decided.

1193
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,560
And?

1194
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,040
A merger.

1195
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,760
A merger?

1196
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,280
Even though

1197
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,800
you narrowly won the debate,

1198
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,160
their team

1199
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,480
beat last year's

1200
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,560
national champion, South Jiaotong University.

1201
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,640
You could say

1202
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,240
merging is the best outcome

1203
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,960
I could have achieved.

1204
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,280
How about this?

1205
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,600
I'll send you

1206
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,200
their information.

1207
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,680
Have a look.

1208
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,280
What's the matter?

1209
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,880
Yin Nan.

1210
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,360
Who is Yin Nan?

1211
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,040
Xiaoyu's enemy.
