Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP22

2
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,280
Captain,

3
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,240
you're still here?

4
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Captain, are you analyzing

5
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
our contest against team two?

6
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,040
What's your opinion on

7
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
our last contest with them?

8
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
I think team two did

9
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,160
pretty well in the last match.

10
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
It was really a hair's breadth between winning and losing.

11
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,640
Honestly, we were lucky that time.

12
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
We were on the brink of losing.

13
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,920
They've improved significantly,

14
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,840
making me see them in a new light.

15
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,720
But unfortunately, there can only be one winner.

16
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,720
They won't make it to the provincial-level contest.

17
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,680
Or I am

18
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
looking forward to

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
another contest with them.

20
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
Bro, I get

21
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,120
how you're feeling right now.

22
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,920
We've all experienced this. I get it.

23
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
What?

24
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,920
Xiaoyu's good,

25
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,600
but if it's bound to be that way,

26
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,720
you can't force it.

27
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,160
No.

28
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,800
It's fine.

29
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,680
Every man has got to experience

30
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,320
a couple of breakups.

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm just…

32
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,320
Don't worry.

33
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
Let me introduce to you a thing.

34
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
A blessing for all otaku to have girlfriends.

35
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
Just by entering

36
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,480
your personal information,

37
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
childhood experience, and spouse standard,

38
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
they'll immediately pair you up with a girl

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,240
of similar experience,

40
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
interests,

41
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,520
and taste.

42
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
It's my little secret.

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,280
Don't underestimate it.

44
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
I've already matched with a girl

45
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,240
and we're 95%

46
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,000
compatible.

47
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,160
We've been chatting on and off.

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,880
So,

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
people need to look forward.

50
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
We didn't break up.

51
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,560
I know you too well.

52
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,800
Stop being stubborn.

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
I lost the match

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
and I didn't get into the provincial contest.

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,160
So…

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,800
Cheers!

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,880
Cheers!

58
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,600
Mmm.

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,240
Mmm.

60
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,440
Mmm.

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,360
Mmm.

62
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,000
Mmm.

63
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,160
I'm glad that you're all

64
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,120
looking well.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,520
I was wondering

66
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,560
if you'd be dejected

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,120
like what you were the last time

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
you lost to team one.

69
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
Well, we were novices back then.

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,640
Defeats are normal on the battlefield.

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
In my opinion,

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,200
a competition goes like this.

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,240
This is a competition.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,640
It's fine.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,120
We'll try harder next year.

76
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,720
We'll try harder.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,840
Or

78
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,040
I'll come back and coach you guys.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,800
You

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,320
should just stay down for another year.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,840
Come on, get eating.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
This attic is very nice.

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,240
I used to think that I'd be

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,360
able to do many things in college.

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,400
In hindsight,

86
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
there's really nothing much to do.

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,240
It's fine. You can come back and visit in the future.

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,200
Yes!

89
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Come back whenever you like.

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,840
When you come back, we can watch a movie.

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,720
If you flank a class,

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
you'll have somewhere to review too.

93
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,640
By the way,

94
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Dandan has

95
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,520
been carrying a video camera

96
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,400
with him all around.

97
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,880
He said he wanted to record

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,120
some vlogs for our debate team.

99
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,120
I've got the clips with me.

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,040
Do you guys want to have a look?

101
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Sure!

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
Of course! Let's take a look.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,600
He's a horrible person, seriously.

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,840
Have some tea.

105
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,880
Wake yourself up.

106
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
Hands off!

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,760
Xiong Zishi

108
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,120
Mr. Sa

109
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,640
I slipped

110
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,200
by accident.

111
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,360
I didn't do it on purpose.

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Perfect!

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,240
Do you know how

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,560
I removed the paint?

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,720
Well, I couldn't.

116
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,560
That's enough.

117
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Hao, look!

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
I declare

119
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
that the winner of this competition is

120
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Team 235.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
And I declare that the Best Debater

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,480
goes to the fourth affirmative speaker from Team AFF.

123
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,080
Ma Nan.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,480
I'd like to thank my parents,

125
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,920
every single one of my

126
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,720
team members,

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,280
and of course…

128
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,640
That's enough.

129
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
Let's put this here.

130
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,400
When we win,

131
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
we'll replace it with the real one.

132
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
Exactly.

133
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
Thank you everyone!

134
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah!

135
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,040
All's good.

136
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
There are still opportunities

137
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,200
we may have compete

138
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,280
together next year.

139
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,320
Besides, we've been caught up with debate

140
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,600
for the past two years

141
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,960
and we haven't been able to

142
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,880
enjoy the college life properly.

143
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,360
Let's enjoy

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
the second semester.

145
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,240
Yeah.

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,640
I've got so many photography exhibitions that need to get going.

147
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,400
I just feel like we've let down

148
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
our old coach.

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,960
We were so close.

150
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,080
Let's make a video call to him.

151
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,960
You guys miss him?

152
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,560
Yes.

153
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,320
Let's do this.

154
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,720
Let me connect this to the computer.

155
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Hi everyone, you're all here?

156
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,760
Coach!

157
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
Everyone's here!

158
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
How are you going?

159
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,840
It's...alright.

160
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
Let me tell you guys…

161
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,680
Coach, your mouth is

162
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,040
too close to the camera.

163
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
Okay,

164
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,360
I need to go to the bathroom. The toilet.

165
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,360
Coach! Coach!

166
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
No, no, no, coach!

167
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,960
We can see what you're doing!

168
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,720
Coach!

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,120
Oops,

170
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,600
Listen up.

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,640
What I'm about to say is very important.

173
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Listen carefully,

174
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,640
coach might be giving us

175
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,400
an analysis of the competition.

176
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,120
Listen up.

177
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,320
Firstly,

178
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
I feel horrible in the hospital right now.

179
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,960
Sa, where's the braised pork you promised?

180
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
I haven't even been able to have

181
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,920
a single peanut.

182
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
My wife is being so strict right now,

183
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
I feel like a prisoner.

184
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,440
I feel horrible right now.

185
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,200
You guys should come over.

186
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,560
Ma Nan

187
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,160
Our old coach is frail,

188
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,280
yet he's making an effort to cheer us on.

189
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,000
A man in the

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,920
twilight years of his life,

191
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,280
is still full of hope.

192
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,720
We have no excuse

193
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,520
to be lax.

194
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
Yes.

195
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,960
I bet our old coach wants to tell us

196
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,000
to never give up.

197
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
So long as we have a glimmer of hope,

198
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,840
we'll have a future.

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,640
It doesn't matter what

200
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,720
other people think of us.

201
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,440
We must have faith in ourselves.

202
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,480
Yes.

203
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,520
Kids,

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,160
did you get what I just said?

205
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes, we did!

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
Coach, we promise

207
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
that we'll try our best!

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,880
Trust us,

209
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,440
we'll definitely

210
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,200
do you proud!

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,480
We won't let you down.

212
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,400
Yes, coach,

213
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
I swear on my life

214
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,480
that I'll

215
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
refresh ourselves together.

216
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,360
There's no need to swear on your life.

217
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,520
On some intelligence.

218
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,040
Let's- let's cheer up?

219
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,280
Sure.

220
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
One, two, three,

221
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
we've got this!

222
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,080
Hey, Zishi,

223
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,760
are you free right now?

224
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,800
I want to meet you somewhere

225
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,840
to discuss some matters.

226
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,280
AI competition?

227
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,560
According to rules from the past competitions,

228
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,200
a new competition

229
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,120
like the AI match

230
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,280
has no specified

231
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,960
time limit.

232
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,320
You guys can try it.

233
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,960
Thanks.

234
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,040
But as for the details,

235
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,320
you'll have to consult the host

236
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,280
of the competition.

237
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,400
So you can be sure about it.

238
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,720
Xiaoyu, Nan Bei,

239
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,240
I wanted to let you know

240
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,600
that we have a way for getting into the provincial contest!

241
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,960
Found it!

242
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,400
I remember

243
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,080
coming across

244
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,120
this report.

245
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
But afterward,

246
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
it lost its clout.

247
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
Recently, the school's

248
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,840
AI Research Center

249
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,680
has been looking to translate

250
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,520
Israel's AI debates

251
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,720
into Chinese.

252
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,040
If they do hold a competition,

253
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,680
according the provincial competition rules,

254
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,320
for school-level debates

255
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,360
held by college debate clubs,

256
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,960
though we might not have been

257
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,680
shortlisted for the challenger's round,

258
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,800
so long as we win,

259
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,760
we'll get a point.

260
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
So does it mean that

261
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
we'll be able to compete?

262
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,120
One point exactly. It's enough.

263
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,880
But will the provincial contest committee

264
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,960
agree to this?

265
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,760
We'll never know if we don't try.

266
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
I'll go check it out

267
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,680
and see if the school is

268
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
able to help us contact

269
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
the AI competition's host.

270
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,920
How is it?

271
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
How is it?

272
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,960
The challenger's round

273
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,200
was over,

274
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,080
so

275
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,560
the committee were very reluctant

276
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
with this competition.

277
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
We're in an AI competition.

278
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
It's not conventional competitions.

279
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,000
I've done the research.

280
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
AI is classified as a novel competition mode.

281
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,760
You can apply for special competition treatment.

282
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
If it's treated as a special competition,

283
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,240
we can probably find loopholes in the rules and regulations.

284
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm good at that. I'll do it.

285
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,600
No need.

286
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,280
I've persuaded them,

287
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,240
and the committee has agreed to

288
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,160
this competition.

289
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,760
Great.

290
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,400
You must have put in a lot of effort into this.

291
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,120
Hello?

292
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,600
We would like to apply for a

293
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
one-point AI competition,

294
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,200
and count that into our score for the provincial contest.

295
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,080
Is that possible?

296
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,760
That's possible? Thank you.

297
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,200
Well, I'm a coach.

298
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,200
With greater power comes greater responsibility.

299
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,720
So long as we're able to return to the competition,

300
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,720
it doesn't hurt to

301
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,440
go the extra mile.

302
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,840
Right?

303
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,200
Sa, that's awesome!

304
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,440
Okay, okay.

305
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
Before we enter the competition,

306
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
we have another important

307
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,160
thing to do.

308
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,440
What?

309
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,880
Bro,

310
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
be a little more tolerant, will you?

311
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,240
I've considered the whole situation.

312
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
Is that not enough?

313
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,120
Am I not tolerant?

314
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,400
Nan Bei

315
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,720
We must thank Liu Yanze for

316
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,600
helping us re-enter the competition this time.

317
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,240
I don't think things are that simple.

318
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,600
Do you really think that Liu Yanze is

319
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,240
that kind of nice person?

320
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,280
Did you forget how he

321
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
tormented us?

322
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Right, Ma Nan?

323
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Objectively speaking,

324
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
I think it was only directed at you,

325
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,760
so he never left me a bad impression.

326
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,440
Fine.

327
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,520
Well, exactly.

328
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,080
So please stop

329
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,920
being narrow-minded

330
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,400
about all this, okay?

331
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,880
If he wasn't there to help us,

332
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
what was he doing it for then?

333
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I know, Hao.

334
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,840
He wants us to return to team two

335
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,200
so we will amass more points for them.

336
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,840
So then they can continue

337
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,400
tormenting us.

338
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,320
They've done with their point collection

339
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,560
last month.

340
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,960
They were the first team in our province

341
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,680
to make it into the final.

342
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,760
I know, Ma Nan.

343
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,520
What?

344
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,960
He's into Hao.

345
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm confident in Tao Hao's

346
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,760
taste.

347
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,640
I think your girlfriend should watch out.

348
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,200
My girlfriend's got taste too.

349
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,360
It's precisely because she has taste

350
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
that you'll have to watch out,

351
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,440
right?

352
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,120
What are you talking about?

353
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,280
Why are you guys here?

354
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,960
We're here to thank you

355
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,400
for letting us know

356
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,160
about the AI competition.

357
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,920
You gave us another chance

358
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,960
to continue the competition.

359
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,320
No need to thank me.

360
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,480
I didn't do anything.

361
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,760
Just treat it as a little thank

362
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
for helping team one

363
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,480
collect the points we needed.

364
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,640
So,

365
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,120
what's your purpose?

366
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,840
Aren't you scared of losing to us

367
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
after helping us?

368
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,880
Twice.

369
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,720
I've won you twice.

370
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,240
I don't mind winning you another time.

371
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
Let me tell you, I…

372
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,640
What do you want to tell him?

373
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,600
Say it.

374
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,360
Thanks.

375
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,960
Senior Liu Yanze,

376
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,000
thanks for telling us about it

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,960
this time.

378
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,760
I got really excited last time

379
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,080
so I left in a hurry

380
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,800
and forgot to thank you.

381
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,120
No problem. I'm looking forward

382
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
to debating with you guys in the next match.

383
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Well,

384
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,080
we'll leave now. Thanks again!

385
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,080
See you at the provincial contest!

386
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,320
See you at the provincial contest!

387
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Um,

388
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,280
please thank Yin Nan

389
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,200
for me.

390
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,720
I will.

391
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,640
No need to thank me.

392
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
Just treat it like a little thank

393
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
for helping team one

394
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
collect the points

395
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,120
we needed.

396
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,040
You'll just have to kneel down

397
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,240
and thank me, the great Liu Yanze,

398
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,960
for my

399
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,840
great kindness.

400
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,760
Immature.

401
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,400
He's just jealous that Liu Yanze

402
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
helped us deal with the problem.

403
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,400
I'm jealous? You're funny.

404
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,480
And really, we haven't properly dealt with

405
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
the problem

406
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,920
or the crisis as well.

407
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,040
We'll still need the help

408
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
of me to guide us to victory.

409
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,000
Our crisis will only be resolved

410
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
after winning our next competition.

411
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,560
Indeed, you are not jealous.

412
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,520
You see?

413
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,000
From the psychological perspective,

414
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,320
only when you see someone

415
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,200
as your competitor,

416
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,280
will you be jealous of them.

417
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,640
If you think that your opposition

418
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,040
is nowhere near you

419
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,120
in terms of their

420
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,760
capabilities,

421
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,680
you'll naturally not have a jealous attitude towards them.

422
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,680
Well say, Professor Ma.

423
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,400
And

424
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,280
if your opponent is much more capable than you,

425
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,320
a similar rule applies.

426
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Hear that?

427
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,520
Alright,

428
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,080
let's discuss

429
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
what we'll be facing

430
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
in the AI competition.

431
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,040
The debate topic

432
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,960
for our next competition

433
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,120
is if the development of big data reaches its acme,

434
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,000
will it do more good than harm

435
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,800
or do more harm than good

436
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,640
on the human's life.

437
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,400
We are the Team AFF.

438
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The AI competition rules

439
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,040
are changed ones based on the American rules.

440
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,480
There are mainly two aspects to consider.

441
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,440
One, is to put forth one's argument.

442
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,960
Then, it's refutation.

443
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,680
Both sides will begin with making their arguments,

444
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
then the Team NEG will begin the refutation stage.

445
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,840
Each has a minute's time limit.

446
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,920
There are two goals in total,

447
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,240
one is a rebuttal,

448
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,640
and another is to challenge with new questions.

449
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
So basically,

450
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,480
it's an extended version

451
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,600
of a free debate.

452
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
That's right.

453
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,200
But

454
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,120
you don't have to worry this time

455
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,760
about the eight second rule.

456
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
Because you'll have a minute,

457
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,240
you can say as much as you want.

458
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,400
For refuting, both sides

459
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,760
have ten minutes each to speak.

460
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,720
Taking turns.

461
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,360
But the opposite side is full of

462
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,400
AI debaters

463
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,240
and we don't have

464
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,000
fixed roles.

465
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
So whoever of us wants to speak

466
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,960
can just speak.

467
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,320
Hao,

468
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,320
you go break down the arguments.

469
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,600
Okay.

470
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,040
I think

471
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
the biggest problem now is

472
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,560
the definition of the acme of big data.

473
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,120
Charles,

474
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,240
come here.

475
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,640
Charles

476
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,640
Charles

477
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,760
What are you doing?

478
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,200
I'm asking Charles to come over.

479
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,840
I don't think it know its name

480
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,120
is Charles.

481
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,080
Keep your voice down, you'll make him feel bad.

482
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,520
Li

483
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,200
Erya

484
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,040
Erdan

485
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,720
Hammer

486
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,720
You see?

487
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,040
See, right?

488
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,680
You see?

489
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,320
Hey, senior.

490
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,080
You can't stroke him backwards.

491
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,240
You need to stroke him in the same direction as his fur,

492
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,360
or he'll feel uncomfortable.

493
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
I don't think so. Hammer?

494
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
You see? He's comfortable.

495
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,320
Right, Hammer?

496
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,840
His name is Charles.

497
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,800
It's Hammer. Hammer?

498
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,520
You see?

499
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,400
Charles, you've worked hard.

500
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,000
Hammer. See?

501
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
Hey.

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,480
Just once.

503
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,360
No, no.

504
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,680
Really, no. You can't.

505
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,640
Just a moment

506
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,440
Please, just for a second, okay?

507
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,960
You really can't.

508
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,000
We have entered

509
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,320
an incomprehensible

510
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
and deep situation.

511
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,760
What is it?

512
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,880
What are you doing?

513
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,000
Observing the enemy's situation.

514
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,800
This alpha dog really

515
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,560
has no loopholes.

516
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
That was close.

517
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,080
Let's talk about the debate topic.

518
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,360
I'm busy.

519
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,280
What are you busy with?

520
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,920
Why are you drooping your head?

521
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,040
Weren't you proud that you had that secret weapon

522
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,200
to get yourself pretty ladies?

523
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,080
At first it was.

524
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,960
The two of us went to watch

525
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,880
what the app deemed

526
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
was the perfect movie.

527
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,280
The atmosphere was quite good.

528
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,040
I went to dinner after watching the movie.

529
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
That restaurant

530
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,960
was also app-recommended.

531
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,600
But you can't just eat

532
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,640
and not chat.

533
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,920
But when I chatted,

534
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,200
some words might go wrong.

535
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
She got unhappy and ran away.

536
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,120
The app you used

537
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,160
might have been a free version.

538
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,800
The experience is relatively elementary.

539
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,320
You try paying for a membership.

540
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,920
Maybe it'll give you

541
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,280
a perfect date plan.

542
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,640
That makes sense.

543
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,000
Ma Nan

544
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,200
You use this too?

545
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,480
Let me tell you something.

546
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,440
Hao is a girl you'll never meet again,

547
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,480
even in your next life.

548
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,520
Keep her.

549
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,600
Don't be half-hearted about her.

550
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,080
Do you know why

551
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,720
I got the Best Debater in school

552
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
and you can't?

553
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,480
That's a personal attack.

554
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,600
Think about it.

555
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,640
Why can Dandan

556
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,440
match to a girl?

557
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,880
Big data.

558
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,040
If big data

559
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,480
can make him find true love…

560
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,920
That means that the development of big data

561
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,160
has reached its acme.

562
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,440
Not too silly.

563
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll download one, too.

564
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,720
I'll download one, too.

565
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,200
My girlfriend is a bit tough.

566
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,080
I'll leave it to you.

567
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,960
Nickname. This Summer is a Bit...

568
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,600
That's a quick match.

569
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,320
Hi.

570
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,280
Hi.

571
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,960
Sorry,

572
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,640
but it's my first time using this app.

573
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
What a coincidence. It's my first time, too

574
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,680
Really?

575
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,840
Hmm.

576
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,160
Let me introduce myself first.

577
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,640
I am a college student.

578
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm still at school.

579
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,880
I don't have any hobbies during my free time.

580
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,000
Please take care.

581
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,240
What about you?

582
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,760
I am a college student too.

583
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't have any special hobbies.

584
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Usually, I help classmates

585
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,440
and the teachers

586
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,000
do some things that I'm capable of doing.

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,240
Occasionally, I like to take a walk

588
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,800
and listen to music.

589
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,960
My favorite music is

590
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,200
Beethoven's piano repertoire.

591
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,600
My favorite movie is

592
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,560
"Chocolat".

593
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,080
How did you do it?

594
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,480
What do you mean?

595
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,320
You mean what I told you

596
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,240
regarding something in my middle school?

597
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,040
No, no, no.

598
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
That thing about you.

599
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,800
I haven't seen it yet.

600
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,760
What I'm asking is,

601
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,480
how can you,

602
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
in such a short time,

603
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,680
type so many words so fast?

604
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,760
Maybe it's because I type a lot

605
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,120
during study and work.

606
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,480
It's probably just a matter of habit.

607
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,800
You're an interesting girl.

608
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040
The same goes with you.

609
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,480
Hao, what are you doing?

610
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,320
You look very focused.

611
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,440
I'm just looking at

612
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,480
some things related to

613
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,120
the topics for this debate.

614
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,200
Xiaoyu.

615
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,600
What's wrong?

616
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,480
Something happened.

617
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,280
Oh gosh.

618
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,800
Why are you doing the same thing again?

619
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,360
Dango, did you forget

620
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,320
what your dad said to you

621
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,480
the last time he came?

622
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,000
No, this time it really wasn't that.

623
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
I was going to return it.

624
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,360
But I thought about it again.

625
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,240
This matter is related to our

626
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,360
current resolution.

627
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,160
So I brought it to you guys immediately.

628
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,080
Have a look.

629
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,560
I've been looking a little pale recently,

630
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,280
so I wanted to buy some blush.

631
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,920
After I bought my blush,

632
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,000
the algorithm recommended

633
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,080
a liquid foundation to me.

634
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,320
After that, it was an anchor-recommended,

635
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
must-buy lipstick color.

636
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,160
I couldn't help it

637
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,080
and bought three lipsticks.

638
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
Then something amazing happened.

639
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,400
It actually recommended a

640
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,680
cosmetic storage box.

641
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,840
Then there was the mask,

642
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,160
mirror, comb,

643
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,760
until it recommended me a

644
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,240
dressing table

645
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,200
that I absolutely cannot afford.

646
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,000
I just found out

647
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,280
I was tricked.

648
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
This is the disadvantage

649
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,080
of big data's development.

650
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
It's horrible.

651
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
What do you mean horrible?

652
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,800
You should return the order quickly.

653
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,160
Right, right, return the order quickly.

654
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,640
Have something to eat.

655
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,400
Are you hungry?

656
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,560
What do you want to eat?

657
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,720
I want to eat the fried leek dumplings.

658
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,720
Now that you say so, I want some too.

659
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,240
Dango,

660
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,080
order some for me.

661
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,160
Okay.

662
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,480
What's the matter?

663
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
Leek dumplings.

664
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,840
I never buy

665
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,520
this kind of thing.

666
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,040
The algorithm recommended it.

667
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,920
Are we being...

668
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm starting to get a little bit

669
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,240
doubtful about our motion.

670
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,960
I don't care.

671
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,120
I'm going to

672
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,280
sleep in your room tonight.

673
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
It's fine.

674
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,760
I think big data

675
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,680
is really terrible.

676
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,920
There are drawbacks everywhere.

677
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,080
But our motion is

678
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
that big data do more good than harm.

679
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,080
Whoever came up with this question has a hole in their brain.

680
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,960
To allow AI

681
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,760
manufactured using big data to argue that big data

682
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,240
do more harm than good

683
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,040
And we who suffer a lot from big data

684
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,120
to contend that it do more good than harm.

685
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,360
Do you think this question was

686
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,760
not created by human in the first place anyway?

687
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,640
Are you implying…

688
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,640
AI knows that

689
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
its own development

690
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,800
has threatened mankind?

691
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
But that's not enough for it.

692
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,400
It doesn't know

693
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360
a legitimate reason

694
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,400
for it to continue developing.

695
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,680
So it came up

696
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,040
with a resolution like this.

697
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,240
So we can come up with reasons for it.

698
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,040
But if the IQ of AI

699
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,440
still requires our help to think of reasons,

700
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,360
then I don't see why we should feel

701
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,920
threatened.

702
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,720
I think AI

703
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
is nothing to be afraid of.

704
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,760
We just have to play the emotional card.

705
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,520
Take the emotional route and it will definitely lose.

706
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,920
That's not necessarily true.

707
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
Let's try.

708
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,600
Okay.

709
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,880
Hao, phone.

710
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,800
What do you need my phone for?

711
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,640
Hey, Siri.

712
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,280
I'm here.

713
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,200
Say something nice to me.

714
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm attracted to you,

715
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,960
just like the earth is attracted by the sun.

716
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,000
I dare not get too close,

717
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,360
yet I can't escape.

718
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,520
I'll try. Let me try.

719
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,000
Describe a romantic relationship in eight words.

720
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,840
Hold your hand, and grow old with you.

721
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,680
That was cheesy.

722
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,400
I'm smitten, I'm loyal, I'm genuine, I'm yours.

723
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,120
I'm smitten with you.

724
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
I'm loyal to you.

725
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,680
I'm genuine toward you.

726
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,640
I'm yours till the end.

727
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,480
Wow.

728
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,040
Even…

729
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,760
Even Siri's

730
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,840
better than me at making Xiaoyu happy.

731
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,760
My God.

732
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,200
It's over. It's over.

733
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,800
The era when men relied on sweet talk

734
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
is now gone forever.

735
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,600
That's not a good sign.

736
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,920
Don't worry.

737
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,920
Since everyone thinks this

738
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,960
does more harm than good,

739
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,200
then we might as well

740
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,040
prepare from the perspective of the other side.

741
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,280
Wait until all the

742
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,040
drawbacks have been found,

743
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,720
and the solution

744
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,920
will naturally appear.

745
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,360
Let me show you my dark cooking

746
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,120
for lunch.

747
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,160
Scrambled eggs with moon cakes and tomatoes.

748
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,680
Isn't it bizarrely wonderful?

749
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,160
I watched a movie recently,

750
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,240
"She".

751
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
A very unconventional romance film.

752
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I've seen it, too. I like it a lot.

753
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
The film explores

754
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
the relationship between human thought

755
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
and the body,

756
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,480
as well as the sense of belonging

757
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,280
in the human emotional world.

758
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,320
Very good.

759
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,600
Although I'm not

760
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,120
so satisfied with its ending,

761
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
it's like talking to someone once,

762
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,480
unusually but absolutely frank,

763
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,560
while not knowing how to end it.

764
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,080
Hey,

765
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,040
you've been watching Tik Tok all the morning.

766
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,360
Can you focus on the class?

767
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,880
This is not my class.

768
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm here to accompany you.

769
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,760
Do you know what is

770
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,040
information cocoon?

771
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,200
Watching Tik Tok for two hours

772
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,040
seems that

773
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,560
you're choosing what you want to watch,

774
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,400
but in reality,

775
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,240
you have been deprived

776
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,920
of the right to choose.

777
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,800
You see

778
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,400
what it wants you to see.

779
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,840
You have been completely

780
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,640
controlled by big data.

781
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,320
You are getting more and more literate now.

782
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,240
That's because you're getting more vulgar.

783
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,320
This is a good point. I'll write it down.

784
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,440
Senior

785
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,000
Let me make you a pot of tea.

786
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,440
Puer tea or scented tea?

787
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,120
No, no. It's fine.

788
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I'll just pour myself a glass of water.

789
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,400
No, no. Sit. I'll go.

790
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,400
Careful, it's hot.

791
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,360
Thank you.

792
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,520
Thanks for putting in so much time and effort

793
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,840
into this debate team.

794
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
All's good, for it's part of the job.

795
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,360
Tao Hao,

796
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,640
have you been tired lately?

797
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
How about

798
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,520
leaving the work to me?

799
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,120
No, senior,

800
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,360
you can't handle it alone.

801
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,160
Let me do it.

802
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,920
Listen to me.

803
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,520
You go back to rest early.

804
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,400
You're our captain.

805
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,160
Be properly prepared for the game.

806
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760
Leave the rest of the jobs to me.

807
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,320
Thank you.

808
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,040
No problem.

809
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,400
I'll get going, then.

810
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,360
See you.

811
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,400
Why do I feel guilty?

812
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,320
Why do I feel guilty?

813
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
What kind of funny thing

814
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,920
are you two watching?

815
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,480
Nothing.

816
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,320
Just looking at some pictures

817
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,400
of cats and cucumbers.

818
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,080
You're still watching this?

819
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,040
What are you laughing at?

820
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
Dude, I met my true love.

821
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,240
I came across this girl on the app

822
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
who's really pretty.

823
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,480
The chats have been going well too.

824
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,000
You will never believe it.

825
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,640
We will meet tonight.

826
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Tonight?

827
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,400
Yeah, just tonight.

828
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,680
Meeting tonight?

829
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,000
Are you serious?

830
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
Let me see, who is it?

831
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,360
You can only take a look.

832
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,880
Like there is anything else I can do.

833
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,120
Stop making those noises, you colorman.

834
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,840
Sure, just take a look.

835
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,640
What a lucky man you are, Dandan.

836
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,480
Are you sure this isn't a badger game, right?

837
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,000
That's impossible.

838
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,240
Through my in-depth conversations with her

839
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,160
these past few days,

840
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,520
I realized the two of us are each other's true love.

841
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,480
We're meeting tonight.

842
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,080
Through these couple days of conversation,

843
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,600
I find that I have a lot in common with you.

844
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,080
It feels like a friend of mine

845
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,280
who I've known for a long time.

846
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,400
Really?

847
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
I feel the same way, too.

848
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,960
It's like we really have

849
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
known each other for a long time.

850
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,840
Very familiar.

851
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,800
I have a friend who is very much like you.

852
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,760
Serious, responsible and trustworthy.

853
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,560
She likes making

854
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,480
friends' issues

855
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,600
on her own.

856
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,520
I also have a friend like you.

857
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,880
He's usually like

858
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,360
a lackadaisical guy.

859
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,080
But I know

860
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,200
that he has actually taken to heart

861
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
everything that's happening around him.

862
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,520
He's a very good guy.

863
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,160
Congratulations on the match!

864
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,480
You have reached 100%.

865
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,200
Would you like to connect via video-calling

866
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,560
and make an appointment offline?

867
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm sorry

868
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,200
I have had a lot of things to deal with recently.

869
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,960
I won't use this

870
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,720
app ever again.

871
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,160
Sorry,

872
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,960
I need to prepare for a recent,

873
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,920
and very important exam.

874
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,040
I won't go online again.

875
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Well, I wish you all the best.

876
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,400
Take care.

877
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,760
I also wish you all the best and take care.

878
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,320
Senior.

879
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,200
Tao Hao.

880
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,440
What are you doing?

881
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,440
Taking a walk.

882
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,240
I'm taking a walk, too.

883
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,560
Why don't we walk together?

884
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,320
Actually, there's also big data out there

885
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,000
that's not reliable.

886
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,920
Threats don't necessarily come from

887
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,280
reliable big data.

888
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,040
The unreliable side of it

889
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
is being exploited by human beings

890
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,240
for wars

891
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,040
or for places like

892
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,880
nuclear power plants.

893
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,040
It's dangerous.

894
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,120
The debate is on big data

895
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,400
being developed to its acme.

896
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,600
I think the resolution

897
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,240
developing to its best

898
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,200
shouldn't have many loopholes.

899
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,080
I agree.

900
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,680
And I have been thinking during

901
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,600
the past two days

902
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,840
that if our behavior and preferences,

903
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,000
or even thinking,

904
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
are accurately predicted

905
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
by big data,

906
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,360
what our future will actually look like.

907
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,320
I don't think it will be that bad.

908
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,120
That's true.

909
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,240
Higher social operation efficiency,

910
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,200
Lower personal development costs.

911
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,040
The advantage of digitization is

912
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,120
efficiency.

913
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,880
I'll carry on with what Nan Bei was saying.

914
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,440
The core of it is

915
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,080
whether digitization of civilization or

916
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,200
the world

917
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,720
for human beings

918
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,000
better or worse?

919
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,760
That's not right.

920
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,680
Before that, we must first discuss

921
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,840
the ability of big data technology

922
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,120
to digitize

923
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,040
the world.

924
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,880
You know, all the known atoms of the universe

925
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,960
in the whole universe,

926
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
added together,

927
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
mathematically speaking,

928
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
is hard to support

929
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,960
this fantastical dream.

930
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,160
Quantum mechanics can be cited everywhere.

931
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,040
If uncertainty itself

932
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,200
is one of the basic laws

933
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,160
of the universe,

934
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,960
it's impossible itself.

935
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,720
So the ultimate threat

936
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,240
is that the whole world

937
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,120
being completely digitized

938
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,040
is impossible.

939
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,840
Let's come back to real life.

940
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,520
Are we able to combat

941
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
the pitfalls in big data?

942
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,240
After everyone's analysis,

943
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,680
I summed up the following points.

944
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,480
First,

945
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,840
personal privacy gradually disappears

946
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,680
and becomes

947
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,760
part of the commodity.

948
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,120
Two, if data is used in an illegal way,

949
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,560
or it falls into the wrong hands,

950
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,600
people will either suffer losses

951
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,080
or lose their freedoms.

952
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,000
Third,

953
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,000
the free market mechanism

954
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,200
combined with big data technology,

955
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,120
will spark a rise in oligopolies,

956
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,040
the social imbalance

957
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,560
in resource allocation

958
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,840
when niche needs are not met.

959
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,480
Transfer of privacy rights,

960
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,120
are major features

961
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,160
of the modern society.

962
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,880
I even think

963
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,800
this is not a singular problem.

964
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,040
The problem of illegal use

965
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,000
mainly involves

966
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,160
perfection of legal system construction

967
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,240
and prevention regulations.

968
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,920
There's a lot of progress.

969
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,680
Right.

970
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,760
Big data in terms of resource allocation

971
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,360
definitely has its own problems.

972
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,960
But this is precisely its strength too.

973
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,600
From this point of view,

974
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,920
The advantages really outweigh the disadvantages.

975
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,200
Do you realize that

976
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,480
after some thorough thinking,

977
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,000
all the threats

978
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,960
we perceive in fact

979
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,440
stem from

980
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,000
from our own worries?

981
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,440
That's right, the fear of losing control.

982
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,680
But every step in technological advancement

983
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,320
faces risk in losing control.

984
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,920
Control and breakthrough itself

985
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,560
is one of the themes of

986
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,240
promoting the world's civilization.

987
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,240
What remains unchanged is that

988
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,880
problems associated with development should be

989
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,200
dealt with by development.

990
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,360
Right?

991
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,720
Exactly.

992
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,960
Ouch.

993
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,680
Umm,

994
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,320
don't be nervous.

995
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,240
Treat it like a usual competition.

996
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,440
Take it easy.

997
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,520
That is my water.

998
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,840
Why don't you take it?

999
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Don't worry, Sa.

1000
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,160
Okay, come on.

1001
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,000
Is everyone ready?

1002
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,560
Ready.

1003
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,400
Let's go.
