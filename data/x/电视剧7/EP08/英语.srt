00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,720
Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP08

2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
And this one.

3
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,080
Bro

4
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,400
You rock!

5
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,880
You're just a freshman,

6
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
and you've completed

7
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
my ultimate goal

8
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,280
for all these four years in college.

9
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
It seems that I've achieved

10
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
my goals set up at the beginning of college.

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
Do you plan to

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,920
do anything else?

13
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,280
I haven't decided yet.

14
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
OK, take your time.

15
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,840
Let's play for a while.

16
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
Go, go, go.

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Let's go. Let's go.

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,600
I can't.

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
Hammer him!

20
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,000
Ma Nan

21
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
Why didn't you

22
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,880
attend school's job fair today?

23
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
Do you still have

24
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
any classes to retake this semester?

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,360
Ma Nan

26
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
I heard that you got six courses to retake

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,640
and didn't pass CET-4.

28
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
It would be difficult for you to graduate.

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,360
Maybe you can ask Li for help.

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
Anyhow, he thought highly of you.

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Do you still remember

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,200
what you looked like when you were a freshman?

33
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
What have you done in the past three years?

34
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,520
You dropped from the top to the bottom in grade.

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
Even meteorites

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,600
don't fall as fast as you.

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,960
Only a pure person,

38
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,360
completely pure,

39
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,480
with a firm will like the sun

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,440
and a burning heart like the volcano,

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,000
can not

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
be devoured by Ma Nan.

43
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,240
How could there be such a person?

44
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
Oh, students.

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
You're running, too.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,240
Ah.

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Being young is great.

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,880
Hey.

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,800
Don't be shy.

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,040
Let's have a running competition.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,080
I'll come after you.

52
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Hello, Ma Nan.

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,080
I'm...

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,200
Nan Bei told me about you.

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,400
The coach of

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,600
team two, right?

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,520
Sa

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,040
Just say what you want.

59
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,320
My name's Sa Jixue.

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,200
Alright,

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
then I'll get straight to the point.

62
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,560
OK.

63
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,920
The reason why I asked you to come here

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,960
is that I hope you can join

65
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,800
our school's debate team.

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,160
Team two.

67
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,360
No.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,680
Ma Nan, you have to believe

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,960
that I have a careful plan

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,800
for the future development

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,720
of team two.

72
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,720
In the future,

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
we will enter the provincial competition, beat the team one,

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,800
and reach the national peak.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,120
These are all just around the corner.

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,160
And when you graduate,

77
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
you will be able to be recommended as the best.

78
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
What a bright future!

79
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,080
OK.

80
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,880
And then?

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,480
Find a good job.

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,360
Just like you?

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
As long as you work hard,

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
you can achieve it.

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,120
So, what is a good job?

86
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,320
Mr. Sa, being a teacher in this school

87
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,240
at least

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,080
must be a graduate student, right?

89
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,760
After great efforts, you made it.

90
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,640
And then you encounter such a mess

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,440
like team two.

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,160
However, you can't reject it.

93
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,760
You still rely on it for promotion and salary increase.

94
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
Then you'll work harder.

95
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,800
After three to five years,

96
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
maybe you'll become the Secretary of the Youth League Committee.

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,720
And then you will be 30 years old at that time.

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,520
Is this what you called "a bright future"?

99
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Wait, wait.

100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

101
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,080
Maybe my words were

102
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,240
a little bit harsh.

103
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,000
Ma Nan,

104
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,480
let me tell you a story.

105
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,640
Go ahead.

106
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,000
On July 3,

107
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
1518,

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,760
in a medical family

109
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,480
in Qichun County,

110
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
Hubei Province,

111
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,480
a baby made his first cry of life.

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
His parents named him

113
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,360
Li Shizhen.

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
But, wait a minute.

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,840
Why are you telling me this?

116
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
Li Shizhen is a

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,880
medical scientist,

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,840
and a pharmaceutist.

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,880
He created a masterpiece

120
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,400
of 1.92 million words.

121
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,360
It's Compendium of Materia Medica.

122
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,200
He also wrote "An Examination of the Eight Extra Meridians",

123
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
and "A Study of the Pulse", etc.

124
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
But I've learned

125
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,600
all these things from my high school textbooks.

126
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
What can we learn

127
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
from his story?

128
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
He is a person

129
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,200
who will not be intimidated by difficulties

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,920
and will not be confused by success.

131
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,120
He worked tirelessly

132
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,800
towards his great goal.

133
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,440
So

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,080
he would not act rashly.

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,160
He moved forward steadily

136
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,440
and never retreated.

137
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,240
He is a person

138
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,400
who has reached a great level

139
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,960
but still maintains

140
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,320
his excellent characters.

141
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,640
How rare such a person is!

142
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,960
Though being outstanding

143
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,240
and virtuous,

144
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
he's modest at the same time,

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,920
so that

146
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,400
after more than 500 years later,

147
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,360
in modern world,

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,640
his Compendium of Materia Medica

149
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
is still of great significance.

150
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,120
But, but...

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
what are you trying to say?

152
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,520
Ma Nan,

153
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,200
Don't you think

154
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,760
such glorious deeds are stimulating?

155
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,680
Haven't you been touched

156
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,800
and inspired?

157
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,240
No.

158
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Mr. Sa, I have something else to do.

159
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,440
I'll go now.

160
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm not finished.

161
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,000
Ma Nan,

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
Would you like to hear the story of

163
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
Washington and the axe?

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,320
Didn't it inspire him?

165
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,120
It seems that I have to keep trying.

166
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,880
Ma Nan,

167
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,920
I will save you.

168
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,520
Oh, dear!

169
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Why are you again?

170
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:46,920
Yes.

171
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,720
It's me.

172
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,600
Ma Nan

173
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,240
Have you made your decision

174
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
about joining us?

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,240
No.

176
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
What's your purpose, anyway?

177
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,720
Let me tell you a story.

178
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,240
I won't listen.

179
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,480
I want to hear nothing about celebrity stories.

180
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,520
It's not a story of a celebrity.

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,360
What's that?

182
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,360
Do you know salmon?

183
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,920
Salmon?

184
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
Salmon is also called oncorhynchus keta.

185
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,400
It is

186
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,320
an incredible fish.

187
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,600
They live in

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,200
freshwater rivers and lakes,

189
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
but spend

190
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,120
most of their adult time

191
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
in the sea.

192
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Every time it comes to spawning,

193
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,560
they will migrate thousands of miles

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
to their hometowns

195
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,480
to produce their offspring,

196
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,960
and die

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,960
after spawning.

198
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
And the inheritance of life

199
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
lies in the cycle of

200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,840
migration,

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,840
generation

202
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,160
after generation.

203
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,040
But

204
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,280
what does this have to do with

205
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,040
whether I join the debate team or not?

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,880
Who

207
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
guides them

208
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
in the unseen world?

209
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,120
Despite the encirclement and interception

210
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,920
of big brown bears,

211
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
bald eagles, and humans,

212
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
they still go forward bravely

213
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,480
through thousands of difficulties

214
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
and dangers.

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,640
Don't you feel

216
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,480
the rhythm of life's beating?

217
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,880
Haven't you been touched

218
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,480
and inspired?

219
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,440
No, not at all.

220
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,120
Mr. Sa, I still have something else to do.

221
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,040
I need to go.

222
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
But I haven't finished yet.

223
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,160
Ma Nan

224
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,680
Don't you want to

225
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,600
hear the story of the Tibetan antelope

226
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,760
on the African savannah?

227
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,880
Ma Nan

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
Why are you again?

229
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,880
Ma Nan,

230
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,560
About joining our debate team...

231
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
I refuse, I refuse.

232
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,680
So,

233
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,560
let me tell you a story.

234
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
Oh, I don't want to listen to

235
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
the story of celebrity deeds,

236
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,320
nor animal world.

237
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't want to listen to that.

238
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,480
It's not a celebrity story,

239
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,560
nor is it the animal world.

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,960
So, what's that?

241
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,280
There is a galaxy

242
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,560
2.54 million

243
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,400
light years

244
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,920
away from the earth.

245
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,480
Zip it.

246
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,440
OK.

247
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll change another one.

248
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,680
Ma Nan

249
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,200
When did you come?

250
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,800
Since you started

251
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,640
playing the first round.

252
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
Then why are you as quiet as a mouse?

253
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,400
You scared me to death!

254
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,120
Because I saw you playing very attentively.

255
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,200
Well, of course,

256
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,800
I was also fascinated by it.

257
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,760
So,

258
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
I didn't want to interrupt you.

259
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

260
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,040
No, don't come over.

261
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,600
Stop it!

262
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
Ma Nan

263
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
Have you made your decision

264
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,240
about joining team two?

265
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,720
Stop it.

266
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,480
I won't join you.

267
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,720
All right.

268
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,880
Then let me tell you a story.

269
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,360
No, no, no.

270
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,200
I want to hear nothing

271
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,560
about celebrities

272
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,280
nor animal world.

273
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,160
In fact, I still have many other

274
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,560
exhilarating stories.

275
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,320
Ma Nan

276
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,000
Ma Nan, let your youth sparkling with brightness.

277
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
Man can't live twice.

278
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,640
Ma Nan

279
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,400
Yes.

280
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
What are you packing for?

281
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,200
My dad texted me

282
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
to go home.

283
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay.

284
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Sa said...

285
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,360
Don't mention

286
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,720
the word "Sa" to me.

287
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,960
Ma Nan

288
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
Ma Nan

289
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,920
Ma Nan...

290
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
Ma Nan

291
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,080
Where is he?

292
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,240
He has gone.

293
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,000
My son,

294
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,440
Why do you suddenly

295
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
run back home in such a hurry?

296
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,680
Nothing, I just want to have a look.

297
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,600
Now that you're back,

298
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,080
let's handle some affairs

299
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
early tomorrow morning.

300
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,200
Handle affairs?

301
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,360
What affairs?

302
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,480
You don't have to know.

303
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,680
Anyway, you'll know it tomorrow.

304
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,840
Uh

305
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
What's going on?

306
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,640
Buying a house.

307
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,360
Buying a house?

308
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,800
Ah?

309
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,360
But...

310
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,800
What's this for?

311
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,800
If you don't buy a house, how will you marry a wife?

312
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,680
But, but...

313
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,320
That's not what your dad meant.

314
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,400
We are trying to say

315
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,400
if you have a girlfriend

316
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
and want to marry her,

317
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,480
at that time

318
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,520
the house prices

319
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,080
will never be the same.

320
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,840
Yeah.

321
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,440
As soon as you went to college,

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
your mother and I began planning

323
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,400
to buy a house.

324
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,400
And now

325
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,480
the money is almost ready,

326
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,360
and you are about to graduate,

327
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,960
How nice!

328
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,360
Hey.

329
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,280
Nan

330
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,920
That's not what we meant.

331
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,320
We're not forcing you

332
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,640
to graduate right away.

333
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,880
I mean,

334
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,920
you've grown up.

335
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,120
You advocate freedom.

336
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,680
So, what kind of lifestyle

337
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,080
you want to choose in the future

338
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,240
is your freedom.

339
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Your father and I have no right to interfere.

340
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeah, yeah.

341
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,280
But it's also our freedom

342
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,120
to take care of you,

343
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,200
and you have no right to interfere.

344
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,200
Yes.

345
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,400
Look this.

346
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Look this house

347
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,280
with two rooms and two halls.

348
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,360
How big this hall is!

349
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,160
And look at the balcony.

350
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,960
If we seal it up,

351
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,560
we can make a small study.

352
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,520
Are you Ma Nan?

353
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,360
Please show me your ID card.

354
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,880
Why?

355
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,840
Wait a moment.

356
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,880
No problem.

357
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:08,960
Here,

358
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
please sign your name.

359
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,640
Go ahead.

360
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,400
Go ahead.

361
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,280
My son,

362
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,560
eat more.

363
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,400
You must be sick of

364
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,280
your school's dishes.

365
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:35,920
By the way,

366
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,440
This month's living expenses

367
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,400
have been transferred to you.

368
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,040
Thank you.

369
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,080
Never mind.

370
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,160
Wait,

371
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,360
we should celebrate first.

372
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Our son, Nan,

373
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,040
have a house now.

374
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,480
OK.

375
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,480
Shouldn't we? Yes, it's worth a celebration.

376
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,800
Come on, cheers!

377
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,440
Cheers!

378
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Don't drink to the last drop.

379
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,200
Can you drink less?

380
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,080
It's bad for your health.

381
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,120
Ah

382
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,040
Ma

383
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,720
That...

384
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,760
Should we change the water in the fishbowl?

385
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,360
You see, the fish are wilting.

386
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,960
Yes.

387
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,080
Do it when you're free.

388
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,680
I'll do it tomorrow.

389
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay.

390
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,520
We can't help but give in to the age.

391
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,240
Look at my face,

392
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,760
and my hair

393
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,560
is all white.

394
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
Yeah.

395
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,280
My eyesight is growing dim with age.

396
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,960
I can't see things clearly.

397
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,440
Exactly.

398
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,360
Here, the hair here is still white.

399
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,320
Haven't I told you to go to the barbershop to dye it?

400
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,440
You insist on dyeing it at home.

401
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,920
How inconvenient!

402
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,680
There's no big difference.

403
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,120
What are we wasting that money for?

404
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,040
Here.

405
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,440
Okay, okay.

406
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,360
You missed here.

407
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,280
Be patient.

408
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,560
Nan

409
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,760
Is the water in the fishbowl...

410
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,200
Gone?

411
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,000
There is a group of people

412
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,480
like us in the world.

413
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,880
We really don't know

414
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,920
what our dreams are.

415
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
And the evaluation

416
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,160
from the other side's position

417
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
labelled us with a concept

418
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,560
called mediocrity.

419
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,960
Of course, everyone has the freedom

420
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,480
to choose his own way of life,

421
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,600
but

422
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,360
that should be on the premise of

423
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,840
not depriving others

424
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,600
of their right to choose.

425
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,040
Hello, Nan Bei.

426
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,480
Where were you last night?

427
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,280
I telephoned, and you didn't answer.

428
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,680
I came back home.

429
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,440
Do me a favor, please.

430
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,440
What?

431
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,080
In my drawer,

432
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,160
the third drawer,

433
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
there's a student card.

434
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,680
Check out my student card number,

435
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,440
and help me sign up for the CET-4.

436
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,880
No problem.

437
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,800
And

438
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,120
is there still a vacancy in your team?

439
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,160
Come on!

440
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,480
Let me lead you to beat team one.

441
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,640
Package 7301,

442
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,440
is this yours?

443
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,040
No?

444
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,320
Excuse me.

445
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,840
I'm here to ask you,

446
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
have I signed up for that exam?

447
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,160
Yes.

448
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,320
And?

449
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,880
And

450
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
I've made up my mind.

451
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,640
I'll be your fourth debater.

452
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,840
Next is the most exciting

453
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,760
"free debate" part

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,160
that you are looking forward to.

455
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,320
Now, let's invite

456
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,360
debaters from both sides.

457
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,880
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

458
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
Let me confirm our consensus

459
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,760
on "comfort zone".

460
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,520
It is an environment that allows

461
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,600
young people to be more comfortable

462
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
and give full play to their value,

463
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,240
right?

464
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
What is "more comfortable"?

465
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,560
More comfortable than what?

466
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,480
What value to play?

467
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,360
And give full play to whose value?

468
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,480
Um.

469
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
Being more comfortable means that

470
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
it is more comfortable

471
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,240
than being uncomfortable.

472
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,120
In terms of the value,

473
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,520
It means that the environment

474
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,160
can help him realize his self-value.

475
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,120
The comfort zone of boomerang kids

476
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
is relying on parents.

477
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,240
So, what value do they create?

478
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,000
His value is

479
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,120
to accompany his parents.

480
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,920
Keeping a dog

481
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,600
can also keep you company.

482
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,680
Is this the value

483
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,480
it creates?

484
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,960
No, this is its born value.

485
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,480
Therefore, your explanation

486
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
of realizing value

487
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,040
is somewhat farfetched.

488
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,600
Your view is to jump out of the comfort zone,

489
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,920
but if the comfort zone is very comfortable,

490
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,160
why should we jump out?

491
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,040
Lying down is comfortable,

492
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,200
why should I sit up?

493
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
This chair is very comfortable,

494
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
then why should I stand up?

495
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,200
Because only when I stand up and speak,

496
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,880
can I get applause

497
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,040
from the audience. Right?

498
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,440
Just now our second debater

499
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,560
also stood up,

500
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,520
and then he stuttered.

501
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,880
Therefore, standing up bravely

502
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,960
may gain applause

503
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,280
or embarrassment,

504
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,120
but sitting there will never be embarrassed.

505
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,160
It would be deeply embarrassing

506
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,880
when none of you

507
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,640
stood up.

508
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,520
My fellow debaters, let's get straight to the point.

509
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,360
Are you suffering

510
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,240
when you jump out of your comfort zone?

511
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,800
Is discomfort equal to suffering?

512
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,920
Isn't it?

513
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,400
I'm exhausted when I go to the gym.

514
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,360
It must be uncomfortable.

515
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,280
But when I got sweaty,

516
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,880
it is great fun for me.

517
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Is it a suffering?

518
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,440
I feel comfortable when working out.

519
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,000
This is comfortable to you.

520
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,600
That is comfortable to you.

521
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,160
All in all,

522
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
You are comfortable to everything

523
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,000
as long as it is conducive to your team.

524
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,680
We are

525
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,040
very uncomfortable with this.

526
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,520
They are addictive to

527
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,840
playing petty tricks.

528
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,520
We're not the first one to do this.

529
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,080
They can only blame themselves.

530
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,800
Well.

531
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,760
Let's set aside the snarky answers,

532
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,080
and turn to something practical.

533
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,560
There are many century-old stores in Japan.

534
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,880
They developed deeply

535
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,080
within their comfort zone.

536
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,080
Although they didn't jump out of the zone,

537
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,360
they still adapt well to the world.

538
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:43,840
Right?

539
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,000
What's the specific number of these stores?

540
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,360
Hundreds or thousands?

541
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
What is their proportion

542
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,440
in Japanese history?

543
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,120
One thousandth

544
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,920
or one ten-thousandth?

545
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,880
So why don't you mention

546
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,840
most of the them?

547
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,600
Regardless of data,

548
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,200
this example at least shows

549
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
that even if I don't jump out of the comfort zone,

550
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,320
as long as I focus on my own business,

551
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,520
I won't be eliminated.

552
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,920
Nokia, a former mobile phone giant,

553
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
has focused on implementing

554
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,520
"technology based on shell changing"

555
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
to make the function machine.

556
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,440
Please tell me,

557
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,080
what is its current

558
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,760
mobile phone market share?

559
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,440
Let's push the time earlier.

560
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,320
GINZA Sushiko in Tokyo

561
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,840
has been making sushi for 120 years.

562
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,920
Isn't it doing well

563
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,160
in its comfort zone?

564
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,480
Yamaha acting willfully.

565
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,640
Nintendo changing its profession.

566
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,880
Michelin running irrelevant business relentlessly.

567
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Which of these similar century old stores

568
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,200
is not world-famous

569
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,160
after jumping out of

570
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,240
their comfort zone?

571
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,640
However, I know nothing about

572
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,120
the sushi restaurant you just mentioned.

573
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,640
Yamaha didn't give up on

574
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,600
the practice of repairing pianos while building ships.

575
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,360
Michelin didn't delay making tires

576
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
when it wrote food guides.

577
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,600
They didn't jump out of the comfort circle,

578
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,440
but constantly expanded the boundary

579
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,880
of their comfort zone.

580
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,840
Isn't this

581
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,880
a better choice?

582
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,280
The expansion of Michelin and Yamaha

583
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,680
is based on their century old foundation,

584
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,760
but most of the young people

585
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
we are talking about today

586
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,720
only have

587
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,760
some years of hard study.

588
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,920
Our comfort zone

589
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,400
is just a foothold under our feet.

590
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,200
My fellow debaters,

591
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,520
how nostalgic are you

592
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,720
that you won't jump out of your comfort zone?

593
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,240
But, my fellow debaters,

594
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,240
don't I have the right

595
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,840
to stay in my comfort zone?

596
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,720
Do all young people

597
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,520
have to be constrained by the pep talk

598
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,840
like "never give up"?

599
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,440
Can't I stay in my comfort zone

600
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,400
and enjoy a tranquil and comfortable life?

601
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,320
Isn't that feasible?

602
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,400
Of course, you can, but...

603
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,880
We are hopeful!

604
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,840
Thanks to the fourth debater from Team NEG's

605
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,720
wonderful speech.

606
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,400
Now, let's move on to

607
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,360
the final summary of the Team AFF.

608
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,600
Let's welcome the fourth debater from Team AFF.

609
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank you.

610
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,600
You just asked us

611
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
if we have the right

612
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,360
not to jump out of the comfort zone.

613
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,080
Of course, we do.

614
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,400
In the face of life and death,

615
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,280
we have the right

616
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,360
to choose to live.

617
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
In the face of interests,

618
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,400
we have the right

619
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
to pursue advantages.

620
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,440
However, why do people with lofty ideals in ancient and modern times

621
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,280
are concerned about the society all the time?

622
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,960
Because in addition to our rights,

623
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,440
we also have responsibilities,

624
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,120
duties,

625
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,280
and future.

626
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,840
What is a comfort zone

627
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,520
for young people?

628
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,960
Today, you've used

629
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,880
a lot of words and phrases

630
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,440
to try to

631
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,840
delineate the scope of the comfort zone.

632
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't this is necessary.

633
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
What is exactly a comfortable zone?

634
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,560
A job

635
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,360
that is not too bad.

636
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,160
A place

637
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,960
that is not too awful.

638
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
A living environment

639
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,840
that is not too terrible.

640
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,160
Maybe you can define the comfort zone

641
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,880
as "not bad",

642
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,600
but when you want to change your major

643
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,120
and want to change your job,

644
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,840
you will be extremely frustrated.

645
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,640
Because you already

646
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,200
have your corner that is not too bad.

647
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,120
Would it be better to

648
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,440
change a major or a job?

649
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,240
I don't know.

650
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,960
But jumping out of this zone

651
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,280
makes better possible.

652
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,400
At this time,

653
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,080
the comfort zone that is not too bad

654
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,320
will become

655
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,880
a mental shackle that will limit you.

656
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,040
So, we believe that

657
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,920
the nature of the comfort zone

658
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,440
is by no means "not too bad".

659
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,760
It is a habit,

660
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,440
a life inertia.

661
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,360
And inertia

662
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,000
is a

663
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,480
huge

664
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,280
and fearful power.

665
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,920
The more comfortable you are

666
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,760
in your comfort zone,

667
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,640
the more you are used to

668
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,040
controlling everything there.

669
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,200
Once you get used to it,

670
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,080
who on earth

671
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,880
controls who?

672
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,840
Some people questioned that

673
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,880
isn't it cool to truant?

674
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,840
Isn't it cool to be

675
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,480
the top dog among freshmen

676
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,880
who always ask you for information?

677
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,400
You don't need to face the cruelty of society,

678
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,840
but you don't have the ability to make money to support the family.

679
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,000
But so what?

680
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
However, once you indulge yourself

681
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,080
in that small world,

682
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,360
is the school

683
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,480
your comfort zone

684
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,360
or a nursing home?

685
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,720
When we turn habits into pursuits,

686
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
when we indulge ourselves

687
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,920
in the arcadia,

688
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
and when we get used to

689
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,440
all our habits,

690
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,560
even if one day you realize

691
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,160
that your comfort zone

692
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,600
is a "The Truman Show",

693
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,040
you've already got used to

694
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
the narrow sky in the cave,

695
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
and how can you face

696
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,520
the world's unmeasured vastness.

697
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:44,880
Thank you.

698
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,000
The result of this game

699
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,240
is now in my hands.

700
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,520
I declare that

701
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,560
the winner of this debate

702
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,920
is the Team AFF.

703
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,880
The debate team from DUFE.

704
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,120
Hello, dad.

705
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:47,840
Hi.

706
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,360
Nan

707
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
What's your

708
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,400
bank account number?

709
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,480
It's Okay.

710
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,440
I'll go back home

711
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,640
and have dinner with you this weekend.

712
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,000
I haven't been back for a long time.

713
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,720
Alright.

714
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,400
So, you don't have to remit money to me.

715
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,280
By the way, I'm working part-time now.

716
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,080
I have money.

717
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,760
But

718
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,880
you have to deposit

719
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,920
6,000 yuan a month

720
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,760
in your bank account.

721
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
You have to pay the mortgage

722
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,720
at the end of each month.

723
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,280
Cheer up!

724
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,280
Our topic today

725
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,880
is to retrospect our last game.

726
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,120
Although we

727
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,840
won the game,

728
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,560
we

729
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,400
still exposed

730
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,160
a lot of problems.

731
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,880
So, today we'll look for problems.

732
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,800
Who says first?

733
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,680
Actually,

734
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,000
everyone did very well this time.

735
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,800
Dango

736
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,040
Thank you, Hao.

737
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,320
Does anyone want to summarize?

738
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,640
Nan Bei, you act shamelessly.

739
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,640
I'll buy you fried chicken after the retrospection.

740
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
I, I, I, I think

741
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,040
the biggest hero of this competition

742
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,240
should be Mu Xiaoyu student.

743
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,680
She is absolutely the best.

744
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,400
Oho,

745
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,760
you have also shown admirable behavior.

746
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,600
However, our great hero

747
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
is still our first debater,

748
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,400
sister Tao Hao.

749
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,280
Your speech

750
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,720
paved the way for our victory.

751
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,600
Don't say that.

752
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,320
It's mainly because

753
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,400
our fourth debater,

754
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,200
comrade Ma Nan.

755
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,600
Me?

756
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,560
How about me?

757
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,680
Dango

758
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,240
As the leader

759
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,040
of the logistics team

760
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,880
and the

761
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,040
cheering team,

762
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,840
Your performance

763
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,400
is perfect!

764
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
You shocked the cheerleaders

765
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,840
from the opposite team into silence.

766
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,320
Really?

767
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,880
Yes.

768
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,640
Enough.

769
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,960
Stop it.

770
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,760
Stop

771
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,160
this round of business flattery.

772
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,760
Our topic today

773
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,160
is to find problems.

774
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,040
How can there be so many problems?

775
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,120
Coach Sa

776
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,840
Can we stop

777
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,000
being so picky?

778
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Treat you guys to hot pot this evening.

779
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,480
I think there are no big problems,

780
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,320
but there still lies some small problems.

781
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,200
Someone among us

782
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,840
got trapped

783
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,920
but got away in time, luckily.

784
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,400
Yes.

785
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,120
Who are you blaming here?

786
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,080
Who was trapped

787
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,960
by the other party's

788
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,440
logic setting,

789
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,320
Nan Bei?

790
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,920
Me, it's me.

791
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,200
It's mainly my problem.

792
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,840
My argument is not perfect enough.

793
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,240
Hao.

794
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,080
It has nothing to do with you.

795
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
It's Ma.

796
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,160
What the hell

797
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,920
is his speech?

798
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,600
No ,no, no.

799
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
The main reason is that

800
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,280
my framework is not perfect enough,

801
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,440
which makes the Team NEG take some advantages.

802
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,000
OK, I forgive you.

803
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Well,

804
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,800
You've been debating for so many years.

805
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,760
Is this your ideological level?

806
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,280
How can you

807
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,400
shirk your responsibilities like this?

808
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,800
All right.

809
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,120
Let me do the summary.

810
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,440
Now,

811
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,280
I will

812
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,800
make the retrospection to you.

813
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,920
The biggest problem of team two

814
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,360
is that the second debater is too weak.

815
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,440
Why are you everywhere?

816
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,880
The biggest problem with your team

817
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,160
is that problems are everywhere.

818
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,760
Oh, wait.

819
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,480
Calm down, calm down.

820
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,080
We are all school teams

821
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,280
and we should help each other.

822
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,680
We've established rules

823
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,200
on the usage of this classroom.

824
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,360
This classroom is for us after eight o'clock.

825
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,400
Is it time up? Is it time up?

826
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,840
Not yet...

827
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:44,960
You.

828
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,400
Enough.

829
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,040
Students,

830
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,520
We're all school teams.

831
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,920
There's no need to

832
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,160
contrast sharply as soon as we meet.

833
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,360
There is always a way

834
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,440
to get what we need.

835
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,680
Take what we need. That's right.

836
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,560
So, now

837
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,160
we need to use this classroom.

838
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,680
Yin Nan

839
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,240
Calm down.

840
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,040
Let me handle this.

841
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,960
There!

842
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,640
Isn't the air pure and fresh here?

843
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,360
The air quality in the classroom is bad.

844
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,280
And it will affect our thinking.

845
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,640
Well.

846
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,440
God bless the person with a strong will.

847
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,560
Think positively.

848
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,880
I'll go on retrospecting.

849
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,000
Each of you

850
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,160
had some problems

851
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,960
in the last game.

852
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,560
No one can run away from this.

853
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
To sum up, there are four points.

854
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,520
Stiff, stubborn, showy, and soft.

855
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,400
Tao Hao, you are too stiff.

856
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,320
Tao Hao, your argument is

857
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,960
very excellent.

858
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,800
You have done a very good job

859
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,120
in both argument setting

860
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,400
and definition differentiating.

861
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,240
When related problems arose,

862
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,800
you would always appear

863
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,080
at once.

864
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,840
But

865
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,680
when other problems came out,

866
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,760
I couldn't see you at all.

867
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,320
Your label of the first debater

868
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,720
is so obvious

869
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
that your opponent can guess clearly

870
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,320
when you appear

871
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,640
and when you don't appear.

872
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,520
In the end,

873
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,240
you won't have

874
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,480
any room to show yourself.

875
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,800
You're too stiff.

876
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,000
Do you understand?

877
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,560
"Stubborn" is for Nan Bei.

878
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,240
Ah?

879
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,960
Nan, your responsibility is to defend,

880
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,520
and you've done it well, too.

881
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,680
But I didn't ask you to hide yourself all the time

882
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,640
and not to attack their palace.

883
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,640
Attack it when needed.

884
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,240
Okay?

885
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,120
I won't go into the palace.

886
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,560
Go in it if you want to,

887
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,800
and serve imperial concubine.

888
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,280
I won't do it.

889
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,040
Use all your jokes

890
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,080
on attacking.

891
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
Compared with the "stubborn" of Nan Bei,

892
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,440
you're too showy, Yu.

893
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
You mean, outstanding?

894
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,880
No.

895
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,760
Let's look at the game records.

896
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,320
You alone took 25

897
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,680
of all 33 attacks.

898
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,160
As long as there was an opportunity to attack,

899
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,000
you would seize it with all your efforts.

900
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,080
But you forgot to consider

901
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
whether your attack

902
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
can help with our main logic or not.

903
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,240
So,

904
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,040
of your 25 attacks,

905
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,920
only ten

906
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,160
made the argument stronger.

907
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,160
The rest

908
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,440
are all snarky answers.

909
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,200
Some people knew it was a debate,

910
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,040
while others

911
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,920
would think you were performing a comic dialogue.

912
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,280
Don't be so showy next time.

913
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,200
Oh.

914
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,200
Dango

915
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,920
You're good!

916
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,720
At last, I'll comment on Ma Nan.

917
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,560
Ma Nan's conclusion

918
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,280
is excellent.

919
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,800
Very excellent.

920
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,480
But

921
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,040
at least say something

922
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,080
apart from your conclusion.

923
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,520
Isn't it a bit wasteful

924
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
not to make up for deficiencies

925
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
with your ability?

926
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,160
You're too soft.

927
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,080
No bad, Sa.

928
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,440
Coach Sa.

929
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
Coach Sa, how can you hide your light under a bushel?

930
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,240
Alright,

931
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,160
these are all your problems.

932
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,320
The next game

933
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,160
is very important for us.

934
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,720
And it's getting closer.

935
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,680
Let's have a meeting tomorrow morning

936
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,720
to formulate tactics.

937
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,560
That's all for today

938
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,680
for I have to talk to the old coach.

939
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,120
Hey, wait a minute.

940
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,600
What about hot pot and fried chicken?

941
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,080
The meeting ended!

942
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,760
Coach, you took your cell phone upside down.

943
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,320
Coach, you took your cell phone upside down.

944
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,720
Do you still cough?

945
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,640
You took your cell phone upside down.

946
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,200
Then I'll go first.

947
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,920
Hao

948
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,000
Don't go

949
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,040
if your stomach doesn't feel well.

950
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,240
It's much better.

951
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,000
And I have an appointment with my boyfriend.

952
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,080
You can see him some other day.

953
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,240
We have an appointment,

954
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,240
and he's already waiting for me.

955
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,920
Yu, you don't understand.

956
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,880
The power of love

957
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,480
can cure everything.

958
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,920
I must go.

959
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,760
Bye.

960
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,440
She looks

961
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,360
very tired recently.

962
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,680
I'm worried about her health.

963
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,400
There are many things to cope with

964
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,520
in the student union.

965
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,800
And recently, she started her internship in a company.

966
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,200
Yeah, I've heard about it.

967
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,920
Employees in the department

968
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,400
where she interned are almost retiring.

969
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:22,920
Because

970
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,800
she did everything.

971
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,080
I'm afraid she can't hold on.

972
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,480
What are you doing here?

973
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,120
I'm just hanging around.

974
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,360
Since you've done the usage of this classroom,

975
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,600
I should be able to come in.

976
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,760
I told you

977
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,160
not to bring me desserts.

978
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,600
Oh.

979
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,520
This is

980
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,040
for me.

981
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,640
Oh.

982
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,480
Please go on.

983
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,480
Golden color.

984
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,240
Crisp sound.

985
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
Thick milky flavor.

986
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,960
How creamy and sweet!

987
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,840
Senior

988
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,000
Ah?

989
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,040
Are you all right?

990
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,720
I saw you've been in a daze.

991
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh.

992
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,800
I'm all right.

993
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,640
Would you like one?

994
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,240
Can I?

995
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,280
Of course.

996
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,840
Excuse me.

997
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,880
What shall we have for lunch?

998
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,640
Whatever you decide.

999
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,960
Hand-pulled noodles?

1000
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,360
What about hot pot?

1001
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,640
Oh, you have an upset stomach.

1002
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Let's have hand-pulled noodles.

1003
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,320
As soon as you say hot pot,

1004
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,640
I suddenly want to eat it, too.

1005
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,360
Let's have hot pot.

1006
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,800
Can you do that?

1007
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,040
You don't have to accommodate yourself to me every time.

1008
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,400
I didn't.

1009
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,480
I really want to eat it.

1010
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,360
It just comes into my head suddenly.

1011
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,000
We can go to a tea restaurant.

1012
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Just take it as going there in company of me.

1013
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,640
Are you sure?

1014
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,680
Don't worry, I'm fine.

1015
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,480
Why does Hao have stomachache again?

1016
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,560
Nan Bei, shall we deliver the medicine

1017
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,400
to her home now?

1018
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,360
She is out on a date,

1019
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,640
how can she come back so fast?

1020
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,760
Her boyfriend's a little bit tactless.

1021
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,320
Hao's not feeling well.

1022
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,600
Why not rest in the dormitory

1023
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,800
but go on a date?

1024
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,360
Don't you know Hao?

1025
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
She always accommodates others

1026
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,640
with no exception.

1027
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,320
If others accommodate her once,

1028
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,160
she will suffer for several days.

1029
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,200
What do you mean "others"?

1030
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,400
Aren't they lovers?

1031
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,720
It's not a big deal for a man

1032
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,440
to yield to his girlfriend.

1033
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,760
Hey.

1034
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,120
There is a milk tea shop there.

1035
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,440
Do you want to have a drink or not?

1036
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,240
I am a little full.

1037
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,960
It's my treat.

1038
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,800
I'll have a venti.

1039
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,360
38 yuan per cup.

1040
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,560
So expensive. But why there are still so many people lining up?

1041
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,640
We have a promotion today.

1042
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,600
Lovers buy one can get extra one for free.

1043
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,160
Baby, it's nice to have you.

1044
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Thank you.

1045
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,040
Can we separate?

1046
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,520
Don't worry.

1047
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,040
We're not out of their sight yet.

1048
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,120
What taste is this?

1049
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,520
What's your taste?

1050
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
I don't know. Maybe pineapple.

1051
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,840
Let me have a taste.

1052
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,920
Did we take the wrong one?

1053
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,680
Isn't it all clearly written here?

1054
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,720
Really?

1055
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,800
Can we separate now?

1056
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,240
Maybe.

1057
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,640
Get away from me.

1058
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,920
Where's my dinner card?

1059
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,080
You're always forgetful.

1060
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,200
Stop lecturing me, please.

1061
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,360
I tell you

1062
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,960
they are very funny.

1063
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,160
Am I so famous

1064
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,240
in the debate team

1065
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,240
that they recognize me?

1066
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,440
That's her.

1067
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,640
Today must be the day

1068
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,200
that we gain worldwide fame.

1069
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,840
Let's keep training.

1070
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,480
Come on!

1071
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,320
Our team is going to train.

1072
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,040
Please leave.

1073
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,240
What are

1074
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,120
your two eyes for?

1075
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,680
Can't you see the time?

1076
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,440
We have a competition tomorrow,

1077
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,640
which is very important,

1078
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
so we need to use this classroom now.

1079
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,280
We've agreed that

1080
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,640
this room is used by us before 8 o'clock.

1081
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,520
All interpretation rights

1082
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,400
belong to team one.

1083
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Calm down.

1084
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,320
Let me handle this.

1085
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,960
Kids

1086
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
After we come out and

1087
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,360
breathe in the fragrance of nature,

1088
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,280
do you feel more comfortable?

1089
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,720
What happened to you guys?

1090
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,240
What wusses are we to leave there?

1091
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,800
Exactly.

1092
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,120
It's not like we can't beat them.

1093
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,280
Maybe we'll have a chance

1094
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,120
to talk to the old coach.

1095
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,800
Right.

1096
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,720
Can't you

1097
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,560
hold on for a while?

1098
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:49,960
Sa

1099
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,840
At least we wait until Liu Yanze comes.

1100
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,080
Everybody,

1101
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,040
don't be so tit-for-tat.

1102
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,280
After all, we are all school teams.

1103
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,120
This is not conducive to the construction

1104
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,680
of both teams.

1105
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,320
Look,

1106
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,160
Hao has a higher ideological consciousness.

1107
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,520
We must not

1108
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
be disturbed

1109
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,840
by these

1110
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,520
external factors.

1111
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,200
Our top priority now

1112
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,920
is to win the next game.

1113
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,520
As long as we win this game,

1114
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,560
we have the right to voice our opinions.

1115
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,800
In the next game,

1116
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,200
we'll have to face

1117
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,080
the legendary Fulin College

1118
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,760
who is always performing well.

1119
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,040
This team is very crazy

1120
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,160
and unpredictable.

1121
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,120
But they signed up for such a

1122
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,000
inferior competition,

1123
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,560
Qiyi Cup College Students Debate Tournament,

1124
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,720
which is expected by no one.

1125
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,520
I bet

1126
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,640
they slipped their hands when they signed up.

1127
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,520
Yes.

1128
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,640
I will venture one yuan on it.

1129
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,720
I'll venture 1.5 yuan.

1130
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:35,760
Well.

1131
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,040
Let's take a look at

1132
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,400
their lineup.

1133
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,440
Wang Wenjing, the first debater,

1134
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,160
is called a live history book.

1135
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,040
She has a clear logic,

1136
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,520
and is very good at using historical evidences.

1137
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,160
She knows everything from poetry

1138
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,320
to worldly wisdom.

1139
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,960
Her hobby is drilling wood to make fire,

1140
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,760
and has won the Best Environmental Protection Award.

1141
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,640
Wow.

1142
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,920
She's so unique!

1143
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,760
Zhao Chengong, the second debater.

1144
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,920
he is best at using a straw man argument

1145
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,680
and making fast attacks,

1146
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,640
which always makes his opponents defenseless.

1147
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,600
He often misleads his opponents

1148
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,280
until they don't know

1149
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,960
what they're talking about.

1150
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,840
Ge Lin, the third debater.

1151
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,760
He is the school beau and good learner of Fulin college,

1152
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,360
and is best at finding subtle loopholes

1153
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,440
between attack and defense.

1154
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,040
One Shot, One Kill.

1155
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,880
He is known as

1156
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,120
the direct disciple known as Socrates.

1157
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,840
Not bad.

1158
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,400
But

1159
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,200
he's still far behind him.

1160
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,280
I boycott school beau.

1161
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,760
I boycott him

1162
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,840
with no reason.

1163
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,640
Gong Huaqing, the fourth debater.

1164
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,160
She has a wealth of knowledge

1165
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,080
and her arguments have a sense of substitution

1166
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,360
and are easy to resonate.

1167
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,920
She is the main figure in the sentimental school.

1168
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,600
Let's have a look.

1169
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,360
As my fellow debater said,

1170
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,920
when the means

1171
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,880
are transformed to the purpose,

1172
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,840
humans will be reduced

1173
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,320
from masters to slaves.

1174
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,720
They talk so fast.

1175
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,640
When we finish our words,

1176
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,880
they are almost going to the award stage.

1177
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:45,920
So,

1178
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,760
it's very important to increase our speed of speaking.

1179
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,920
And this is our goal for the next stage.

1180
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,480
Improve our ability of oral expression.

1181
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,960
Practicing language

1182
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,680
has long been outdated.

1183
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,760
Now we all pursue

1184
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,920
the quality of the content, OK?

1185
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,520
That's just one thought.

1186
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,480
Actually,

1187
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,280
I think this is very meaningful.

1188
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,400
Debate is not just

1189
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
a test of logic and knowledge.

1190
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,280
If your expression level

1191
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,320
is the same as

1192
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,600
the top host's,

1193
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,880
isn't it pleasing to the audience's ears?

1194
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,360
Don't you think so?

1195
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,360
A nice point.

1196
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,160
And some small training

1197
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,080
can be done when you chat, quarrel,

1198
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,120
sing Karaoke, practice rap music,

1199
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,800
and even go to the bathroom.

1200
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,560
You can practice it everywhere.

1201
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,840
A famous professor

1202
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
of the Line major

1203
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,800
at the drama college

1204
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
once told us that

1205
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,560
lines are practiced in life.

1206
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,960
So, we should integrate line practice into life.

1207
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,760
Okay, let's stop here.

1208
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,920
Go into action, everybody.

1209
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,640
What do you want?

1210
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,280
Come here, come here.

1211
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,440
Sit down.

1212
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,520
What's wrong?

1213
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,280
When did you start?

1214
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,960
What's going on?

1215
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,840
What?

1216
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,080
I don't know...  Yu, Yu, Yu.

1217
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,560
The photos of you and Nan Bei have been exposed.

1218
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,000
What photos do we have?

1219
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,560
Look!

1220
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,840
Is this a photo of you and Nan Bei?

1221
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,600
It updates every day.
