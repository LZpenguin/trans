00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,520
Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP05

2
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,520
Hey.

3
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,280
You are new here?

4
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Hello, senior.

5
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,360
The two campuses of the Western University of Science and Technology

6
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
merged

7
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,200
and our classes were

8
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,120
all arranged in the east side

9
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,840
so we were

10
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
arranged to live here.

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,680
Fine.

12
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,880
This dormitory has exactly

13
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,800
three empty beds.

14
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,240
We should take care of each other from now on.

15
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,080
Hello.

16
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,480
Is this room 227?

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,160
Do you live here too?

18
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,200
Yeah.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,600
Where do I live then?

20
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,800
Sa

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,360
Yeah.

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,120
You don't have to be nervous.

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,840
I know these kids

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,280
too well.

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,000
When they came to see me for the first time

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,600
they looked

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,200
so calm

28
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,680
as if nothing had happened.

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,680
I knew in my heart

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,360
they were not convinced

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,160
that they had lost.

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,160
I'll do it.

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Thank you.

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,920
Coach

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
It's my turn.

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,000
OK, hurry up.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Come on.

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,480
Checkmate.

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,560
This doesn't count. My piece hasn't fallen yet.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,600
This doesn't count.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,800
Look

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,320
there's room for maneuver

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,440
in everything.

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,360
It's the same

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,680
with these kids.

46
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
They have this enthusiasm in their hearts

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,600
but

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,920
you can't deny

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,840
the fact that

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,000
they like debating.

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,760
Yeah.

52
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,920
Right.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,600
But from team one to the team two

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,800
I can imagine

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,440
the looks on their faces.

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,480
You have to believe in yourself

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,640
and more importantly, in your students.

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,960
Right?

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,520
Hum.

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Checkmate.

61
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,760
It's a surprise.

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,640
Did you hear that?

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
This afternoon

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
the nursing department will take free blood pressure tests

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,200
in front of the dining hall.

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,560
Oh.

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,440
Nan Bei

68
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,520
Don't say I'm not a true friend.

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
It's hard to get a ticket

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,720
for each test.

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,880
This time one of my friends

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,560
reserved a place for me.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,480
I have no time.

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,080
My blood pressure is steady, a straight line.

75
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,480
Come on.

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,040
How about we go out and exercise?

77
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,640
Rest breeds rust.

78
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,080
Basketball, football, and table tennis...

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,920
No. Tennis.

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,120
Hello.

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,560
You are here

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,600
to sell the cart?

83
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,920
Such a coincidence.

84
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,240
My

85
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,080
dormitory is occupied by freshmen

86
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,840
of the Western University of Science and Technology.

87
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,240
The school has arranged for me

88
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,520
to live with you guys from now on.

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
Do you know each other?

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,680
Ma Nan

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,280
A buddy in the fifth year of college.

92
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,240
The fifth year...

93
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,520
It's all fate.

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,760
Just welcome me casually.

95
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
No need to be too grand.

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
Let's go and play tennis.

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,160
let's go.

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,760
Come on. Rest breeds rust.

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,400
Come on.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,280
Fine.

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,120
First look at my movements.

102
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
Pay attention to the actions.

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,800
One.

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,160
Two.

105
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,560
Three.

106
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,920
Everyone practices

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,000
in groups of two.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,520
Nan Bei

109
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,280
I don't know

110
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,160
whether to tell you or not.

111
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,240
Please.

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,880
I'm almost burned.

113
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,640
Well.

114
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,720
The three of us don't know how to play tennis

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,880
so what are we doing here?

116
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,800
Why don't we

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,040
play basketball for a while?

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's fight with them.

119
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,000
So you are

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
destined to be lonely forever.

121
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
A group of sweaty muscular men

122
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,280
on the basketball court.

123
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,880
How can there be

124
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
a beautiful landscape like this?

125
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,480
Come on, posture ready.

126
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,000
One.

127
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,840
Two.

128
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,160
Three.

129
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
Good. Danger cleared.

130
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,440
It's fine.

131
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm not doing this.

132
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm going to play basketball.

133
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm going to play basketball.

134
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm...

135
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,080
Hey.

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
What?

137
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,520
What are you doing?

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,560
Nothing.

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,920
Okay, class

140
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
that's all for today.

141
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,920
Lin

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,040
Do you have something

143
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,160
to tell your classmates?

144
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,120
I have a notice

145
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,920
to all sophomore students.

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,160
Next Friday at 2:30 p.m.

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,440
there will be the physical test for men 1,000 meters

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,000
women 800 meters.

149
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,240
Don't forget and please be on time.

150
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,040
Okay, class's over.

151
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,520
Let's go out to eat.

152
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,920
Well.

153
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,760
I'm not going. I don't have the appetite.

154
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm going back to the dormitory.

155
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,040
Ah?

156
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
I'm going back to the dormitory.

157
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,240
Dude

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm going to the tennis court

159
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,400
to run

160
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,240
and practice.

161
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,080
Let's go together.

162
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,000
We have a football field.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Why you have to go to the tennis court?

164
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,920
Are you doing it for that girl?

165
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,960
Let's go.

166
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Have you figured it out?

167
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Do you want to go to team two?

168
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,560
No.

169
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,440
Don't want to be their backup.

170
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,200
If Yin Nan asked me

171
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,040
to copy an argument for her,

172
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,200
would I take two copies

173
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
or smear it for her?

174
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,400
If I were you

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,320
I'd just smash it.

176
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,400
Did you really get the answer?

177
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,040
Yeah.

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,640
When I first joined the school team

179
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,760
in my freshman year

180
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,080
I thought

181
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,560
I was really good at debating.

182
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,400
However, through this competition

183
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
I finally understood one thing.

184
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,800
What's that?

185
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,880
People

186
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,400
should not force themselves.

187
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,640
Yin Nan's talent

188
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,400
is higher than me

189
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,920
and her debate is better than me.

190
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,920
Why do I have to

191
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,080
look for trouble?

192
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,720
Right?

193
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,640
I just can't beat her now

194
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,800
but sooner or later

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,680
there will be someone

196
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
who is better than her

197
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,240
and teach her a lesson

198
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,200
in the debate.

199
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,960
Don't be so modest.

200
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I think

201
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,640
you are better than her

202
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,280
in many points.

203
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
For example?

204
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,000
For example...

205
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,440
For example, you are her junior.

206
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,880
Your theory is younger than hers.

207
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,320
But to be honest

208
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,480
I really

209
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:34,960
have no confidence

210
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,160
in debate anymore.

211
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,520
Even if I were in team two

212
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,400
I honestly

213
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,080
don't have much confidence in

214
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
playing well in the points race.

215
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,520
That's good.

216
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm not going anyway.

217
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,200
If you have

218
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,000
any new ideas,

219
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
remember to tell me.

220
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,200
You don't have to think about me.

221
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,680
Just go if you want.

222
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,880
We made a deal

223
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,600
to win the championship together.

224
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,320
That's our deal.

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,520
Who want to

226
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,320
win the championship with them?

227
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,800
Besides

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I didn't want to join them.

229
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,600
Why not?

230
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm a dignified man.

231
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
It would be humiliated for me

232
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,440
to act as an assistant of Liu Yanze.

233
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,320
Shabby-genteel.

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,240
Then let's make a deal that

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,920
no one will go.

236
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,160
Deal.

237
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,960
Hello, check please.

238
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,520
Is your new hobby photography

239
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,680
or sneak shots?

240
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,440
What?

241
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,920
Give it to me.

242
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,960
A bad-looking shot is called a sneak shot

243
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,120
and a good-looking one is called a snapshot.

244
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
Here. Let me have a look.

245
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh.

246
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,240
It has kind of

247
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
postmodernist style.

248
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,800
German artist

249
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,880
Richter once said

250
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,120
photo

251
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
is the perfect painting.

252
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,240
Look

253
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,280
the core of this photo

254
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,680
is idealism

255
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,920
and metaphysics.

256
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,200
Look.

257
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
You do understand.

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,040
After seeing Xiaoyu

259
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,320
things get different.

260
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,920
You completely come alive.

261
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,400
It's more useful

262
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
than us.

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
Right, Mengyuan?

264
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,600
The mountains have trees and trees have branches.

265
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,120
The mountains have trees.

266
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Mengyuan

267
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,240
The mountains have trees.

268
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,880
What are you doing?

269
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,360
What are you talking about?

270
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,240
You're in love.

271
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,520
What's going on? Be honest.

272
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,600
Say something!

273
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,440
Don't say anything, right?

274
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,080
Fine.

275
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,080
Come on.

276
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,560
Once upon a time there was a mountain.

277
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,760
There was a temple in the mountain.

278
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
There was an old monk in the temple

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,840
who kept ringing the bell every day.

280
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,080
Wait, wait, wait.

281
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,280
I met true love.

282
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,200
Gao Jingwen

283
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,920
Gao Jingwen

284
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,440
Gao Jingwen, right?

285
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
The one who plays tennis, right?

286
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,720
Yeah.

287
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Love at first sight, right?

288
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
Yeah.

289
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,040
That's pretty much it.

290
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
I'll help you check her out.

291
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
Yeah.

292
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,720
What's going on?

293
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,080
Are you sick?

294
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,200
No.

295
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,680
The physical test is coming.

296
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,840
I have 800-meter-panic.

297
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,240
Qing, don't be afraid.

298
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,200
By the time

299
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,360
we will all be with you.

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,240
Alas.

301
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,280
Since junior high school

302
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,480
I ran off half a life

303
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,200
for 800 meters test

304
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,360
each time

305
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,080
but never passed.

306
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,600
In the middle school examination,

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,240
if I had not crawled through the line

308
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,600
and earned some sympathy,

309
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,360
I could not even go to senior high school.

310
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,920
Senior high school also has sports points.

311
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,480
Because I was so scared

312
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,040
I had nightmares every day and suffered hair loss.

313
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,720
Finally, the hospital

314
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,000
gave me a mental certificate.

315
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,160
It will not be so strict in the university.

316
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
The teachers are very nice.

317
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,280
I didn't even have the courage

318
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,360
to walk to the runway.

319
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,440
I got an idea.

320
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
What? Where are you going?

321
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,640
I drop out of school

322
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,080
and repeat my senior high.

323
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,160
Next year, I will be admitted

324
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,520
to a university that does not need to

325
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,400
run 800 meters.

326
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,920
Well.

327
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,440
The 800-meter test is a hard target for universities.

328
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,800
Every university has it.

329
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
The 800-meter test has already begun?

330
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,280
Not yet.

331
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,400
See how scared you are.

332
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,840
But since you

333
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,720
don't do planning,

334
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
we can only do it for you.

335
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,800
First, running training.

336
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,040
Breakfast is ready

337
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
get up.

338
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,720
No. No way.

339
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm not going.

340
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,560
I'll fall there

341
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,720
within 200 meters.

342
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Really, believe me.

343
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,760
Leave me alone.

344
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,480
Then we'll have to do it.

345
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,960
Come on.

346
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,960
Just leave me alone.

347
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,560
Try it, just in case it works.

348
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
I've tried it all my life.

349
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,120
If it could work, it would have worked long ago.

350
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
Sis, please.

351
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,960
For the sake of

352
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,560
we accompany you

353
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,120
to run

354
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,680
in such a hot day,

355
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,720
try again.

356
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,480
Yeah.

357
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,680
I'm not sure

358
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
if I could make it.

359
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,560
Don't get your hopes up.

360
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,480
I may be stuck

361
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,480
on 200 meters.

362
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,080
Are you ready for this?

363
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,840
Ready?

364
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,880
Go.

365
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,280
Oops.

366
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,800
Qing

367
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,560
Are you okay?

368
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,960
Are you okay?

369
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,320
I forgot to tell you just now.

370
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,680
Every time I ran 800 meters

371
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,960
I would be too nervous

372
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,320
and fall in a few steps.

373
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,520
Why are you so scared?

374
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,080
In the second year of senior high

375
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,720
there was a time when our class

376
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,480
and the class next door

377
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,680
ran the 800 meters together.

378
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,840
There was a boy in the next class

379
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,040
who wanted to help me.

380
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,480
He knew I couldn't run fast

381
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
so he ran on my track

382
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,640
and led me to run.

383
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,080
As a result, I was nervous and fell.

384
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,320
He couldn't stop

385
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,840
and stepped right over me.

386
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,640
Ah?

387
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,760
Anyway

388
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,320
I have tried quite a few times for this.

389
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
I know that I really can't do it.

390
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,240
So it's better to give up.

391
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,200
No.

392
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,880
There is still a long time

393
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,200
before the 800 meters test.

394
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,400
Let's think about it.

395
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
You should find something else

396
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
to waste time.

397
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,720
Can you understand how I feel?

398
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,800
I understand.

399
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,000
Just like me in the debate.

400
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,000
No matter how motivated I am or how hard I try

401
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,240
I just can't win against Yin Nan.

402
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,960
In the past, I would take it too hard.

403
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,800
Now I have got over it.

404
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,600
If you can't do it, just accept it.

405
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

406
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,880
How is it?

407
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,680
Stop.

408
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,360
You always pinch me when you get excited.

409
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Step back.

410
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,160
Step back.

411
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,760
Sit down.

412
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,200
Mengyuan

413
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,440
I really envy you

414
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,640
for having such a good buddy like me.

415
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,560
I've made all the inquiries for you.

416
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,880
Goddess Gao Jingwen,

417
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,840
sophomore at the art department,

418
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,640
who is gentle and quiet, and loves painting and calligraphy.

419
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
She lives in the building

420
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,520
opposite the second alley.

421
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,640
She's definitely a beauty from a decent family.

422
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,160
Single.

423
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Sit down.

424
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,360
Sit down.

425
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,360
Then the man next door in 201

426
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,400
expressed love to her

427
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,840
and scattered flowers all over the place.

428
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,320
It's normal.

429
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
Since Gao Jingwen started college

430
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,160
she has rejected someone

431
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,080
every few days.

432
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,200
I have asked around for you.

433
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,920
Gao Jingwen goes to the school gym

434
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,200
every day after school.

435
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,400
Every Tuesday and Thursday

436
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
she usually goes to play tennis.

437
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,280
She broke up two years ago.

438
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,240
Her ex-boyfriend

439
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,400
was the top student of college entrance exam in their city.

440
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,000
Later he was admitted to Peking University

441
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,440
so they broke up.

442
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,840
Let's forget about it.

443
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,800
Hey.

444
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,840
You can't.

445
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,640
Didn't you have to marry her before?

446
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,480
Well.

447
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,640
She is not a goddess.

448
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,760
She is obviously a fairy.

449
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,760
I suck.

450
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Obviously

451
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,240
I won't be able to make it

452
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,040
and I'll lose face when the time comes.

453
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,640
Stand up.

454
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,000
Mengyuan

455
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,360
What?

456
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,440
If you are a man, show some confidence.

457
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,080
You have many advantages.

458
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,040
For example?

459
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,840
Yuan

460
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,080
Yuan

461
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,680
Go ahead.

462
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,160
Don't dare to.

463
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,360
You don't dare. You...

464
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,080
That's your true love.

465
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,560
So I should be cautious.

466
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
If you like her, go ahead.

467
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
What are you hesitating for?

468
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,600
Why are you working so hard

469
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,800
in the gym every day?

470
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,040
Strengthen my body.

471
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,320
If you're still stalling, I'll kick you.

472
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,040
Don't suppress your nature.

473
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,360
If you like her, just go.

474
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
Okay, I'll go.

475
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Go.

476
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,040
What am I going to do?

477
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,800
You still need to rely on me at this critical time.

478
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,840
Here.

479
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
Take it and give her.

480
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,520
Go for it.

481
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,560
What's the matter?

482
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,360
I can't unscrew this bottle of water.

483
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,040
Can you help me?

484
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,840
He...

485
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,440
Thank you.

486
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,040
Hell.

487
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,920
You pissed me off.

488
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
You are a seven-foot man.

489
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,240
You let a girl to unscrew the bottle cap.

490
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,000
What are you thinking of?

491
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,160
Don't give up.

492
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,840
Go.

493
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,800
Don't give up on me.

494
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,160
Get a towel.

495
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,480
Go and wipe her sweat.

496
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,920
Show her your tender man side.

497
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,040
You, hurry up.

498
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,120
What's wrong?

499
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,040
Here.

500
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Towel.

501
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
Say it.

502
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
Ten yuan for each.

503
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,680
Do you want one?

504
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,680
I...

505
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,680
No, thanks.

506
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,480
Never mind.

507
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,360
Why is this man

508
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,120
a bit naive?

509
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,280
Yeah.

510
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,040
I think he's foolish

511
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,880
and kind of funny.

512
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,160
Come here.

513
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,480
You can't even do such a little thing.

514
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,160
It's just to flirt with girls.

515
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,640
If I were you

516
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,520
I'd take her down in a minute.

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,320
Can you do it?

518
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,040
Oh

519
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,840
I didn't see it before.

520
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
You are quite capable.

521
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,280
No.

522
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,640
Do you know what's going on?

523
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,080
That is a lifelong business for him.

524
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,720
You have been sighing all day.

525
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,560
Life is bottlenecked again?

526
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,240
Stuck before the bottleneck is reached.

527
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
How can I

528
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
talk to her?

529
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,680
Just accost her directly.

530
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,720
Fast, accurate, and tough.

531
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
When Mengyuan finds the topic

532
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,200
she will be full of children and grandchildren.

533
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
It doesn't matter. Let's give her a gift.

534
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,120
If she doesn't accept the gift

535
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,200
at least you can talk to her.

536
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,200
If she takes it

537
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,560
that is the token of love.

538
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,160
Such a good deal!

539
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,880
What should I give her then?

540
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
USB flash drive.

541
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,400
You can also engrave on it.

542
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,960
Why it sounds

543
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
so obscene?

544
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,960
Hey.

545
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,800
That's it.

546
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Look, it makes girls

547
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,800
crying.

548
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,120
Can it work?

549
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,080
Oh my god, buy it!

550
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,680
Are you retarded?

551
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,280
I told you to buy roses.

552
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,320
Did I ask you to buy Lotus?

553
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,560
You...

554
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,600
Can you two be serious?

555
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,120
Huh?

556
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,640
I'm still counting on you two

557
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
to help me get her heart.

558
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,640
Of course.

559
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,720
Don't be sad.

560
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
Don't be discouraged. Be confident.

561
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,400
For girl's gift

562
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,880
cosmetics is the eternal first choice.

563
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,080
Good boy.

564
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,440
This one.

565
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
This is the one.

566
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
Oh my god, buy it!

567
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,320
My son.

568
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
It's been more than a week

569
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,720
since you disappeared.

570
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,920
Where are you now?

571
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,320
How are you doing?

572
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,160
Mom missed you so much.

573
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,480
Where are you going?

574
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,840
Tao Hao said

575
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,040
re-examination is not possible.

576
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,040
I've already had a plan.

577
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,160
The head of the department is going to Guangzhou

578
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,120
for a seminar.

579
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,560
I've applied to be his assistant.

580
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,680
By the time there will be typhoon in Guangzhou.

581
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,040
The flight will be canceled.

582
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
If we take the high-speed train, we will be back at night

583
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,480
and perfectly miss the physical test.

584
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,480
Start to risk your life.

585
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,720
What's wrong with you again?

586
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
The organizers said that

587
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
the seminar was postponed

588
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,240
in consideration of the safety of travel

589
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,880
in typhoon weather.

590
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,760
You can think of a life-threatening way.

591
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,720
It's no big deal to take the test.

592
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,040
I think for people like you

593
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,200
maybe it will work.

594
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,840
Do not persuade Qing.

595
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,640
If she can't run 800 meters

596
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,880
she just can't.

597
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,760
Why do you have to

598
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,920
let her fail again?

599
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,760
Right?

600
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm with you.

601
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,320
Xiaoyu

602
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,720
I had a problem with my computer.

603
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
Lend me yours for a while.

604
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
I need to send an email soon.

605
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,560
Okay, the password is my birthday.

606
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm going out for a while.

607
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,320
I have an appointment with Nan Bei.

608
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,320
Have fun.

609
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
Hey, we're closing.

610
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
Come tomorrow.

611
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,640
Okay, right away.

612
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,560
Let's go then.

613
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,040
Give me a second, Nan Bei.

614
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,280
I'll write down this point.

615
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,520
It's particularly good.

616
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,280
The next debate we will definitely...

617
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,360
Let's go.

618
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Get a cup of milk tea.

619
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,640
No.

620
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
What's wrong with you?

621
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,080
The 800-meter physical test is coming next week.

622
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,080
I'm so annoyed.

623
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,560
You are so strong, what are you afraid of?

624
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,200
Overthinking.

625
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,240
Is that me?

626
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,360
It's Qing.

627
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,560
What's wrong with her?

628
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,520
She has a phobia of 800 meters.

629
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,560
In order to escape the physical test

630
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
she's going to go back to senior high school.

631
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,400
Isn't the physical test easy?

632
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,520
You've got an idea?

633
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,800
Do you feel that

634
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,840
something is calling me?

635
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,480
Yes?

636
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,280
Yes, I guess.

637
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,880
Ahh?

638
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,560
Wait.

639
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,320
Yes or not?

640
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,720
Hey.

641
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,480
We are hiding like this.

642
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,160
What is the point of it?

643
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,160
Hey.

644
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,800
Tianchong

645
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,760
Nan Bei

646
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,360
Where are you going? The gym?

647
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,440
What a coincidence.

648
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,440
Bye-Bye.

649
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,240
Just the right size.

650
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,440
Tony

651
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,240
From now on

652
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,400
this will be your home.

653
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,760
It's really little Xiaoyu.

654
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,440
That's my son.

655
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,600
Mu Xiaoyu

656
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,840
What are you talking about?

657
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,000
This is my Tony.

658
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,520
Don't be afraid, senior.

659
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm here.

660
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,680
Mu Xiaoyu

661
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
I'm warning you to stop this nonsense.

662
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,960
You haven't forgotten that

663
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,080
I'm an orange belt in karate, have you?

664
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
You want to practice?

665
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,000
Fine.

666
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,920
Good evening.

667
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,120
The visibility tonight

668
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
for the stars...

669
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
There's no star.

670
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,120
You tell me

671
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,480
why you have it?

672
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
A meeting of destiny.

673
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,080
Ugh.

674
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,280
You have no idea

675
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,440
how painful it is.

676
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
I don't know what you are talking about.

677
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,080
You don't know how happy Tony is

678
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
to be with me.

679
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
You don't understand it at all.

680
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,320
What's going on here?

681
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
Looks like they're

682
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,840
vying for a guy named Tony.

683
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Well...

684
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,840
If you don't want to

685
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,040
be in the hot searches tomorrow

686
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,280
turn down the volume a little bit.

687
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,880
Okay?

688
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,160
You give it back to me.

689
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,320
Boring.

690
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,400
Yin Nan, come back.

691
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,880
Calm down, calm down.

692
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,920
Yin Nan, come back.

693
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,280
You give it back to me.

694
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,320
Calm down, outwit her.

695
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,560
Nan Bei, you are most unqualified

696
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,400
to say such things to me.

697
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,040
If it weren't for you

698
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,720
Tony and I wouldn't be separated at all.

699
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Let's get out of here.

700
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,720
Wonderful.

701
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,280
The girl cheated first.

702
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,080
Life is like a drama.

703
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,520
Not anyone else

704
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,040
but Yin Nan picked it up.

705
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,120
Fine.

706
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,720
Everything has its pros and cons.

707
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,600
You know it's alive now

708
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,880
isn't it a big blessing?

709
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,200
Can you stop talking?

710
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,600
Does Yin Nan know my son?

711
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,040
She knows nothing.

712
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,280
What is little Xiaoyu's

713
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,880
favorite food?

714
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,360
It's cucumber strips.

715
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,040
What it loves to do?

716
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,880
It's to relax the muscles and bones

717
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,120
in the dormitory.

718
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,560
It likes to listen to

719
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,880
Katy Perry's songs the most.

720
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
Does Yin Nan know about these?

721
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,920
She doesn't know.

722
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,040
My son must

723
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,160
don't want to live now.

724
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,560
As its mother

725
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,520
now I'm going to save it.

726
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
OK. I wish you an early reunion

727
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,160
with your little Xiaoyu.

728
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,520
But do you have a plan?

729
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,080
Nan Bei, come here.

730
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
There's no one else here.

731
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,600
Come here.

732
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,600
What?

733
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,280
Don't make it as if

734
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,160
it's nothing to do with you.

735
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,200
You lost little Xiaoyu.

736
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,880
You give it back.

737
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,720
It hurts.

738
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,880
Generally this situation

739
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,800
is a psychological effect.

740
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,840
Let me diagnose you.

741
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,160
Hold your breath.

742
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,160
Inhale.

743
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,360
Um...

744
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
Your bones are unusual.

745
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,040
You should be a great athlete.

746
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,320
What era is it?

747
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,680
It's 0202.

748
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,280
You diagnose psychological problems

749
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,960
through pulse?

750
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,320
Right.

751
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,040
We are here

752
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,200
to solve problems today.

753
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,840
No time to fool around with you.

754
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,240
You can't avoid it.

755
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,080
We have to find a way to solve it.

756
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,120
Or I'd rather take a look at

757
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
that seminar.

758
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
No, no, no.

759
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,280
One more chance.

760
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,520
A good student

761
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,400
is driven to revolt

762
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,960
by an eight-hundred-meter.

763
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,520
Can there be another way?

764
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,760
At the moment

765
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,160
there is no other way but to face it.

766
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
It doesn't work as expected.

767
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,040
Be detected.

768
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,840
What is as expected?

769
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,240
Let me tell you

770
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,200
you'd better be smart

771
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,160
for the plan to rescue my son.

772
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,280
Otherwise, you'll be punished for all your crimes

773
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,960
and you'll spend the rest of your life

774
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,880
in a wheelchair.

775
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,880
Relax.

776
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,480
I've got it all planned out.

777
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,440
First, you need to find a time

778
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,680
when Yin Nan is not in the dormitory.

779
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,800
I will attract the attention

780
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
of the dorm keeper.

781
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,720
You successfully

782
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
enter the senior dormitory.

783
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,840
When you get little Xiaoyu

784
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,640
don't rush out

785
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,000
because you will be captured by the camera.

786
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,880
You need to disguise.

787
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,160
Tie little Xiaoyu with a rope

788
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,520
and bring it down from the window.

789
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,400
I'll be responsible for the reception from below.

790
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,800
When we get little Xiaoyu

791
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,240
meet here.

792
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,040
Mission accomplished.

793
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,040
Isn't it a perfect plan?

794
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,840
Not too bad.

795
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,960
Move.

796
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,880
Auntie

797
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,560
Do you know

798
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,120
what gift I gave my mom the first time

799
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,360
for her birthday?

800
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,080
I...

801
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,560
gave her a baseball.

802
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,280
You know?

803
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,600
Just a bat

804
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,000
it was hit there.

805
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,400
Hello.

806
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,640
Hey.

807
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,240
Yin Nan's dormitory door

808
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,360
was locked.

809
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,400
Ah.

810
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,600
She might have locked it.

811
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,200
But it doesn't matter.

812
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
This is a little problem

813
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,560
and can be solved.

814
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,760
Now you find a hairpin.

815
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,160
Wait.

816
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,600
I'll teach you to unlock on the phone.

817
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,040
Then?

818
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,480
First break the hairpin open

819
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,960
and put it into the lock hole.

820
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,520
You unlock the electronic lock with a hairpin?

821
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,560
What do you think this year is, 1902?

822
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,120
Electronic lock?

823
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,040
Yeah.

824
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,440
Password

825
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,400
try

826
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,160
one one one one.

827
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,200
Operation failed.

828
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,240
It's not right.

829
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,920
One one one two.

830
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,960
Operation failed.

831
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,680
It doesn't work.

832
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,840
I get it.

833
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,080
One one one three.

834
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,920
Idiot Nan Bei. I would have died here

835
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,160
when I try it out.

836
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,840
Eagle homing.

837
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,400
Repeat, eagle homing.

838
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,120
Hello.

839
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,360
Why are you running again?

840
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,520
I was thinking

841
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,040
that if I run myself to prostration

842
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,400
and my brain goes blank,

843
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,720
I will

844
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,120
stop thinking about Jingwen all the time?

845
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,000
Alas.

846
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,320
Here it is.

847
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,600
Waiting for your reply in two days.

848
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,200
Are you really not going?

849
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,840
No.

850
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,080
I definitely won't go.

851
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,320
Do you want to order or not?

852
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,200
I'm sorry.

853
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,880
Then two cups of Quan Jiafu.

854
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,800
Grande, no ice and no sugar.

855
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,720
OK.

856
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,560
Tao Hao

857
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,960
Senior

858
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,440
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

859
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,200
No.

860
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,920
Then why are you covering your chest?

861
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,280
Stress response triggered by the hit

862
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,920
results in rapid blood backflowing.

863
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,640
It may cause sudden death.

864
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,000
You have this disease?

865
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,640
Not really.

866
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,280
Oh.

867
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,200
Oh.

868
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,880
It's about team two, isn't it?

869
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,320
Nan Bei said to me

870
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,600
how to say it

871
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,480
a living dog is better than a dead lion, right?

872
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,400
Tao Hao

873
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,760
The first half-yearly statement of club property

874
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,360
is on Mr. Li's desk in the office.

875
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,840
Could you please send it to Building One?

876
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,640
Shui

877
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,560
Give me a latte, please.

878
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,640
Okay, scan the code yourself.

879
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,200
Yeah.

880
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,600
Why are the pockets so deep?

881
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,880
Senior, let me pay it.

882
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,280
That's not right. I'll do it.

883
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,920
On me.

884
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,800
On me.

885
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,480
On me.

886
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
On me.

887
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,320
Thank you.

888
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,280
So do you want to go to team two?

889
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,240
If they want to go, I want to go.

890
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,880
Oh.

891
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,320
Thank you.

892
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,120
Why is yours so fast?

893
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,680
I know what I want

894
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,520
of course it's fast.

895
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,640
If you want everything

896
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,800
of course it will be slow.

897
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,960
Young girl

898
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,160
where are you going?

899
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Don't look at me.

900
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,280
I am on the same side with them.

901
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,240
Take her back.

902
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,240
No, no, no.

903
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,280
No, I'm not running away.

904
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm going to Guangzhou.

905
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,720
That seminar is open again.

906
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,320
So I have to...

907
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
I've already heard from Mr. Li.

908
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,520
You have long been removed from the list.

909
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,760
You guys just let me go.

910
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,160
I really don't want to run 800 meters.

911
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
Let's go back and talk about it.

912
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,720
Can't you think about it in the long run?

913
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,160
No.

914
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,880
Can you have a little ambition?

915
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,440
Qing

916
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,520
Where is your dignity?

917
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,000
What's the use of dignity?

918
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,400
Don't stop me.

919
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,080
Mengyuan, Mengyuan

920
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,040
Don't stop me.

921
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,200
You're at least a sportsman.

922
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
I don't want to stay here.

923
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,600
I want to go home.

924
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,000
No, no.

925
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,920
You are at least good at fitness.

926
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,680
You have to have dignity.

927
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,240
What's the point of dignity?

928
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,000
I can't.

929
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,880
No, no.

930
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,560
I want to go home.

931
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,040
Taxi, wait for me.

932
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,120
Taxi.

933
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,800
Qing

934
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,960
Don't be too extreme.

935
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,400
In fact

936
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,320
there are many people

937
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,360
who failed the 800-meter-run.

938
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,320
However

939
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,840
according to my experience in these three years

940
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,600
as long as you go on the field

941
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,240
even if you walk to the end

942
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,480
you will have scores.

943
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,200
No, I definitely can't.

944
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,240
Ask your own heart

945
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,440
what you really want.

946
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
Just go for it.

947
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
Whatever the way

948
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,920
you have to say it.

949
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,840
If you say it

950
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,920
even if

951
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,000
there is a 99% chance

952
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
of being rejected

953
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,160
you still have

954
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,200
a 1% chance

955
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,040
of being accepted.

956
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,680
But if you do not say

957
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,240
the possibility will always be zero.

958
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm not going.

959
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,760
If it takes me ten minutes to walk the 800 meters

960
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,960
I might as well not walk.

961
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,720
The whole school will laugh at me.

962
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,760
I will not walk.

963
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,520
Qing

964
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,080
No one wants to be the last.

965
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,440
Even no one

966
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,400
wants to be the second.

967
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,440
But think about it

968
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
who can

969
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,720
do the best of everything?

970
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,120
Your own idea matters.

971
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,560
Do you care more about

972
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,600
what those unacquainted

973
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,400
onlookers think

974
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,520
or do you value us more?

975
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
But it's too embarrassing to be rejected.

976
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,760
What's wrong with being embarrassed?

977
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,280
What will you lose for that?

978
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,880
If you don't do something embarrassing

979
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,120
can you still call it youth?

980
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,840
If you don't do something stupid now

981
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,440
will you do it when you are forty?

982
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,280
If you leave

983
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,880
who will accompany us to the milk tea store?

984
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,360
There will be no group purchase price for cosmetics.

985
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,520
The most important thing is

986
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,560
who will chat with you

987
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,640
in the middle of the night?

988
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,440
Mengyuan

989
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,560
If you really take Jing Wen

990
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,920
as the girl

991
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,360
you can give everything for

992
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,880
I think face

993
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,280
is not at all

994
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,400
what you need to consider.

995
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,120
Nan Bei

996
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,200
Are you persuading yourself

997
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,480
or Mengyuan?
