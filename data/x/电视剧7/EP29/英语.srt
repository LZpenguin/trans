00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP29

2
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,120
I'm sorry.

3
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
You...

4
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,520
Don't be impulsive.

5
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
As your girlfriend,

6
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,120
I didn't notice anything wrong with you.

7
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
So I hope you...

9
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,600
No, no, no.

10
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
Calm down.

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,960
Take it easy. It doesn't matter.

12
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm worried about you.

13
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,360
Are you nervous?

14
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,720
Yeah.

15
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,120
Then why don't you tell me?

16
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Because you said last night

17
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,040
you were afraid that

18
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,760
all our previous efforts would be in vain.

19
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,280
So?

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,680
Therefore, when you are

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,120
puzzled,

22
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,240
I should reassure you

23
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,640
and let you have no worries.

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
Not like now.

25
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,880
I make you worry.

26
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
I go to the library

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,560
because I want to adjust myself

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,440
before you find out.

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,200
Nan Bei, we're not only couple,

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,880
but also comrades fighting together.

31
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,720
So don't hide anything from me

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,480
in the future.

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,600
Can you?

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
We have been together for so long.

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,120
I never thought that

36
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,760
you would be so gentle.

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,200
Facing the finals,

38
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,960
everyone will be under pressure.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,920
That's normal.

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,160
But I think,

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,400
it's the same as the NCEE.

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
The more you prepare,

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,880
the calmer your mind will be.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
So let's prepare

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,080
for the debate together.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,800
But I still have one

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,560
barrier in my heart.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,360
What?

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,960
That's...

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,880
Nan Bei

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Are you afraid of Liu Yanze?

52
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,120
Who's afraid of him?

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,480
Why are you trembling?

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,560
I am excited

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
about winning the championship.

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Nan Bei, it doesn't matter.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,960
This is the psychological reaction.

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,560
I've been like this before.

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,320
Why don't you let Ma Nan help you?

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,400
You're having the pre-match stress response.

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,480
It's called being cowardly.

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,720
How can you say that about him?

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,360
Help him figure it out.

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
Or I ask Liu Yanze to be merciful.

65
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,240
Maybe you should see a therapist.

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,520
Eat some croton and quit the debate with dignity.

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,920
You...

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,120
Can you have a little human nature

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
as teammates?

70
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm going out to practice my song.

71
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,840
Me, too.

72
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,440
What are you doing?

73
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
I want to listen to music.

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,200
That's why I love you.

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
They're training.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
Can you two stay here?

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm not going back.

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,760
They'll laugh at me.

79
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,560
They're caring about you.

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,800
You also think it's not good for me

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,320
to be like this now, right?

82
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,960
I can understand your situation.

83
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,640
Really?

84
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,840
We have another band in our school.

85
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,720
Do you two know?

86
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,880
Yeah.

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,600
They seem to have performances every year.

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,520
Why don't you

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,440
go to the party every year?

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Because every school party

91
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
only needs a band to perform.

92
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
We lost to them

93
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,240
in every selection.

94
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,440
I haven't won Yin Nan either.

95
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,240
No.

96
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,400
You won her last time when you ate chili.

97
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,600
Don't mention it, okay?

98
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,440
Actually, I know

99
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,200
I have almost the same strength

100
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
as Liu Yanze now.

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,280
But I never

102
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,120
have won him once

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
in a debate.

104
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
Every time I think I can

105
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,440
win,

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
it ends in failure.

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,960
It becomes a habit now.

108
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
I feel habitually

109
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm going to lose to him this time.

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,520
It's scary.

111
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
Everybody's afraid to lose.

112
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
It's normal.

113
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,120
But you can think about it from another way.

114
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,760
Maybe we are

115
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,680
one step away from victory.

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,440
I don't want to lose.

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,080
I don't want you to lose.

118
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,320
I have a habit.

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,160
When I'm unhappy, I'll sing.

120
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,120
Go ahead.

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,840
We have a new habit.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,640
When we're unhappy, we want to hear others sing.

123
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,080
Do you believe in miracles?

124
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,200
No.

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,200
How about you?

126
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,880
Neither do I.

127
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
So I don't think this time

128
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
I can win Liu Yanze.

129
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
It doesn't matter.

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
We can cry

131
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,280
on each other's shoulder.

132
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Will you think I

133
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,840
drop the ball at the last minute?

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Never.

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
When I'm hesitant

136
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,880
to join the team two,

137
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
you encourage me.

138
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,040
When I have a conflict with Yin Nan,

139
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,040
you also support me.

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,360
And several times

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,320
when I feel too tired

142
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
to stick to it,

143
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,760
you are always with me.

144
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,880
So in my heart,

145
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
no matter what,

146
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,840
let alone Liu Yanze,

147
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,880
no one can compare to you.

148
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,360
For you,

149
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,000
for our team,

150
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
I will do my best.

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,160
Nan Bei

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,720
But I think

153
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
who works harder

154
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
is more hopeful.

155
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
This kind of thing

156
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,120
does not require miracles at all.

157
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
Brothers, I completely collapse.

158
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,200
For my educated and reasonable,

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,360
gentle and lovely girlfriend, Xiaoyu,

160
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,000
you must help me

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,640
at this time.

162
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,960
Educated and reasonable? Gentle and lovely ?

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,840
Who?

164
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,840
Come on.

165
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,440
Go away.

166
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,440
Help me.

167
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,000
I enroll you in a stress relief class.

168
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Go early tomorrow morning.

169
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,080
Good brother.

170
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,160
Breathe in.

171
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,960
Breathe out.

172
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,800
Breathe in.

173
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
Breathe out.

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,640
Touch your abdomen with your hands gently.

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Touch your abdomen with your hands.

176
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,080
Feel

177
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
the power from your baby.

178
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
When making an appointment,

179
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
you hope that it works quickly.

180
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,160
I prepare a few boxes of medicine for you.

181
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,200
Modified Xiaoyao Pill

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
Ginseng Spleen-invigorating Bolus

183
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
Liuwei Dihuang Pill

184
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Strengthening waist and kidney...

185
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,560
Excuse me, this is mine.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,120
Aren't you a western doctor?

187
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
The combination of Chinese and Western medicine has a fast curative effect.

188
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
But these drugs are useless for kidney deficiency.

189
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,680
This disease mainly

190
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,720
depends on self-treatment.

191
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,640
Willing to hear the details.

192
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,120
Psychologically speaking,

193
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,800
this disease

194
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,120
is actually a state of your mind.

195
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,920
Come on.

196
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,640
We all like your band very much.

197
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,120
Thank you.

198
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,760
What are you drawing?

199
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,760
You draw this.

200
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,640
This is spread rapidly on the campus network.

201
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,480
That's right.

202
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm the author.

203
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,080
I heard about the band.

204
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
I think it's a pity.

205
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,040
So I draw a short comic

206
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,240
and posted on the campus network.

207
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,800
I drew casually.

208
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,400
I didn't expect a good response.

209
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,960
Their band has a lot of fans.

210
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,600
Moreover,

211
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,480
they also pull me

212
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,920
to the fan base.

213
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
Some people in the group

214
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
have been begging not to dissolve.

215
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,360
They want to hear them sing again.

216
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720
And you see...

217
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,960
There are so many fans of yours

218
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,440
in the school.

219
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,600
And they all support you very much.

220
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,960
There are still many people

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,640
who leave a message below

222
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,040
and say they want to hear you sing again.

223
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,720
That's right.

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,200
So many people in the school

225
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,280
know us.

226
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,480
Even I have a fan base. Look.

227
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,360
It's really well painted.

228
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,800
Thank you, Dango.

229
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,720
It's ok.

230
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
This is mainly because your stories

231
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,040
are inspirational.

232
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,760
Look. There is

233
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,160
a top post.

234
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,520
Take a look, Shui.

235
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
They also want you

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
to participate in

237
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,600
the selection

238
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,440
of the school graduation party.

239
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,360
Hundreds of people

240
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,840
have already voted.

241
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,200
We

242
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
will go to be your

243
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,200
support groups.

244
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,800
No problem.

245
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,040
What's the matter?

246
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,760
Oh my god.

247
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,200
I didn't expect you to

248
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,520
be more miserable than us.

249
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,840
Before, you may have always felt that

250
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,800
you are isolated

251
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,600
and helpless.

252
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,640
Now so many people

253
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,320
are supporting you.

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,520
What if it will work?

255
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,440
Support can't change the result.

256
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
Unless a miracle happens.

257
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,240
Do you believe in miracles?

258
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,040
I don't believe it anyway.

259
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,120
Come on.

260
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,720
Team 235

261
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
becomes the champion of this provincial debate.

262
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,320
Congratulations!

263
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,840
Good morning.

264
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,760
Good morning.

265
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I haven't seen you all morning.

266
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,880
I thought you ran away.

267
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,360
What are you talking about?

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,000
How can Nan Bei do

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,520
that kind of thing?

270
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,360
Then start preparing quickly.

271
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,160
Time is running out.

272
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,440
Ah.

273
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,760
Don't worry.

274
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,600
My current treatment effect

275
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,400
has reached

276
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,920
an unprecedented state.

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,520
hello

278
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
The coach is gone.

279
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,520
Then you go to

280
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,720
the pork stomach and chicken restaurant to find him.

281
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,240
I'm not kidding you.

282
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,720
Listen to me.

283
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,080
What?

284
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,480
What's the matter?

285
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,880
The old professor went missing.

286
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,880
Coach?

287
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,720
Coach?

288
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:37,960
Excuse me.

289
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,720
Where is the patient

290
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,600
in room 407?

291
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,680
I don't know.

292
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,200
Dear coach, why are you here?

293
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,720
Coach,

294
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,360
call your wife

295
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
back.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
She is worried about you.

297
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,280
Is it because of

298
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,720
the operation?

299
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,880
When she was young,

300
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,880
she liked a novel

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,360
called Notre-Dame de Paris.

302
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,560
She kept saying that

303
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,560
she would wait for a chance

304
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,280
to go to Notre Dame de Paris.

305
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,560
How can we go abroad at that time?

306
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,360
Later, we can go abroad.

307
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,600
I told her to wait for my retirement.

308
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,120
After I retired,

309
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,840
I'll accompany you to Notre Dame de Paris.

310
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,840
Now I'm sick.

311
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,000
I have talked to the doctor about my illness.

312
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,720
If I have an operation,

313
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,440
there is only a 5% chance.

314
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,240
I can't go finally.

315
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
If I don't have an operation, I can go.

316
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,720
But I can't sit. I have to Lie down.

317
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,000
Buy a first-class cabin and lie down to Paris.

318
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
In this way,

319
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,760
she has to take care of me.

320
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,320
There is no chance.

321
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,040
Such a simple wish

322
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,720
cannot be realized for decades.

323
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,560
It can't be realized.

324
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,000
It's not the end of hills and rivers.

325
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,640
Coach

326
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,640
It's not too late to think about it now.

327
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,320
I understand.

328
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,440
The simpler the thing, the harder it is to achieve.

329
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,600
Like you,

330
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,840
you know exactly where the problem is.

331
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,520
But there is nothing to do.

332
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,480
It is really helpless.

333
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,360
Xiwang

334
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,280
Xiwang

335
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,360
Yes.

336
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,360
It's Xiwang.

337
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,920
Xiwang

338
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,360
Look, it's wearing a red scarf.

339
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,280
Xiwang is a swan.

340
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,760
Xiwang is a swan.

341
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,920
If I'm not mistaken,

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,480
it's a...

343
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,800
Xiwang

344
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,080
Hey,

345
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,760
the state is back.

346
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,320
I have successfully passed

347
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,880
the self-denial stage.

348
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
My present level and realm

349
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,800
has reached

350
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,080
a different height.

351
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,640
Cool.

352
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Tell me

353
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,840
what state you have reached.

354
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,600
Can you not be late?

355
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,280
Take a champion and give me a chance to show.

356
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,120
Mr. Li, you are an adult.

357
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,960
You believe him.

358
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,080
Too childish.

359
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,480
Don't kid me.

360
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,800
I come to inform you that

361
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,920
the time of oral defense has changed.

362
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960
It's changed to tomorrow afternoon.

363
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,640
But

364
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,680
we have the final tomorrow.

365
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,360
I know.

366
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,840
But the school's decision

367
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,040
cannot be changed

368
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,720
just because of you.

369
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,640
You discuss it.

370
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,520
There is no need to discuss.

371
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,520
Ma Nan goes to the oral defense.

372
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,080
Is your debate team all right?

373
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,040
No problem.

374
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,080
I'm here.

375
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,960
It's the same whether there is Ma Nan or not.

376
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,560
OK, don't be late and play well.

377
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,440
Don't embarrass me.

378
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:53,960
OK.

379
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
We will take the champion, Mr. Li.

380
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,800
No problem.

381
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,840
Come on.

382
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,600
At last it's my turn to say this.

383
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,240
It's time to show

384
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,920
our real strength.

385
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm glad

386
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,560
I didn't train you in vain.

387
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,240
But can you

388
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
really do it?

389
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,040
Don't talk about us.

390
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,320
Are you ready for your defense?

391
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,840
Well.

392
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,920
I am so young, lovely and energetic.

393
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,360
In the eyes of the judges,

394
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,120
I am better than you.

395
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,680
Although

396
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,120
you won't play with us this time,

397
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,760
we can still prepare for the game

398
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,720
together.

399
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,240
There is no difference.

400
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,160
OK.

401
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,680
After I participate in the defense,

402
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,120
I come to the awards ceremony

403
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
to win the prize together.

404
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,880
OK.

405
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,560
Then let's check the argument.

406
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,520
Check you.

407
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,160
You are lazy in daily life.

408
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,320
Do you do your task?

409
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,760
It's amazing, Dango.

410
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,160
Really?

411
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,400
Do you usually

412
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,320
hide your strength?

413
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,360
Come on.

414
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,480
No. I'm serious.

415
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,920
Look at this argument.

416
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,560
Wait a minute.

417
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
This is not my handwriting.

418
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,440
Zishi

419
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,320
Let's stop here today.

420
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,040
OK.

421
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,200
By the way,

422
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,360
I recommended something in Douban to you

423
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,280
last time.

424
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,840
Have you seen it?

425
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,680
It's quite interesting.

426
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,360
Really?

427
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,040
Come on.

428
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,800
In episode ten,

429
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,720
the two of them

430
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
were together.

431
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
Then they will...

432
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,080
Zishi

433
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,920
We are in the library now.

434
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,880
Keep your voice down.

435
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,400
Oh.

436
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,520
I don't mean to blame you.

437
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,840
Don't be angry.

438
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,040
You don't want to make me angry, right?

439
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,560
No, I don't.

440
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,240
Then...

441
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,680
If you coax me,

442
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,960
I won't be angry.

443
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,720
How to coax you?

444
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,040
And then you won't be angry.

445
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,840
You give me a kiss.

446
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,840
Kiss me and I won't be angry.

447
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,880
This is not suitable in the library.

448
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,720
Then I'll kiss you.

449
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,360
Bye!

450
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,720
I'm sorry.

451
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,640
The...

452
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,840
The notebooks given by the organizing committee

453
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,080
are too similar.

454
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,920
I took it by mistake.

455
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,360
Hello

456
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,640
Zishi

457
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,560
I can't find my notebook.

458
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,120
I wonder

459
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,360
if you take it by mistake

460
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,960
in the library.

461
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,920
Yes.

462
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Then can you

463
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,320
give it to me?

464
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,720
OK.

465
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Pick questions that don't involve content.

466
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,200
Are there any arguments we don't expect?

467
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,920
Yes.

468
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,720
Is it very tricky?

469
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,600
Yes.

470
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,880
Can we handle it?

471
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,360
Not that easy.

472
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
Then what should I do?

473
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
Forget it. I'll

474
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,480
give him the notebook.

475
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,120
I'll go.

476
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,000
I was the only one who read

477
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,840
the contents.

478
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,360
Do you want to tell him the truth?

479
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,560
I will

480
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,520
bear the consequences alone.

481
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,080
Is Nan Bei all right?

482
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,200
I believe him.

483
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,840
Have you seen it?

484
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,960
I-I didn't read.

485
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
You don't believe me?

486
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,360
I trust you.

487
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,080
Don't you

488
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,920
bear the consequences yourself?

489
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
I despise myself.

490
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,040
In fact, we understand you.

491
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,480
But

492
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,440
we know that Nan Bei

493
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,480
saw it unintentionally.

494
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,840
The other side may not think so.

495
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
Maybe they think

496
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
we have all seen it.

497
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,080
At that time,

498
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,120
they may also complain that we cheat.

499
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,280
Nan Bei, you say

500
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,680
what a disaster you have caused.

501
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

502
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,200
It was my fault.

503
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,800
Even if I don't tell you

504
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,560
the contents of the notebook,

505
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,880
I can't help thinking of

506
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,000
all kinds of ways

507
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,160
to deal with it.

508
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,440
So for the sake of fairness,

509
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,800
I won't play this debate.

510
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,680
No.

511
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,520
You can't play this debate.

512
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,160
I can't either.

513
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,200
No one can replace you.

514
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,920
How about

515
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
our substitute, Gong?

516
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,560
He is an exchange student.

517
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,960
He went abroad last month.

518
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,240
What should we do?

519
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,880
This is already the case.

520
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,280
When it comes to the contents

521
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,000
of the notebook,

522
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,360
I will not speak.

523
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,880
Don't be under pressure.

524
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,960
Prepare well what we should do.

525
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,160
I go out for a walk.

526
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,480
Then let's continue.

527
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,400
Here you are.

528
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,880
Thank you.

529
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,320
Yanze,

530
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,560
what do you think of this argument?

531
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,400
Yanze

532
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,920
What's wrong with you?

533
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm tired after tidying up,

534
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,160
so I take a rest.

535
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,520
Are you all right?

536
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,920
I...

537
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,960
It's okay. I'm bold.

538
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,160
Do you need help?

539
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,040
No.

540
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,320
This is Xiwang's cage.

541
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,560
You left it with us before.

542
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,160
Give it back to you.

543
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,720
Thank you.

544
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's put it here.

545
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,400
Can I write the story of you and Xiwang

546
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,160
into my song?

547
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,280
OK.

548
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,280
Then in case this song becomes popular,

549
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,120
can you share the copyright fee with me?

550
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,520
If it is really popular,

551
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,520
there is no problem.

552
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,880
What is the name of your song?

553
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,240
Miracles.

554
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,480
Miracles?

555
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,760
Miracles, I like it.

556
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,720
What's wrong with you?

557
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,680
Shui is leaving tomorrow.

558
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,160
Tomorrow?

559
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,800
Why is he in such a hurry?

560
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,400
Unfortunately, not everyone

561
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,040
can believe in miracles.

562
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,120
Ah.

563
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,040
Do you want to come

564
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,400
to see Xiwang?

565
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,880
I had an appointment with Xiaoyu by the lake.

566
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,720
OK.

567
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
After all, it has been raised here

568
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,080
for so long.

569
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,000
Let's go.

570
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,360
Xiaoyu

571
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,200
Thank Dango for helping me.

572
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Her comics

573
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,680
have attracted a lot of fans to us.

574
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,760
Never mind.

575
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,240
But didn't you go to the selection

576
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,400
for the graduation party?

577
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,640
Forget it. I'm a senior now,

578
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
so I don't want to toss about it.

579
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,400
But

580
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,520
I plan to

581
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,840
organize the original songs

582
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,920
in the past four years into albums

583
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,840
and publish them on the Internet.

584
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,200
It can be regarded as

585
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,560
a gift for fans.

586
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,040
After all,

587
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,280
an obscure band like us

588
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,760
is loved by so many people.

589
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,960
It's like a miracle.

590
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,520
It can also be regarded as

591
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,080
a result for fans.

592
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,680
Yes.

593
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,080
Come on.

594
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,360
There is a result for fans.

595
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,160
What about yourselves?

596
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
What are you excited about?

597
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,960
Because you're a senior,

598
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,120
you should fight for

599
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,960
the last time.

600
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,040
Besides,

601
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,120
Xiwang and I

602
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
are waiting for your song to be popular.

603
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,480
It is because we have lost for four years.

604
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,640
At last,

605
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,200
I don't want to lose again

606
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
and disappoint my fans.

607
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,560
Look at your

608
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,280
lyrics.

609
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,560
Even if you fall,

610
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,640
don't be afraid of ridicule. Keep running.

611
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,000
Even if you worry, don't run away.

612
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,760
Stick to it.

613
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,760
Lost everything you still have pride.

614
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,240
I have to find my own life.

615
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,560
Isn't this

616
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,120
written by you?

617
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,360
Aren't you a very upset

618
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,040
band?

619
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,960
How can you write

620
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,160
such positive lyrics?

621
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
Anyway, you have become accustomed

622
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,240
to losing.

623
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
You will not be uncomfortable for a few days.

624
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,240
But regrets will be remembered for a lifetime.

625
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,240
You just said too much

626
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,400
to Xiaoyang.

627
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,880
I talked to Xiaoyang before.

628
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,840
I know what she thinks.

629
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,480
If she loses

630
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
her last chance

631
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,080
because of fear this time,

632
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
she must have regrets in the future.

633
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,920
Just like our

634
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,040
final this time.

635
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,400
If I don't attend,

636
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,200
I will definitely regret it, right?

637
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,120
You have to decide this for yourself.

638
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,920
I will.

639
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,680
Old coach,

640
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,400
why are you here?

641
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,480
I am not at ease.

642
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,560
Take a look at the last debate.

643
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,240
Old coach,

644
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,040
don't always talk about the last.

645
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,080
It's unlucky.

646
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,400
Let's go and talk about it.

647
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,280
Definition, battlefield, offensive and defensive points, value,

648
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,960
there are some problems in every part.

649
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,880
We think

650
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,240
it may be that

651
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,840
there is no way to

652
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
determine the discussion situation of the topic.

653
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,920
So...

654
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,480
You find

655
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,320
if you put it in life,

656
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,880
it's difficult to explain the essence of the argument.

657
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,640
To be philosophical,

658
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,000
we have to do a lot of popular science work.

659
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,200
And the other side may not

660
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,080
be on the same channel

661
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,840
as you.

662
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,360
Yes.

663
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,240
Because there are too many angles,

664
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,320
we don't know where to start.

665
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,920
And we're more likely to win.

666
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,720
Each topic

667
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,000
has its value perspective.

668
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,320
It's the core of this debate.

669
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
The most important thing

670
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
for a debater at this moment

671
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,800
is to find the core of the debate,

672
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,760
which is the value perspective.

673
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,520
Not

674
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
the so-called methods that can win.

675
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,640
Then if the other side

676
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,840
always finds the easiest perspective to win.

677
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,880
Then hit him.

678
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,680
Then the opponent

679
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,600
will win more games.

680
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,480
But they give up

681
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,320
creating more valuable debates,

682
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,960
right?

683
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,720
Good.

684
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,840
Coach,

685
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,560
your wife has been looking for you all day.

686
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,600
Why are you here?

687
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,920
Let's go. I'll send you back.

688
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,160
It's time to go.

689
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,760
Don't worry.

690
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,480
I will broadcast it live to you

691
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,360
tomorrow.

692
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,160
OK.

693
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,440
Well.

694
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,800
Remember.

695
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,840
I can't spare anyone

696
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,840
who doesn't speak well tomorrow.

697
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,640
Old coach, your operation tomorrow...

698
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,040
Does your wife agree?

699
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,600
Yes.

700
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,400
I make the final decision.

701
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,080
Coach, coach.

702
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,240
Sit down.

703
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,160
Prepare for your debate.

704
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,960
The right choice...

705
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,400
You're back.

706
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,960
Why don't you tell me

707
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,360
when you go to school?

708
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,560
They are about to participate in the debate.

709
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,840
I am not at ease.

710
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
I go to take a look.

711
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,240
Don't have an operation.

712
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,160
I checked.

713
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,920
Many people

714
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,200
will not

715
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,440
get worse in a few years.

716
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,040
You have read this book for half your life.

717
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,760
You know it thoroughly by heart.

718
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,240
When I finish the operation,

719
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,680
I will accompany you to Notre Dame de Paris.

720
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,600
Really.

721
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,360
It doesn't matter.

722
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,240
We should believe in science, okay?

723
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,880
Believe in science.

724
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,760
Today you guys are so lucky.

725
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
You can eat as you like.

726
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
Drink as you like.

727
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,880
Enjoy yourselves.

728
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,640
Because tomorrow

729
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,000
I'll not be here.

730
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,040
Shui, don't worry.

731
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,280
I must have a good drink today.

732
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,320
I'll drink with you today.

733
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,160
OK.

734
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Good luck in the debate.

735
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
I wish us all the best.

736
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,640
Mountains are green forever.

737
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,720
Rivers are flowing continuously.

738
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
We shall meet again someday.

739
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,560
Come on.

740
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,360
There is one thing.

741
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,560
Your fans

742
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,320
write a petition of 100 people

743
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,840
below our comic series.

744
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,440
They hope you can participate in

745
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,800
the selection of graduation party.

746
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,160
At the graduation party,

747
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,720
they want to see your performance again.

748
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,880
Really?

749
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,320
It's true.

750
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,920
Shui,

751
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,040
why don't we try again?

752
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,960
Come on.

753
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,600
The second glass.

754
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,360
Cheers.

755
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,440
It's beautiful.

756
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,120
Yes.

757
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,600
The next one.

758
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,760
Look.

759
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,080
Ah...

760
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,720
I think we should travel by ourselves.

761
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,520
I have studied Russian.

762
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,920
But we're going to France.

763
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,440
Who can understand you when you speak Russian?

764
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,640
Oh, they don't understand Russian.

765
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,320
Xiaoyang

766
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,760
Xiaoyang, I'm sorry for you.

767
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,120
Do you know?

768
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,920
I was shocked

769
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,600
when I heard your voice at the orientation party for the first time.

770
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,440
It was the voice

771
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,200
that an angel had kissed.

772
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,960
I was thinking about

773
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,040
your voice, your look,

774
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,440
and my music.

775
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,040
If we combine together,

776
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,480
we will definitely make a difference.

777
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,920
But I didn't expect that

778
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,240
after our combination,

779
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,400
you didn't even

780
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,120
get on the school stage once.

781
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,360
I dragged you down.

782
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,600
I dragged you down.

783
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,720
Shui, I'm here.

784
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,880
You have worked

785
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,360
eighteen jobs in the past four years

786
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
to give me the opportunity to perform outside.

787
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,520
Otherwise,

788
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,440
there won't be these fans now.

789
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,560
I am sorry for you.

790
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,840
I am sorry for you.

791
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,120
If you form a band

792
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,760
with a cat,

793
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,680
it is much better than

794
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,160
with me now.

795
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,880
Really.

796
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,120
I-I have a drink.

797
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,960
Shui

798
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,720
Don't drink.

799
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,480
You're drunk.

800
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,720
I'll send you home. Go.

801
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,680
I-I have a drink.

802
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,640
Ah.

803
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,160
Let me send you.

804
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,840
It doesn't matter.

805
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,320
You help them clean up.

806
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,680
My youth

807
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,560
is a pity.

808
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,840
It's just the little things in life.

809
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,160
Do you know what youth is?

810
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,440
If you win happily, this is called youth.

811
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,360
But after losing,

812
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,640
crying heartbreakingly is also called youth.

813
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,960
Don't you have regrets?

814
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,600
I...

815
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,680
Ah...

816
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,560
I have a girlfriend.

817
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,280
The debate team also made a name for itself.

818
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,960
The only thing I lack

819
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,720
is to win

820
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,520
Liu Yanze on the debate.

821
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,680
You should understand me.

822
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,880
I know you do.

823
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,960
On my shoes again.

824
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,760
Ah!

825
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,040
Dango

826
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,400
Help me send a statement

827
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,320
under the petition.

828
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,960
I want to participate in the selection of the graduation party

829
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,760
in the name of our band.

830
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,920
Count me in.

831
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,040
Count me in.

832
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,960
Count me in.

833
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,480
Xiaoyang

834
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,320
I'm really glad that you can think so.

835
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
It doesn't matter whether we win or lose.

836
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,640
This is the right decision.

837
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,400
Good.

838
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,160
I like to meddle in this kind of business best.

839
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,960
Leave it to me.

840
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,720
Do you encounter the principle of hypnosis?

841
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,960
I don't want to think about Liu Yanze,

842
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
but he is always in my mind.

843
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,920
Don't worry about it.

844
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,240
Since you want to win him once,

845
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
don't think so much.

846
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,600
Just let go and win.

847
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,320
Yes.

848
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,000
No.

849
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,800
I really want to win him once.

850
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,880
But even if I attend the debate,

851
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,160
I feel so sorry

852
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,240
for our team.

853
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,440
And I think Liu Yanze

854
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,200
has known that.

855
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,920
I don't know why he

856
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,360
doesn't expose me.

857
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,520
The debate competition starts at ten o'clock tomorrow.

858
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,040
My defense begins at 9:30.

859
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,360
Half an hour per person. I'm the third one.

860
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,640
OK.

861
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,120
But I ask them to

862
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,120
let me be the first one.

863
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Then you can catch up with the game, right?

864
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,480
If I'm ten minutes late,

865
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,840
it shall be deemed as an automatic waiver.

866
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,720
Although

867
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,480
the school is very close

868
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,400
to the hotel of the debate,

869
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,520
it's only theoretically possible

870
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,680
to catch up.

871
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,640
So I didn't tell you.

872
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,240
Wait for you to figure it out.

873
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,120
Ma Nan

874
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,320
You are really a gentle man.

875
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,640
Don't disgust me.

876
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
I ask you.

877
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,400
Have you thought it over yet?

878
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,240
Do you want to attend or not?

879
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,920
I want.

880
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,920
But I think

881
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,640
I should make the right choice.

882
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,080
Let's go.

883
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,720
Don't be afraid.

884
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,200
I am not afraid to have you with me.

885
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,720
This is our last time

886
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,320
to stand on the school stage.

887
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,280
For four years,

888
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,600
we have been losing.

889
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
I used to think

890
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,720
I am a failure.

891
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,840
But looking back on this road,

892
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,640
we gain more than

893
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,120
we lose.

894
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,600
Although this time

895
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,520
we may still lose,

896
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,400
I know

897
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,280
I make the right decision,

898
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,960
a regretless decision.

899
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,520
Wait.

900
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,680
Then you go.

901
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,200
OK.

902
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:35,840
Change position.

903
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,520
Interesting.

904
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,360
Interesting.

905
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,200
Please keep quiet.

906
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,160
Our debate

907
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,360
is about to begin.

908
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,040
Before the start of the debate,

909
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,520
please set your mobile phone to vibrate

910
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,600
or mute state.

911
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,080
In the course of the debate,

912
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,360
please keep the arena

913
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,520
quiet at all times.

914
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,720
This is more conducive

915
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,760
to speakers' play.

916
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,160
Thank you for your cooperation.

917
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,080
Friends at the scene

918
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,920
and in front of the TV,

919
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,560
hello, everyone.

920
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,120
Welcome to

921
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,680
the final scene of the provincial league.

922
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,400
This league is hosted by the Provincial Youth League Committee.

923
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,640
It's organized by the college student association

924
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,000
of the whole province.

925
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,240
I am Wang Yini,

926
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,680
the chairman of this debate.

927
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,880
It is an honor to host today's competition.

928
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,680
Now, please allow me

929
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,680
to introduce you

930
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,440
today's judges and guests.

931
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,760
They are

932
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,040
Peng Feiyu,

933
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,200
researcher of Dongzhou Academy of Social Sciences,

934
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,520
Xia Weitong,

935
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,440
founder of

936
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,680
Dongzhou Debate League,

937
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,840
Yu Xi,

938
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,960
professor of School of Philosophy,

939
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,800
Dongzhou Jiao Tong University,

940
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,760
Zhang Hui, professor of the School of Arts,

941
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,400
Fulin University,

942
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,520
Wang Renjia, senior partner

943
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,040

944
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,040

00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,840
chief editor

948
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,160
of Dongzhou Times Newspaper Group.

949
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,120
Next, I will introduce

950
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,960
the debaters of both sides in today's competition.

951
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,080
Why don't you tell me you are on?

952
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,280
I won't tell you.

953
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,320
At least it is a secret.

954
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,320
Sitting on my left

955
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,400
is the negative side.

956
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,680
I won't show mercy this time.

957
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,600
I'll try not to let you lose

958
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,280
too badly.

959
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,320
Team 235

960
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,880
of Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics.

961
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,480
Today's resolution is whether the usefulness of the useless

962
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,760
is useful or useless.

963
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,320
I declare

964
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,960
the debate starts.

965
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,040
In the first round,

966
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,680
the first speaker of both sides

967
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,480
will make the speech.

968
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,600
Let's welcome the first speaker of affirmative side.

969
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,600
Please.

970
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,720
Thank you, Chairman.

971
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,200
Hello, everyone.

972
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,560
The usefulness of the useless

973
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,240
is from Ways of the Human World of Zhuangzi.

974
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,560
It's about a big tree in the mountain.

975
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,720
Because its wood

976
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,120
can't be made into any artifacts,

977
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,600
it survives

978
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,480
under the axe of a logger.

979
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,840
Therefore, Zhuangzi said,

980
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,320
everyone knows useful,

981
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,840
but does not know the useless.

982
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,120
In fact, those things

983
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,560
that seem to be

984
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,520
useless,

985
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,720
as long as we change the angle,

986
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,720
we will find its precious value

987
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,120
just like finding the big tree

988
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,720
that is useless.

989
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,000
In today's fast-paced

990
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,640
era,

991
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,840
each of us is trapped

992
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,240
by utilitarian desires

993
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,120
and overwhelmed by the cruelty of competition.

994
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,120
We are educated that time is limited.

995
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,480
Striving is life.

996
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,440
We are asked

997
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,520
to stay away from useless things

998
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,320
and not to lose our minds.

999
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,560
But is this really the fact?

1000
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,720
When I was young,

1001
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,600
I could not read

1002
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,720
extracurricular books that were not related to study

1003
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,640
because they could not add a point

1004
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,880
to my exam paper.

1005
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,200
But it has increased my knowledge

1006
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,520
and broadened my horizons.

1007
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,200
When I went to university,

1008
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,240
I couldn't join

1009
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,000
various clubs

1010
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,920
because they couldn't solve

1011
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,840
my employment problem.

1012
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,240
But it is the most precious memory

1013
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,440
in my limited youth.

1014
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,800
Listening to music and watching art exhibitions

1015
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,600
can't make me earn a penny more.

1016
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,760
But the pursuit of art

1017
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
and beauty

1018
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,400
makes my spirit happy and free.

1019
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,240
Therefore, my fellow debater,

1020
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,320
the useless is the usefulness from another point of view.

1021
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:22,840
Thank you.

1022
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,600
Are there a lot of loopholes

1023
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,720
in this argument?

1024
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,520
This is not loophole.

1025
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,240
This is their ambition.

1026
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,280
If we concentrate on this,

1027
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,440
there must be

1028
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,760
many strategies waiting for us.

1029
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,800
If we don't speak,

1030
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,280
we will definitely feel suffocated.

1031
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,320
That's right.
