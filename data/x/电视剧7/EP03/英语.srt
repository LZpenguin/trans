Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP03

2
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,800
What are you doing here?

3
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,800
oh

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,560
I scared you.

6
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,880
It's okay.

7
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
What happened to you, Dango?

8
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,840
Xiaoyu

9
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
What's wrong?

10
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm in trouble.

11
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,520
It's alright.

12
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,520
Why did you borrow it online?

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,520
I have money.

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
Why don't you borrow from me?

15
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,080
Except for Jiebei,

16
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
did you use other apps to borrow money?

17
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
I also used 360 IOU,

18
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
Xiaomi.

19
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,280
Dango

20
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,680
These are formal loan apps.

21
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,000
Didn't you borrow

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,480
from some unreliable ones?

23
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,000
There is also a network platform.

24
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,280
I didn't want to use it actually.

25
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,480
But it says

26
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,040
no guarantee or mortgage is required.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,520
The money arrives in one minute.

28
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,160
I didn't think so much.

29
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,200
I used it.

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Unexpectedly,

31
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,120
he just came to collect debts.

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Tell me how much money you borrowed.

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
I borrowed

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,960
30,000.

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
What did you buy?

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,880
I didn't buy anything.

37
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,280
Everything I bought is quite cheap.

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Who knows if it adds up...

39
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Are these online loan platforms

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
legal?

41
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,760
Can we sue them?

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,160
Calm down.

43
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,960
They're not illegal and they don't force you.

44
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,560
How can we sue them?

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
It's good that they didn't sue you for overdue.

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:07,720
Dango

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
When will you pay back the money?

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,440
Otherwise, the profits will get higher and higher.

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,120
Then you can't pay it back.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,040
Tomorrow

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,320
Xiaoyu, I'm afraid.

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,840
All right.

53
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,680
Don't be afraid.

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm here with you.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,200
It's already like this.

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Let's pool the money together.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,800
Let's pool the money together.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
You can start now.

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,320
You go first.

60
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
God must be punishing me.

61
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,960
Don't say that, Dango.

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,280
It's you!

63
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
In accordance with the Supreme People's Court trial

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,960
on issues related to

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
the application of law

66
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,080
in private lending cases,

67
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,840
if the annual interest rate exceeds

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,560
36%,

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,560
the exceeding part

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,760
is invalid.

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
It means that

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
they lend usury.

73
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
The illegal part

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
doesn't have to be returned.

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,720
That's right.

76
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
According to the agreement signed by Dango and the platform,

77
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
the annual interest rate is 20%.

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,000
Overdue interest is continuous compound interest.

79
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,840
If we calculate it like this,

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,960
the money of Dango is

81
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,920
thirty-five point

82
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:35,720
nine percent.

83
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,600
It's short of 0.1%.

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,320
It doesn't belong to usury and can't be sued.

85
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,080
Are they so insidious?

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,880
Can't it be rounded?

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
No.

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,560
They are just

89
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,400
fooling little girls like you.

90
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,120
Whether the appearance

91
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,520
or psychology

92
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,720
are easy to be fooled.

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,120
Ah...

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
You're a sophomore.

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
Are you professional enough?

96
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
I am a talented student in law department.

97
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,320
You ask me if I'm professional.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,480
Have a look.

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
Business license, tax registration certificate

100
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,040
and organization code and witnesses are shown here.

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,040
Their qualifications are complete.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,760
On the national credit information

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,360
publicity platform,

104
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,480
the relevant information can also be found.

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,920
In this way,

106
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,960
Dango can't pay less.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,240
She has to pay it back.

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,680
Hello

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Are you Mu Xiaoyu?

110
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,200
Xiong Zishi has already

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,080
lost contact for several days.

112
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,360
You tell her to

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
contact me as soon as possible.

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Who are you?

115
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,600
Are you her classmate?

116
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
She owes me a sum of money.

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
It's overdue for a long time

118
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,240
but she didn't pay me back.

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
If she doesn't deal with it,

120
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,520
we have to take some measures

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,560
to collect it.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,400
All right.

123
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,680
I know.

124
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,960
Why are they calling

125
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,680
me?

126
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,440
They ask me to fill in

127
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,880
three emergency contacts,

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,440
but I dared not fill in my parents.

129
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,960
I fill in you,

130
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,360
Hao, and Fanfan.

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,840
If they come here,

132
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,240
then the whole university will know.

133
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,240
At that time,

134
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,520
Liu Yanze will know it, too.

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,480
Xiaoyu, what should I do?

136
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,040
Dango

137
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
It's not a small number.

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,160
You should call home.

139
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,280
Call home?

140
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,840
Dango's dad,

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,560
her dad is not easy to deal with.

142
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,360
My dad has been a supermarket security guard

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
for 13 years.

144
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
In addition, he usually

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,680
likes to watch criminal investigation dramas.

146
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,760
There is no thief he can't catch.

147
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,120
There is no theft that he can't solve.

148
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,400
And no one can

149
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
lie in front of him.

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,440
People always call him

151
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,520
Di Renjie of the department store.

152
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
So if he knows

153
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,120
I've got into such a big trouble,

154
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
he will...

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,600
He will...

156
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,240
Hey,

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,480
your dad is so good.

158
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,400
Why are you afraid of usury?

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm afraid of my dad.

160
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,280
And this time I did something wrong.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
Maybe he will

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,320
kick me out...

163
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,200
At that time,

164
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,160
I'll be alone.

165
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,760
I have no money to rent a house.

166
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
I can only

167
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,000
find a man to marry.

168
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,120
Then I'll get married without the bride price.

169
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
My father can't attend my wedding.

170
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,880
My mother-in-law will look down on me.

171
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,520
Dango

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,680
You tell the family.

173
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,760
It is inevitable to have a fight.

174
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,840
But you have to tell your family now.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,720
At least you can solve

176
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,520
the current problem.

177
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,960
No way.

178
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
I've had my dad

179
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,000
help me with many things.

180
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,160
Now I'm in college.

181
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,640
I need to learn to be independent.

182
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
I can't ask teachers and parents for help

183
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,160
in everything.

184
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,800
Right?

185
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,680
It's only been a few days.

186
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,880
The interest rate has rolled so high.

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,000
I still have some balance in my card.

188
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,880
Let's pay it back first.

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,000
If the interest is

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
a few hundred yuan, it won't be so difficult.

191
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,440
But except for

192
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
the cheating loan,

193
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,200
she has extra

194
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,280
debt of more than 30,000 yuan.

195
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,600
Even if it is a formal lending platform,

196
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,000
it's not a small amount

197
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,880
to go on like this.

198
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,880
Now time is really money.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
An extra moment

200
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,640
can't even delay.

201
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,480
Anyway,

202
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,960
we have to pay off the debts first.

203
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,360
How about a part-time job?

204
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,880
Where I used to work part-time

205
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,800
is 120 yuan a day.

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,160
There are still three thousand a month.

207
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
It's been too long, Hao.

208
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,200
Ah...

209
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Do you remember

210
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,640
what I told you before,

211
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,680
the Fast Unloading Application.

212
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,640
I have signed up for

213
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,400
the Campus Entrepreneurship Program.

214
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,280
The teacher said there was a chance.

215
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,760
When the plan

216
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,960
is handed in,

217
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,400
financing is not a problem.

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't say 30,000.

219
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,760
300,000 is OK.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,080
Are you serious?

221
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,920
When?

222
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
In a year or a half year or more...

223
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,520
I...

224
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,560
The plan hasn't been handed in yet.

225
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,600
What did I say?

226
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,520
I knew a junior.

227
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,720
She writes papers on the Internet.

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,280
Stop.

229
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,440
Hao

230
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,440
That's academic fraud.

231
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,600
Don't talk about that.

232
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I think she should

233
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,040
ask her family for help.

234
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,200
The more we drag on, the more troublesome it is.

235
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
I agree with Nan Bei.

236
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
It's right.

237
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
But it's impossible for Dango.

238
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,840
Does she have a bad relationship with her parents?

239
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,360
Very good.

240
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,400
It's just that Dango has been

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
naughty and mischievous.

242
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,040
Her mother has been helping her with the aftermath.

243
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,520
And her parents...

244
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,920
In order not to let her get into trouble again,

245
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,960
they are very strict with her.

246
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,160
Dango always wants to

247
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,080
establish an independent

248
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,040
image.

249
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,880
If her parents know about this,

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,640
I don't know what they will do to her.

251
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Dango, drink some water.

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,400
OK.

253
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm sure everyone must have done

254
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
adequate preparation.

255
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,520
So who can solve

256
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,680
today's topic?

257
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,800
I can!

258
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,920
It's really broken.

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Let's read the topic first.

260
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
College life...

261
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,520
In fact, universal cognition

262
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,000
can solve the question.

263
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,680
Then there are self-discipline and heteronomy.

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,800
This is a comparative question.

265
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,760
I think

266
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,480
these two should be

267
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,360
a relatively large battlefield.

268
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,280
One

269
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,880
is the definition of self-discipline and heteronomy.

270
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,240
Then the more important is criterion.

271
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,160
Nan Bei, let me add.

272
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,120
College life is the premise of the topic,

273
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
combined with the topic stem.

274
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
The space we discuss

275
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,640
is relatively large.

276
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,880
Because we're in

277
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,200
a special time period.

278
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,960
Although we are already

279
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,800
adults,

280
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,800
we're still in the environment

281
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,680
like more than a decade ago.

282
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,640
We are familiar with it.

283
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,640
We are still in the college environment

284
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,880
where the children are.

285
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,920
This state

286
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,080
has an impact on self-discipline and heteronomy.

287
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,800
It should be what the questioner

288
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,760
wants us to discuss.

289
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,400
Yes.

290
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,440
When

291
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,560
I started college,

292
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,040
I just thought

293
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,160
I didn't get out of bed for three days and three nights.

294
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,800
At that time, I thought...

295
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,280
Eh...

296
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,920
You don't go to the bathroom.

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,680
Can you stop interrupting?

298
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,160
As a boy, I think

299
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,640
staying up all night, playing games

300
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,480
and watching the live broadcast or something

301
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,160
are normal.

302
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,720
I just feel like

303
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,440
I get out of

304
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,360
the control of parents.

305
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
I should enjoy it.

306
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,160
Yes.

307
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,360
When I was a freshman,

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,320
I also want to play everything.

309
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,760
With the girls in my dormitory,

310
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,040
we practice makeup all night.

311
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,680
I don't expect a girl to

312
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,520
go to the counter

313
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
as a part-time makeup artist.

314
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,920
I won't say it.

315
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,160
I still can't

316
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,840
control my mouth.

317
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,920
So

318
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,320
does the control of parents belong to heteronomy?

319
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,800
So the lack of heteronomy

320
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,160
will result in the loss of self-discipline.

321
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,760
No.

322
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560
Heteronomy will cause

323
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,520
binding gap.

324
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,400
Self-discipline didn't fill in.

325
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:31,960
Right.

326
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,160
Because we have been

327
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,120
under control since we were young.

328
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,080
There is no

329
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
self-discipline at all.

330
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,400
There is no opportunity for self-discipline.

331
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Where is the loss?

332
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,640
I think

333
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
we don't realize that

334
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,440
no one cares about us now

335
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
means what.

336
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,320
Nobody caring

337
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,920
means that

338
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,480
no one will cover for you again.

339
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,440
There won't be anyone else

340
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,720
to bear this for you.

341
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,320
Every time

342
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,280
I shop online crazily,

343
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,560
when I see my favorite things

344
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
and overspend again and again,

345
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,080
and even when I see the lending platform

346
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,240
and click in,

347
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,640
I never think too much.

348
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,720
I naively thought that

349
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
everything

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
could be solved.

351
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
In fact,

352
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,400
I've been under Dad's protection for too long.

353
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
I don't realize that

354
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,400
the price is so cruel,

355
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,320
so real,

356
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,400
and so troublesome.

357
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,800
So what is our Dango

358
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,680
going to do?

359
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,760
I should face it.

360
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,840
Hello

361
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,320
dad

362
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm in trouble.

363
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,720
Hey,

364
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,840
can you see?

365
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,240
The man walking towards

366
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,000
the school building

367
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,320
is Dango's father.

368
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,840
Dango's father is really cool.

369
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,280
As for the image of Dango's father,

370
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,880
if he's not a special soldier,

371
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,040
he can play gangster movies.

372
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,360
It will get a score of nine in Douban.

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,480
Am I right?

374
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,680
Where is Dango?

375
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,840
Where does Dango go?

376
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,680
Oh, my God.

377
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,480
Dango runs away.

378
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,520
Are you Xiong Zishi's father?

379
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm Dango's...

380
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm Zishi's friend.

381
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
She is not in the dormitory.

382
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,320
So where did she go?

383
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,800
I should have thought of

384
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
her father's deterrent to her.

385
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Wicked girl

386
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
She cops out at the last minute.

387
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,440
Think about it.

388
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,360
Where the hell can she go?

389
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,960
It's not the way to escape like this.

390
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,040
It seems that

391
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,120
Nan Bei has to hold Dango's dad.

392
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,520
Let's go and look for her again.

393
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,520
When will Dango come?

394
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,640
She was supposed to be here,

395
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,880
but she was called away by the debate teacher.

396
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,920
She will be back soon.

397
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,840
Really?

398
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:06,920
Yes.

399
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,320
Have you ever heard of a study?

400
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,520
When someone tells a lie,

401
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
his eyeballs

402
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,800
will move to the upper right corner of the eye socket.

403
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,600
Really?

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Did you realize that

405
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
your eyeballs move?

406
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
Guess which way it's moving.

407
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,040
Uncle, you are so humorous.

408
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,960
Where is Dango?

409
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,960
She was called away by the teacher.

410
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,680
This time your eyeballs

411
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,880
don't move.

412
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,520
But

413
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,120
if a person is too anxious,

414
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,280
his hands will unconsciously

415
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,840
move.

416
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,880
For example, you.

417
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,720
Are you nervous?

418
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,680
What are you worried about?

419
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,720
Let me get you a glass of water.

420
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,240
Sit down.

421
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,600
You really don't see Dango, right?

422
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,040
I really don't see her.

423
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,960
I'll tell you if I see her.

424
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,520
The idea of supplementing sugar

425
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,280
is wrong.

426
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,960
Where can she go?

427
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
Where else can she go?

428
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,560
So stupid.

429
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
Hao, come with me.

430
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,160
uncle

431
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,800
This lamp...

432
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,960
Gender?

433
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,680
Eh...

434
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:48,920
male

435
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,960
Age?

436
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,880
Nineteen.

437
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,240
Height.

438
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,280
1.78 meters.

439
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,960
Family status?

440
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,720
I,

441
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,040
and my parents.

442
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,800
Three people.

443
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,480
What is the relationship between you and Dango?

444
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,920
Ordinary friend.

445
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,840
What else?

446
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,840
We are still debate friends.

447
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Last night

448
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,280
Dango called me.

449
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,720
She said she got into trouble.

450
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,080
She says she will tell me what kind of trouble

451
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,120
when we meet.

452
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,800
Do you know

453
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,280
what she does?

454
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,480
In other words,

455
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,680
what did you do to her?

456
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,600
I didn't do anything.

457
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,800
What do you want to do?

458
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,240
This...

459
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,040
It's better for Dango to tell you.

460
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,960
So you did.

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,480
I didn't do anything, uncle.

462
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,440
Isn't it painful to lie?

463
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,160
Are you suffering?

464
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,400
Say it.

465
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,960
It won't be so painful.

466
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,840
Uncle, I tell you everything.

467
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,560
I tell you.

468
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,960
Eh...

469
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,280
When I was in the first grade of primary school,

470
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,480
I didn't do my math homework once.

471
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,080
Because

472
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,120
Wang Ergou of the next door

473
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,960
came to play with me.

474
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,920
Then I forgot to write because I was too tired.

475
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,200
But I told the teacher that

476
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,040
Wang Ergou came to me.

477
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,880
And I got the wrong homework.

478
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,960
After I said it,

479
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
I realized how stupid I was.

480
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,000
When Wang Ergou saw me,

481
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,880
he exposed me directly.

482
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,080
My mother beat me up.

483
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,200
In the second grade,

484
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,360
I lied to Wang Ergou.

485
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,240
I asked him to

486
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,840
put his tongue

487
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
on the frozen water pipe

488
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,480
for thirty seconds.

489
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,160
And then you

490
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
could taste the rainbow.

491
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,640
As a result, he

492
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
stuck for thirty minutes.

493
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm not on purpose.

494
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,440
I'm not on purpose.

495
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,320
Teacher

496
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,280
Excuse me.

497
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,840
Is Xiong Zishi here or not?

498
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,600
She came here ten minutes ago.

499
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,440
She said she was dizzy.

500
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
She's resting inside.

501
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,600
Oh,

502
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,440
thank you, teacher.

503
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,160
I told her before.

504
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,000
During military training,

505
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,040
Nan Bei pretended to be sick.

506
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,960
She looked

507
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,080
deeply inspired at the time.

508
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,840
She's hiding here now.

509
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:13,720
OK.

510
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,600
Dango

511
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,960
Xiaoyu

512
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
Am I useless?

513
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,720
Your father is as fierce as Lv Bu.

514
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm afraid, too.

515
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,880
My father will scold me seriously.

516
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,000
You don't even know

517
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,880
how frugal he is.

518
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,320
If he can take a bus,

519
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,800
he won't take a taxi.

520
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,480
He never takes a bus if he can walk.

521
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,960
If he knows

522
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,640
I spend money like this,

523
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,320
he will be furious.

524
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,160
Dango

525
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280
Do you remember

526
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,880
how we

527
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,760
became friends?

528
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,120
When I was a child,

529
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,040
I always fought with boys.

530
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,240
For a long time,

531
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,200
neither boys nor girls

532
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,280
liked to play with me.

533
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,960
Only you

534
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
can eat with me,

535
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,880
go to school with me,

536
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,360
and play with me.

537
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,160
You have been like this since you were a child.

538
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,560
Like is like.

539
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,520
Hate is hate.

540
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,120
Do whatever you want to do.

541
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,120
I actually hope

542
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,240
you can always be like this,

543
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,440
like a little girl who never grows up.

544
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,080
But now I think

545
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,560
my idea is quite selfish.

546
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,880
I think the college

547
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
creates an illusion for us.

548
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,240
It seems that

549
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,440
we are all children.

550
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,320
We don't need to face society.

551
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,120
We don't have to face the outside world.

552
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,640
We forget that

553
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,960
in the real world,

554
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
no matter what you do,

555
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,960
you need to bear the consequences

556
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,120
yourself.

557
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,920
Dango

558
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,480
As a friend,

559
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
I solemnly tell you.

560
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,440
Don't evade

561
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,760
the responsibility you should bear.

562
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,840
So

563
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,080
you'd better look up bravely.

564
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,720
Go to bear the mistakes in front of your father.

565
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,320
Otherwise,

566
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,200
as your best friend,

567
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
I'll force you to come.

568
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,120
Because this is my duty

569
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,960
as your best friend.

570
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,040
When I was a freshman,

571
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,400
I sewed Mengyuan's unwashed socks

572
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,680
into the pillowcase of Dandan.

573
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,120
He hasn't found out

574
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,440
where the smell came from for a month.

575
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,640
You finally come.

576
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm about to talk about my sophomore year.

577
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
I'm sorry, Dad.

578
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,000
I really know that I was wrong this time.

579
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,480
What's up?

580
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,600
I don't know

581
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,840
how I spend so much.

582
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm careless.

583
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm unconscious.

584
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,480
Then I spend more than I can afford.

585
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,160
I used

586
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,440
Taobao,

587
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,880
JD.com,

588
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,600
and a few Baitiao.

589
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,720
My classmates have helped me

590
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,920
collect eight thousand yuan.

591
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,880
They help me pay back the internet loan.

592
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,560
How much is it altogether?

593
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,440
More than 30,000...

594
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,720
More than 30,000.

595
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
It won't happen again.

596
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,720
I won't.

597
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,560
It won't happen again.

598
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
Send me

599
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,920
your bank card number.

600
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,560
And

601
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,320
call all your classmates

602
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,000
in

603
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,240
and stop lying down at the door.

604
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
It's uncomfortable.

605
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,480
Tell them that

606
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,600
I invite everyone to have a meal.

607
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,600
OK.

608
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,200
Thank you, Dad.

609
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,200
Let's go.

610
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,640
Come on.

611
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,280
Thank you, uncle.

612
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,520
Thank you for inviting us to have a meal.

613
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,080
You're welcome.

614
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
Please take care of

615
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,360
Dango in the future.

616
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,040
Then

617
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,080
we'll go first.

618
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,680
I have a competition tomorrow.

619
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,280
And I need to train.

620
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,640
Eh.

621
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,080
OK.

622
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,920
You can do your business first.

623
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,680
I'll talk with Dango for a while.

624
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,280
Ah.

625
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,400
Thank you, uncle.

626
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,840
Goodbye.

627
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,240
See you later.

628
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,200
See you.

629
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:39,840
Dango

630
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,440
Let's sit over there for a while.

631
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,320
OK.

632
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,240
Come here.

633
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:45,720
OK.

634
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:50,960
Ah.

635
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:54,840
Dad

636
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,560
What?

637
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,040
This time,

638
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,440
I'm sorry.

639
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,800
Daughter,

640
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,040
in the future,

641
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,720
no matter what happens,

642
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,440
you have to tell dad.

643
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,520
Do you understand?

644
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:07,880
Yes.

645
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,600
Dad,

646
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,640
does my mom know about this?

647
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,720
Don't let your mother

648
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,320
know about this.

649
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,240
Then where do you get the money?

650
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
This is Dad's private money.

651
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,000
Cool, dad.

652
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,600
OK.

653
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,560
Daughter,

654
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,040
you prepare well

655
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
for tomorrow's competition.

656
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,840
Come on.

657
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,920
Okay, then I'm leaving, dad.

658
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,320
OK.

659
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,440
Dad,

660
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
thank you.

661
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,440
Bye, dad.

662
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,480
Ah...

663
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,040
It's time to quit smoking.

664
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,440
After eating together,

665
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,200
I don't think

666
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,120
Dango's father is so scary.

667
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,200
No.

668
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,240
I am still scared

669
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,960
when I see her dad.

670
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,080
I think it's a pity

671
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,040
that uncle has such a skill

672
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,280
as a security guard.

673
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,600
My dad has left

674
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,800
that department store.

675
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
He comes to a security company,

676
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
and becomes the director.

677
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,440
In short,

678
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,640
the dust has finally settled.

679
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,040
Everybody now

680
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,960
can prepare for the debate without any burden.

681
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,600
Let's start preparing for the debate.

682
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
Hello

683
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,240
Look

684
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,360
what I brought you.

685
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,360
Are you exhausted?

686
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,240
Let's replenish our energy.

687
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,000
And then let's continue to practice.

688
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,600
Come on.

689
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Thank you, Hao.

690
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:26,880
That means

691
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,640
you can tell everyone about

692
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,840
the ones you omitted just now.

693
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,600
Let's talk again.

694
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,000
OK.

695
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,800
Excuse me.

696
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,320
Tao Hao

697
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,840
Oh?

698
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,280
Hao,

699
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,840
what is the situation?

700
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Tell us something about it.

701
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,960
Senior,

702
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,400
I have a boyfriend.

703
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,320
What does it matter to me?

704
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,800
You are talking about this.

705
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,440
These flowers are that

706
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,280
the school office teacher doesn't want them.

707
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,240
I think about taking them back for decoration.

708
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,440
Oh.

709
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh.

710
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,480
This is senior Ma Nan,

711
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,200
who belongs to the student union.

712
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,280
We've bought shoes together.

713
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,840
Men may meet but mountains never.

714
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,560
Senior, you come here today...

715
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,440
Oh,

716
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,120
wait a minute.

717
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,680
Take a look at this.

718
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,200
Come on.

719
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,640
This is a portable foot soaking bucket.

720
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,520
It's easy to carry and ready to use.

721
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,000
It helps protect the liver and resist fatigue.

722
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,640
The man can use it to keep fit.

723
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,200
The woman can use it to maintain beauty.

724
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,600
You come to us to sell things.

725
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,160
Are you sure?

726
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm doing this for

727
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,080
collecting tuition.

728
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,520
Twenty yuan each.

729
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,160
Only for sale but not for free.

730
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,880
Let me give you a 15% discount.

731
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,640
Tell you

732
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,040
it's really suitable for you.

733
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,520
Young people who stay up all night while soaking wolfberry.

734
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,560
How about it?

735
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,040
This is not necessary.

736
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,160
What do you think?

737
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,920
What if the other side says that

738
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,560
self-discipline needs to overcome

739
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
the inherent inertia of human nature?

740
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,800
It is a difficult thing

741
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,440
with a low profit ratio.

742
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,960
What to do?

743
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,520
Then I say

744
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
the long-term benefits of self-discipline are higher.

745
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,800
The key is that

746
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,160
people can do without saying the profit ratio.

747
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,400
For now,

748
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,800
the difficulty of overcoming laziness

749
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,200
is definitely higher than heteronomy.

750
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,480
Heteronomy

751
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,680
is a more effective method.

752
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,160
Then we won't be affected.

753
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,480
Can we go around?

754
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,080
How to go around?

755
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Heteronomy itself is a kind of laziness.

756
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,200
What are you saying?

757
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,200
Isn't heteronomy lazy?

758
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,440
It is the laziest.

759
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,640
That makes sense.

760
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,600
Ah...

761
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,400
If self-discipline

762
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,640
needs to overcome laziness,

763
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,640
heteronomy

764
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
is a kind of laziness.

765
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
It's definitely easier

766
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,120
to be pushed by someone

767
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,440
than to climb a mountain on your own.

768
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,560
So...

769
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,320
Heteronomy,

770
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,480
to some extent,

771
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,400
doesn't even have to choose the direction.

772
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Because others

773
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,040
have already chosen it for you.

774
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,480
If you look at it this way,

775
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
for college students,

776
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,520
the more important

777
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,320
is laziness.

778
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,720
We go around.

779
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
This point is too sharp.

780
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,920
Have you played

781
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,640
a debate before?

782
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,280
Where is he?

783
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,280
Audience friends,

784
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,920
good morning.

785
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,720
Good morning.

786
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,120
Welcome to today's

787
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,280
DUFE news program.

788
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,160
Today's main contents are as follows.

789
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,760
Mr. Li arrived at the branch campus

790
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,600
for an official friendly visit

791
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,120
to the students.

792
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,360
The 26th meeting of the student union

793
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
was held in dormitory 113.

794
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
Dormitory 343 and 502

795
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,320
are conducting joint military exercises.

796
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,640
The competition between the Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics

797
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,480
and the Western University of Science and Technology

798
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,560
debate teams

799
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
will kick off today.

800
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,240
Please see the detailed report below.

801
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,080
Sit down.

802
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,000
I'll sit here.

803
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,520
You sit here.

804
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,080
Welcome to today's

805
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,120
debate.

806
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
Let's first get to know

807
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,720
the positive side.

808
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,080
Their view is that

809
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,240
self-discipline is more important in college life.

810
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,640
Let's welcome them.

811
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,360
And the opposite side

812
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,400
is made up of

813
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,040
the brilliant star of national competition last year.

814
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,320
Yin Nan serves as the second debater.

815
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,080
Dongzhou star debater,

816
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,600
Liu Yanze is the captain.

817
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,280
They are the opposing side.

818
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,360
Their view is that

819
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,720
heteronomy is more important in college life.

820
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,760
And let's

821
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,960
give them applause.

822
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,040
Why doesn't she introduce us?

823
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,080
Do you have any good grades

824
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,160
in college?

825
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,880
They are professor Chen Ji,

826
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,920
professor Min Ruiwu,

827
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,840
professor Guo Xinggang,

828
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,760
and professor Zhao Hongxia.

829
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Let's welcome them.

830
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,640
At the same time,

831
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
students from Dongzhou City

832
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,120
Debate League

833
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,600
serve as technical judges in this competition.

834
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,440
Let's also

835
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,920
give them applause.

836
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,120
Now I declare that

837
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
the debate officially starts.

838
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,560
Let's enter the argument session of both sides.

839
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,000
Three minutes for each side.

840
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,400
In the meantime, the other side has the right to question.

841
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
The time is one and a half minutes.

842
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Let's start with

843
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,720
the positive side.

844
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,360
Please

845
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:28,760
Thank you.

846
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,880
Hello, everyone.

847
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,520
Our view today is

848
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,440
self-discipline is more important in college life.

849
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,480
How should we

850
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,320
understand this sentence?

851
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,320
College life is a special stage,

852
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,880
from the campus to the society.

853
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,960
This is also a critical period

854
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,760
for us

855
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,600
to cultivate our own capabilities.

856
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,400
Therefore, the so-called importance

857
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,000
will also be different

858
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,960
due to the particularity

859
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,800
of this stage.

860
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,280
The definition is so biased.

861
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,480
This is to seduce us to raise objections

862
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,760
to launch the first battlefield.

863
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,200
Question us.

864
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,320
Come on.

865
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,680
Yin Nan

866
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,960
Come on!

867
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,920
Xiaoyu

868
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
I support you.

869
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,640
You're

870
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,120
my good friend.

871
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,880
Then what is more important?

872
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,880
We believe that

873
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,560
because the ability to focus on training

874
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,280
is different

875
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,040
at different stages of life,

876
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,840
what

877
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,480
needs more energy

878
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,560
to learn and cultivate

879
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,440
at this stage

880
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,400
is more important.

881
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,640
Compared with heteronomy,

882
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,520
self-discipline is obviously

883
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,360
the shortcoming

884
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,400
of most college students.

885
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,120
Therefore,

886
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,120
This point...

887
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,680
Let's ask the second debater of the opposing side

888
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,920
to raise a question about this.

889
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,160
The time is one and a half minutes.

890
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,560
I want to confirm it.

891
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,680
Which one do you think

892
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
requires more time and effort

893
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
is more important, right?

894
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,200
It's okay to understand in this way.

895
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,600
Do you need to spend a lot of time and energy

896
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,800
to make money?

897
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,080
Generally speaking, yes.

898
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,920
Breathing usually doesn't require

899
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,760
a lot of time and energy.

900
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,640
According to your logic,

901
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,120
money is more important than breathing. Right?

902
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,600
It's absurd.

903
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,480
My fellow debater,

904
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
this is an inappropriate comparison.

905
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,600
Breathing usually doesn't require

906
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,320
a lot of time and energy.

907
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,080
But self-discipline needs to

908
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,920
be learned and cultivated.

909
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400
This is an inappropriate comparison.

910
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,600
What about inappropriate comparison?

911
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,960
One can be missed and the other can't be missed.

912
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,840
Doesn't it show

913
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,600
the importance?

914
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,680
This is not the point.

915
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,360
What we have been stressing is that

916
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,320
self-discipline requires learning.

917
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,120
OK, let's say another example.

918
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,600
I can't make up.

919
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,600
But I can eat.

920
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,440
So for me,

921
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,520
makeup that needs to be learned

922
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,200
is more important

923
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,000
than eating that doesn't need to learn.

924
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,880
Don't you need to learn to eat?

925
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,320
Do you use chopsticks

926
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,720
when you are born

927
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,480
or use knives and forks?

928
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
When I was a child, my parents chased me

929
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,560
to tell me to eat.

930
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,680
So whether it is important or not,

931
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,560
we have to consider the urgency.

932
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,480
For example,

933
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,360
if I'm going on a date now,

934
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,480
makeup is more important.

935
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,320
So, urgency

936
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,280
equals importance, right?

937
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,240
Skip the standard.

938
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,280
Our judgment criteria are very comprehensive.

939
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,280
Of course, the urgency

940
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,600
is taken into account.

941
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,120
Marriage is

942
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,880
not very urgent for me.

943
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So in my life,

944
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,240
is marriage not important?

945
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,600
This...

946
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,960
She's stuck.

947
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
Solving urgent problems

948
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,520
and the urgency of problems

949
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,360
are two different things.

950
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,800
Let me summarize.

951
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,120
The standard of positive side

952
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,040
jumps from time and effort

953
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,800
to urgency.

954
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,200
It's always unconvincing.

955
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,160
She also fails to justify herself.

956
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,360
And our standard is

957
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,320
between self-discipline and heteronomy,

958
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,320
what can help us grow

959
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
is more important.

960
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:06,920
Thank you.

961
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,760
Yin Nan's operation

962
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,120
disintegrates the opponent's standards.

963
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,000
Very good.

964
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,160
OK.

965
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,040
Next,

966
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,200
I'll continue to expound our view.

967
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,440
University

968
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,360
is our first step

969
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,920
towards adult life.

970
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,880
It is also the first time

971
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,560
to learn...

972
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,920
Their team looks quite strong.

973
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,440
Can Nan Bei control the situation?

974
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,560
What do you mean?

975
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,440
It means

976
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,840
Nan Bei lost that part.

977
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,640
Do you really not understand?

978
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,440
Therefore, we firmly believe that

979
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,280
self-discipline is more important in college life.

980
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:41,880
Thank you.

981
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,800
Let's welcome the first debater of opposing side to argue.

982
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,640
Thank you.

983
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,720
Hello, everyone.

984
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,000
Our view is very simple.

985
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
Whether it is self-discipline or heteronomy,

986
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,120
what can effectively help us

987
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,720
grow

988
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,760
is the most important.

989
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,160
The other side's argument consists of three arguments.

990
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,440
Adults need to be more self-discipline.

991
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,960
The standard of self-discipline is higher than that of heteronomy.

992
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,160
So it is more conducive to growth.

993
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,800
And the cost of losing self-discipline

994
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,560
is more serious.

995
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,720
It's clear.

996
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,400
It depends on whether you can defend it or not.

997
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,760
We lost a section in argument.

998
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,560
Hope Nan Bei's cross-examination

999
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,080
can save a little bit of the situation.

1000
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,240
Let's go to the cross-examination session.

1001
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,200
First of all, please ask the second debater

1002
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,880
to cross-examine

1003
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,440
the opposing side.

1004
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,040
Please.

1005
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,440
It is emphasized in your argument that

1006
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,920
the effect of self-discipline

1007
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,720
is not as good as heteronomy. Right?

1008
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,040
The fourth debater

1009
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,880
Yes.

1010
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:35,920
Ancient slaves

1011
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,800
relied on heteronomy,

1012
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,880
and yeomen relied on self-discipline.

1013
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,800
Which effect is better?

1014
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,240
The third debater

1015
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeoman.

1016
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,920
But the restraint of slaves

1017
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,520
cannot be regarded as heteronomy.

1018
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,360
It is compulsory.

1019
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,400
OK. So

1020
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
what is forced is not heteronomy,

1021
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
but what is willing

1022
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,880
is heteronomy.

1023
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,600
Shouldn't this be called self-discipline?

1024
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,640
Go back to your argument.

1025
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,240
What do you think is the biggest resistance

1026
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,200
to self-discipline?

1027
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,760
The fourth debater

1028
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,880
Self-discipline needs to overcome

1029
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,720
a lot of resistance.

1030
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,720
For example, we are born to be lazy.

1031
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,720
No.

1032
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,040
Nan Bei can't

1033
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,840
form an effective attack

1034
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,600
on Liu Yanze.

1035
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,760
Get around him.

1036
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
But relying on others

1037
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
to manage your heteronomy

1038
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,360
is lazy itself. Am I right?

1039
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,680
The first debater

1040
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,680
Yes.

1041
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,280
But what's wrong with being lazy?

1042
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,800
From the telegraph, telephone to the Internet,

1043
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,800
from cars and ships

1044
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,360
to airplanes and high-speed rail,

1045
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,960
learning to be lazy correctly

1046
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,440
is simply

1047
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,920
the first productive force that promotes progress.

1048
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,560
Why does the first productive force

1049
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,360
become a resistance

1050
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,200
on your side?

1051
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,560
The third debater

1052
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
This issue is not related to today's debate.

1053
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,640
Serial sophistry.

1054
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,200
No logic is normal.

1055
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,800
The other side didn't react.

1056
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,960
Over-reliance on heteronomy

1057
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,960
cannot develop the habit of self-discipline.

1058
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,480
What shall we do?

1059
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,800
When you are riding a bike,

1060
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,600
your father has been holding you.

1061
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,560
You can never learn well. Am I right?

1062
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:33,960
The fourth debater

1063
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,520
If my dad doesn't hold me,

1064
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,600
I may not even dare to step onto the bike.

1065
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,800
This is what we emphasize.

1066
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,880
Heteronomy is the premise and foundation

1067
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,720
of self-discipline.

1068
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,840
In this case,

1069
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,320
heteronomy is the father of self-discipline.

1070
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,080
Will we say

1071
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,440
father is more important than son?

1072
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:47,920
The first debater

1073
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,480
No.

1074
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,240
But this has nothing to do with

1075
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,040
our debate.

1076
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,560
If we say heteronomy

1077
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,320
is the father of self-discipline,

1078
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,360
why is heteronomy

1079
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,920
more important?

1080
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,320
It seems to

1081
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,000
save the competition.

1082
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,400
If we can survive

1083
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
the next cross-examination,

1084
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,240
the situation will be balanced.

1085
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,480
The fourth debater

1086
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,480
Do you think

1087
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,160
for adults

1088
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,680
self-discipline is more important than heteronomy?

1089
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,280
Yes.

1090
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,080
But

1091
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,720
we think...

1092
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,560
Then since heteronomy

1093
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,400
is not so important,

1094
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
why is the law

1095
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,560
stricter on adults

1096
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
than on minors?

1097
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,160
The third debater

1098
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,720
Because many of us

1099
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,200
didn't form the good habit

1100
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,440
of self-discipline in college.

1101
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,040
For example, don't interrupt others' speeches

1102
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,000
at will.

1103
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,960
The kindergarten teacher

1104
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,640
should have taught it.

1105
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,720
The interrogator can interrupt.

1106
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,280
This is my right

1107
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,120
given by the rules of the debate.

1108
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,000
My fellow debater

1109
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,920
lacks respect for heteronomy.

1110
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,640
This may be

1111
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,040
the crux of your point of view.

1112
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,360
With the so-called

1113
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,520
self-discipline at kindergarten level,

1114
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,800
it's self-empowerment actually.

1115
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,840
You are talking to yourself and singing your own praises.

1116
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
It seems a little childish.

1117
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,960
You point out that

1118
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,560
standard of self-discipline

1119
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,520
is higher than heteronomy. Right?

1120
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,880
The third debater

1121
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,720
If it's the same thing, yes.

1122
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,600
Why? The first debater

1123
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,080
Because heteronomy is often the bottom line.

1124
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,040
For example, the school rules

1125
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,800
stipulate that I go to class at eight o'clock.

1126
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,360
This is heteronomy.

1127
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,360
But the rules I give myself

1128
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,200
is half past eight.

1129
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,000
Then how can I

1130
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,840
call it self-discipline?

1131
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,680
This is not self-discipline.

1132
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,160
Is there no self-discipline

1133
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,150
lower than heteronomy?

1134
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,500
The fourth debater

1135
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,120
No.

1136
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,120
For example, the criminal example

1137
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,920
you just cited.

1138
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,640
Their self-demand

1139
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,440
is lower than the law.

1140
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,800
It can't be called self-discipline, right?

1141
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,720
If my parents ask

1142
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,880
me to take the first place in my class,

1143
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,960
but I want to

1144
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
be in the top ten.

1145
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,160
Is it the standard of self-discipline

1146
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,480
lower than heteronomy? The third debater

1147
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,000
Parents have great ambitions for their child.

1148
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,680
It is

1149
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,480
unreasonable heteronomy.

1150
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,000
So

1151
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,880
your argument

1152
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,800
is that reasonable self-discipline

1153
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,480
is more important than

1154
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,240
unreasonable heteronomy.

1155
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,280
Can we

1156
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,000
also argue that

1157
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,120
reasonable heteronomy

1158
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,880
is more important than

1159
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,640
unreasonable self-discipline?

1160
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,880
She knows that Xiaoyu is used to fighting back.

1161
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,280
She's luring Xiaoyu to foul.

1162
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,920
So does your arguments

1163
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,560
also include

1164
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,400
unreasonable heteronomy?

1165
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,120
Do you have to

1166
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,240
accept

1167
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
all the so-called heteronomy that treats others strictly?

1168
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,440
Attention please.

1169
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,000
The side being questioned shall not ask.

1170
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,080
Thank you.

1171
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,760
I'm so stupid.

1172
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,160
I lost the technical points.

1173
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,080
Yin Nan is too sinister.

1174
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Two main arguments

1175
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,360
are breached.

1176
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,560
Not good.

1177
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,600
This round

1178
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,400
is ours.

1179
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,720
If Nan Bei loses

1180
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,040
in the next round of defense,

1181
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,920
I am afraid there is really no chance.

1182
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,480
Don't worry.
