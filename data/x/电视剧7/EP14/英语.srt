Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP14 

2
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,160
Do you remember

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,400
the words you told me this afternoon,

4
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,360
lady will do makeup for someone who loves her.

5
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,160
Is that common?

6
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,680
It depends

7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,120
on how you define the relationship of you two.

8
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,680
Based on my experience,

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,000
girls are always right.

10
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,240
If you want to ask her out,

11
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,560
then you have to admit mistakes.

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,800
I don't say that I want to ask her on date.

13
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,600
En?

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, I do have a good feeling on her.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,640
Just good feeling?

16
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,680
I have a crush on Mu Xiaoyu!

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,480
What?!

18
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,680
I...

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,760
I said, I have a crush on Mu Xiaoyu!

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,360
I knew it!

21
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,080
I knew it!

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,320
When did it happen?

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
I have no idea.

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,040
It just happened.

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,920
Maybe...

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,640
I just had good feeling on Mu Xiaoyu.

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,360
What?!

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,160
What did you just say?

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,640
I said,

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,160
I love Mu Xiaoyu.

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,200
Wow!

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,800
I have been waiting this news for a whole year!

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,400
My little brother finally grow up!

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
So does Xiaoyu know about this?

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
You guys also saw the situation this afternoon,

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,680
this girl maybe

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
has some problems on

38
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
her feeling.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,920
Quite so.

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,720
That's exactly her.

41
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
But, never mind,

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,840
I will help you.

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Help him what?

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
For god's sake,

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,200
can you guys don't show up together?

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,720
I said I like Mu...

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,560
I...

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,800
I...I said I like...

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,240
like...

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,240
What do you like?

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,880
Tripe.

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
I like eating tripe.

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
Come on!

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,080
You are surely not talking about this.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,160
Why they have these expressions?

57
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,720
Tell me.

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,760
Nothing, never mind.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,280
Let's eat!

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Let's eat, Xiaoyu.

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,800
You guys spoke ill of me, don't you?

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
It tastes nice!

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,880
Hey,

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,360
look,

65
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,320
Will I look nice

66
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,560
if I put on makeup?

67
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,880
Let's try.

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,800
You two have pretty face anyway,

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,640
you will look perfect.

70
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,000
I think so.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,240
I finish.

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Great!

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,640
There is still smell, Sis Hao.

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,400
What a pity,

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,320
like Nan Bei said,

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,760
Although I put on makeup,

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
nobody appreciate.

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,280
That words don't sound like a feminist said.

79
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,200
Putting on makeup or not,

80
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
we do it for ourselves.

81
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,240
You have watched this video for a thousand times,

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
you still watch it?

83
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
No matter how many times,

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,160
this part

85
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,280
still moves me a lot.

86
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,320
Look,

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,920
I say,

88
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,760
best friends become lovers,

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,720
which is unreal.

90
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,040
Personally,

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
somebody

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
are afraid of losing friends,

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,600
so

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
they hesitate to express their feeling.

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,840
Somebody

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,920
enjoy the feeling of dating with girls

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,560
in romantic air,

98
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,320
pretending a naive boy to the end.

99
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,280
Actually,

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,040
one chases love,

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,440
perhaps he won't lose friendship.

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,040
Nietzsche said,

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,160
It is not a lack of love,

104
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
but a lack of friendship

105
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,320
that makes unhappy marriages.

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
So love and friendship

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,160
can coexist.

108
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,800
Even sometimes,

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,280
love and friendship

110
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,040
can be better when they coexist.

111
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,800
Xiong Zishi,

112
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,520
you barely read books,

113
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,160
how can you

114
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,520
say so philosophical words?

115
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,640
I...

116
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,600
I am a bluffer of love.

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
So,

118
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
putting on makeup,

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,240
give it a try?

120
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,920
Well?

121
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
I don't know how to use this,

122
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,680
how much shall I use?

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,200
Too much...

124
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,240
Do you know how to use this, Sis Hao?

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
I learn how to use it

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
from a teaching video for a long time.

127
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
We have makeup club in our college,

128
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,920
how about you go to join it?

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
They will teach you some easy makeups.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,360
Speaking of which,

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,760
they will hold an activity tomorrow morning.

132
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,320
Great, Xioayu!

133
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,400
We can go together,

134
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,240
maybe,

135
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
you can impress someone.

136
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,760
Huh...

137
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
There are really so many girls

138
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
wasting their time here!

139
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,680
Shut up, come on.

140
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,600
Hello,

141
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,320
excuse me,

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,400
may I ask

143
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,520
who will give the class?

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,800
Our club chief.

145
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,320
You two must be new here.

146
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Our chief is so great,

147
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,880
she is a famous beauty blogger

148
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
who has over two million fans!

149
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,040
Ok, thank you.

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,920
It is worthy of coming!

151
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,240
Luckily we borrow staff from Sis Hao.

152
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,800
Two million fans...

153
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,680
so this chief doesn't do other things?

154
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,280
En?

155
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,840
Oi...

156
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
Giving up before start,

157
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,600
it's just so you.

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,520
Clam down...

159
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,960
Ok,

160
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
Let's begin

161
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,240
our class.

162
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
Qin, come here.

163
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,640
Today,

164
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,520
we will teach you

165
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,480
how to make

166
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,120
eyebrows fitting yourselves.

167
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,160
Before this,

168
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,280
we shall do a review

169
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,040
on the last class,

170
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,200
which is how to make matte finish.

171
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,440
First, we need to choose

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,360
a foundation one shade

173
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,920
lighter than our skin tone,

174
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,080
spurt evenly on your face.

175
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,440
Then use this

176
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,520
half-wet sponge

177
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,440
rolling spread.

178
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,720
After that,

179
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
we use powder to finish the makeup,

180
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,000
put it on our skin gently.

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,440
Well, next,

182
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,480
we will learn how to pencil our eyebrows.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
Our eyebrows are second important

184
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,200
during the whole makeup

185
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,360
following eye makeup.

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,920
A good camber

187
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,760
can also

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,120
modify the shape of face,

189
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,080
including round face.

190
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,240
Me?

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,800
First of all,

192
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,200
We need to take

193
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,960
our eyebrow shaver out

194
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
to shave

195
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,400
our surplus hair

196
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,280
beside our eyebrow.

197
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,960
Look where the top of eyebrow is,

198
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,480
maintain its original shape.

199
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,640
Everyone, let's try.

200
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,920
Ask me when there are questions.

201
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
If it's your first time,

202
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,200
you can use tweezers

203
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
in case you make mistakes.

204
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,400
May I help you?

205
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,320
You are not that warmhearted.

206
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,000
If you make yourself look like a monster,

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
and people see you,

208
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,960
my reputation will be ruined.

209
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,320
I just want to be judged by your mistakes.

210
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,280
Uh!!!

211
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,520
You did this on purpose!

212
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,920
You are twenties,

213
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,720
but never shave your eyebrows,

214
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
how you can live on without this?

215
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,000
Who said that I never shave my eyebrows?

216
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
I am just too busy

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
for serious matters.

218
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,880
You are also not doing well in

219
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
your serious matters.

220
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,600
Well,

221
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,880
so much for today,

222
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,600
you can use mirror

223
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,120
to find out which eyebrow shape

224
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,960
fits you perfectly.

225
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,920
Why are you laughing?

226
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,480
Are you making fun of me?

227
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,400
A teacher makes fun of student?

228
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,160
Xiaoyu, easy...

229
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
How dare you make fun of me?

230
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,280
Why you stop me?!

231
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,040
Easy, easy.

232
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,840
One with great power cannot defeat a local villain.

233
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,360
How about

234
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,040
have a rest and take a meal?

235
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,480
Xiaoyu.

236
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,720
Let's eat together?

237
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,600
We had taken our meal,

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,400
sorry.

239
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,280
Really?

240
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,800
Yep,

241
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,640
Yep.

242
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Then why are you

243
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,160
showing your back to me?

244
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,840
I am not.

245
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
Are you feeling bad with your eyes?

246
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,960
My eyes are...

247
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,040
fine.

248
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:45,760
Look.

249
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,360
Why are you blocking your eyebrows?

250
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,720
I'm not.

251
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,080
Why I block my eyebrows?

252
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,840
I just wanna

253
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
take a good picture

254
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,000
in this beautiful day.

255
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,040
Such a nice day!

256
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,720
Uh!

257
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,840
Ah!

258
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,800
What a nice day!

259
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,000
Take a posture first.

260
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,440
I am fine,

261
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,000
really.

262
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,520
So you don't need to go to see a doctor?

263
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,200
Definitely not.

264
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,320
Let me see, what's wrong?

265
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,760
No, thanks.

266
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,480
Let me see.

267
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,840
No.

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,400
Let me see...

269
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,920
No!

270
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,720
I turn my words back,

271
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
natural beauty fits you.

272
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
You can learn from me!

273
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,880
I am a beauty guru.

274
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,800
So are you?

275
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,480
Yep.

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,840
You don't know?

277
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,560
Here,

278
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,240
let me show my account.

279
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,040
Only 500 followers?

280
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,320
Even I have more.

281
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,320
I, am not good at

282
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,440
doing homework,

283
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
or study,

284
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,880
so I just find a hobby

285
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,560
for myself,

286
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,480
besides,

287
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560
they are my die-hard fans.

288
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,160
Let me teach you two?

289
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,760
I don't wanna study,

290
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,680
nor learn to put on makeup.

291
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,320
No!

292
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,240
Xiaoyu, you have such a pretty face,

293
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,560
you will look so nice after doing makeup.

294
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,080
No,

295
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,320
I am so happy that I don't put on makeup.

296
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,760
Wrong, Xiaoyu.

297
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,360
Think about it,

298
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
You can't let Yin Nan look down on you.

299
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,040
Right?

300
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480
In her eyes, you,

301
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,680
both of us

302
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
are just two

303
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
college students lacking taste in life.

304
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,760
Can you bear it?

305
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,080
No!

306
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,120
That's right.

307
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,800
Qing, please teach us!

308
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
Teach us some quick skills.

309
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,640
No problem.

310
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Actually, wearing makeup is much easier

311
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,080
than study.

312
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,480
You two can use

313
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,800
some skin cares to moisturizer your skin.

314
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,040
I fetch you some samples.

315
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,720
Use skin care first

316
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,040
to moisturizer your skin.

317
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,920
Here,

318
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,880
here you are.

319
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,520
Here you are.

320
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,840
This, you can use this.

321
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
Fanfan, you use one?

322
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,960
No, thank you.

323
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,600
Before I become a doctor,

324
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
I don't wanna waste my time on

325
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,520
wearing makeup.

326
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,360
How is it wasting your time?

327
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,800
When I don't put on makeup,

328
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,120
I feel I am common,

329
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
but after I wear makeup,

330
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,840
I feel like that

331
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,160
I look like a film star.

332
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Wearing makeup has a hypnotic effect.

333
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
This confidence,

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
will fade with cleansing.

335
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,080
So you would better read more books.

336
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,120
What you are holding?

337
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,760
This is a foreign exchange event,

338
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
which Mr. Li asked me to

339
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
give a speech on behalf of our grade.

340
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,400
Good, then.

341
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,120
Oh,

342
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,480
I send you a video about

343
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,240
how to put on makeup.

344
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,320
You two can check it up.

345
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,320
Ok!

346
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,720
Got it!

347
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,680
Dear leaders,

348
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,080
teachers and students,

349
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,880
good morning!

350
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,160
I am Ji Fanxi, 

351
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,800
a student from

352
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,720
Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics.

353
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
how is it going?

354
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,760
Don't worry, Mr. Li,

355
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,760
I am well-prepared.

356
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,240
Relax,

357
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,960
just share your study

358
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,360
in our

359
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,240
university

360
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,040
with freshman.

361
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
You shall look energetic then.

362
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,120
Energetic?

363
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
Yes, just wear little makeup, and dress up.

364
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Is there any problem?

365
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,440
No, no.

366
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,560
So I have to put on makeup?

367
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
Just a light makeup

368
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,160
to make people feel you

369
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,000
are very energetic,

370
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,240
full of power.

371
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,000
Energetic...

372
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,080
Two years in college fly away,

373
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,760
looking back on the year I entered this college,

374
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,000
the most important thing is

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
to find a goal

376
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,840
during our four years of college life.

377
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,960
As you can see,

378
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,040
I have multiple identities.

379
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,200
Well,

380
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
actually,

381
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,640
after I diverted to

382
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,280
model,

383
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,000
it has been two years that

384
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,600
I don't make money as a model.

385
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,360
Hey, why Xiaoyu

386
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,520
puts on makeup suddenly?

387
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,120
Oh?

388
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Are you showing off?

389
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,560
No, no, no...

390
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm just confused.

391
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,880
Can't you see?

392
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,920
But,

393
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,000
she resisted this last day,

394
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,920
why she changes her mind today?

395
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,840
She does it for you.

396
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,760
Really?

397
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,240
Well...

398
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,240
If you say so,

399
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,000
she does have a feeling about me?

400
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,400
Then why she is so bashful?

401
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,520
You just don't have experience in love.

402
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,440
You two are good mates,

403
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,760
good friends.

404
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,320
Once something goes wrong,

405
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,320
you two even can't be friends anymore,

406
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,040
not to mention debate match.

407
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,600
If something goes wrong,

408
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,280
I will try my best to

409
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,360
maintain our friendship.

410
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,200
Nothing to be afraid.

411
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,240
You can do that.

412
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,560
But Xiaoyu maybe doesn't have this confidence.

413
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,320
Then I can make her have one,

414
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,920
problem solved.

415
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,640
Fine.

416
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,720
Hey, bro!

417
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,080
Your posture is wrong,

418
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
let me help you.

419
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,320
Yong lady,

420
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,960
this makeup suits you so much.

421
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,440
Sister,

422
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,440
this is a nice makeup,

423
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,520
but,

424
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,640
can you put it on my whole face?

425
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
We only do half face for trying out.

426
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
If you wanna buy our makeup,

427
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
I will make up your whole face.

428
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,560
The price is...

429
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,680
Then I shall cleanse it.

430
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,240
Then I recommend you

431
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
our latest cleansing,

432
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,040
which takes...

433
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,760
cleanse it.

434
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,680
Alas...

435
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,520
So,

436
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,320
what we will train today is...

437
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,600
There is no game to prepare for.

438
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,360
The basic training is finished.

439
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,320
And atmospheric pressure is also relatively low.

440
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,360
And it's bad weather.

441
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,360
Alas...

442
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,760
So let's go?

443
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,720
Ok.

444
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,840
Ok, I will go to sleep.

445
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,000
Stop! What's going on?

446
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,000
What's wrong with you guys?

447
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,560
If you have this attitude,

448
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,120
how can I face

449
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,800
our old coach

450
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,840
who can just stand up?

451
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,280
Right, Hao?

452
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,080
Yep.

453
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,760
How about

454
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,320
starting an inside debate now!

455
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
The topic...

456
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,920
is that...

457
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,720
lady will wear makeup for someone who loves her,

458
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,440
or for herself.

459
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,760
I believe for someone who loves her.

460
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,960
Great! I disagree.

461
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
Then...I agree with him.

462
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,800
You boys

463
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,560
just evolve too slowly!

464
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,280
Then I shall use truth

465
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,960
to give you a lesson,

466
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,560
ok?

467
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Yes, please!

468
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
How to punish the loser?

469
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
How about livestream putting on makeup on TikTok?

470
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,640
Good.

471
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
I will give you a thumbs up then.

472
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,560
We will see!

473
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
I have best debater!

474
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,240
Ok?

475
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,120
I..didn't say I'm in...

476
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,200
Bro...

477
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,240
Let's begin!

478
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,080
Ok!

479
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,600
Let's begin!

480
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,240
Ok!

481
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,760
Let's start!

482
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,200
Let's begin!!!

483
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,960
Ok!!!

484
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Great!

485
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,080
I like your

486
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,880
energy.

487
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,360
Finished.

488
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Look,

489
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,720
I said,

490
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,600
I am a real

491
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,240
beauty blogger.

492
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,320
Look how beautiful you two are!

493
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,160
Look great, Qing.

494
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,240
I can't make the decision.

495
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,520
These three lipsticks,

496
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,280
which color do you think

497
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,720
fits

498
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,480
my clothes?

499
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,480
For what?

500
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,040
Nan Bei said he

501
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,720
will help a guy from Department of Astronomy.

502
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,320
They will take photos of starry sky,

503
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,120
so he asked me to go with him.

504
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,840
Romantic!

505
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,680
Is he asking you to go out with him?

506
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,640
Nonsense!

507
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,040
He just can't handle this himself

508
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,800
so he asked me to help him.

509
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,640
How about first one, the crimson one?

510
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,560
This one?

511
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,920
Will it be too red?

512
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,080
I gave it a try,

513
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,400
see.

514
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
Then the pink one in the middle?

515
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,520
I have a comparison,

516
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,800
this pink,

517
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,320
won't it reflect light at night?

518
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,960
Look.

519
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,600
You really go to help him???

520
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,040
What?

521
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,080
Don't tell me

522
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
you agree with the con side.

523
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,280
I don't.

524
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,560
I just provide

525
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
strong evidence for us.

526
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I just

527
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
go to gather some information.

528
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,720
I heard that

529
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,280
Nan Bei likes grapefruit color.

530
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,880
Then I will take this one,

531
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,040
I also think that this color is nice.

532
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I will use this.

533
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,400
Can you handle this?

534
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,240
Why this

535
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,000
tripod just can't

536
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,720
be fixed?

537
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,400
Look at me,

538
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,600
what's different today?

539
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,200
You bought new clothes?

540
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,560
I have worn this for whole semester!

541
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,080
Look closer.

542
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,560
What?

543
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,600
I used a grapefruit color lipstick.

544
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,240
Does it look good?

545
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,600
Do...do you wanna drink milky tea?

546
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,560
I...I go to buy you one...

547
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,240
I'm asking you question!

548
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
Why are you leaving?

549
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Beautiful!

550
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,600
Yep.

551
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,600
What are you looking at?

552
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,920
I...

553
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,840
I...

554
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,200
I believe that you are cold.

555
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,200
I'm not.

556
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,000
You are.

557
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,640
You must be cold.

558
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm not,

559
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm not.

560
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,560
Just wear this.

561
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,600
What are you doing?

562
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,160
Watching makeup teaching video.

563
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,680
You watch this every day.

564
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,640
It's Fanfan's computer,

565
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,680
she forgot to shut it down.

566
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,360
And more,

567
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,400
this also belongs to Fanfan.

568
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,480
She begins to put on makeup?

569
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,160
There is more,

570
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,160
This is also hers.

571
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,880
She doesn't wear high heels.

572
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,600
Maybe she...

573
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,560
No way,

574
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,040
she said that

575
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,040
she will never date with someone until being a doctor.

576
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,920
A friend from student union

577
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
told me a thing

578
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,640
which can explain these.

579
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,680
What are you doing?

580
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,040
We wanna help you

581
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,280
put on makeup.

582
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,600
For what?

583
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,920
I never do makeup.

584
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,200
You will deliver a speech,

585
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,240
of course, you need to look nice.

586
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,800
How do you know about this?

587
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,200
I...

588
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,120
Don't hesitate,

589
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,840
we know the whole thing.

590
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,720
This is heel band-aid,

591
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,160
It's your first time to wear high heels,

592
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,240
your feet will swell without this.

593
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,640
Here you are.

594
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,640
Thank you, guys.

595
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,440
Never mind, we are sisters.

596
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,360
Come on, sisters,

597
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,080
Let's do this!

598
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,440
Wait a minute!

599
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
I...I am nervous...

600
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,560
Don't worry,

601
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,360
close your eyes,

602
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
we will finish in minutes.

603
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,080
Well...

604
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,400
Look,

605
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,680
is it good?

606
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,400
Beautiful girls, handsome boys,

607
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,000
in a good atmosphere.

608
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,000
The losers' faces

609
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,080
with makeup

610
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
will be put on the board.

611
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,320
But this team game,

612
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,640
you can't act like last time,

613
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,240
you need to maintain the principle of

614
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,280
friendship first, competition second,

615
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,840
Is that clear?

616
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,320
- Uh...- En?!!!

617
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,040
We are ready.

618
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,040
Good.

619
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,320
Well,

620
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,440
great thank to

621
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,840
President Zhang and Dean Wang

622
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,920
for their speech on

623
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,040
music Festival.

624
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,360
The next,

625
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,160
welcome the outstanding student representative

626
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,640
from DUFE,

627
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,520
Ji Fanxi

628
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,800
who will give us a speech with

629
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,440
the topic of memories.

630
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,040
Welcome.

631
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,320
Dear leaders,

632
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,040
teachers, and students,

633
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,240
good morning!

634
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,960
I am Ji Fanxi,

635
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,760
 a student,

636
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,800
from DUFE.

637
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,360
I am so delighted to

638
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
meet with everyone.

639
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,360
I...

640
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,880
regret to announce

641
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,840
the result of this game:

642
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,760
the winner is

643
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,440
pro side, Xiaoyu team.

644
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,640
The makeups

645
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,920
are ready.

646
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,080
We are waiting for your livestream on TikTok.

647
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,920
I suddenly remember that I shall go for a class...

648
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,760
Students are waiting...

649
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,800
Stop.

650
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
You have no class at all this week.

651
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,320
Your job of student union

652
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,560
was all rearranged by me.

653
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,560
So you three

654
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,400
just sit down

655
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,960
and livestream here.

656
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,080
So the sooner, the better.

657
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Wait,

658
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,120
I wanna say a word,

659
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,440
well...

660
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,320
if you don't wannna

661
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,640
wear makeup, then don't.

662
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,480
Because you are beautiful

663
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,240
without any makeup.

664
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,160
Well...

665
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,720
You can't escape.

666
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,800
Come here.

667
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,600
The Earth has six billion people,

668
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,720
one can meet a thousand people a day,

669
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,480
 and 365 thousand people

670
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,280
in a year,

671
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,040
29.2million people

672
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
in his life.

673
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,800
So the probability of

674
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,920
meeting is

676
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,440
We meet so much people in our life,

677
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,280
but the probability of falling in love is pretty low.

678
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
You take film elective course,

679
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
why have I accompany you?

680
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,880
Just for watching movie?

681
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
Last week I came to class,

682
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,440
I found he also takes this course.

683
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,600
Everyone,

684
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,080
don't be disappointed,

685
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,760
Although the probability

686
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,920
is low,

687
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,040
have you found out that

688
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,160
there are many

689
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,120
lovers or couples

690
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,360
around us.

691
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
And why is that?

692
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,240
Because

693
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,800
long long ago,

694
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,280
a great great invention

695
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
solved this problem

696
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,160
which is this.

697
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,640
It sounds like a pyramid scheme.

698
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,040
Does she have an

699
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,920
apple orchard?

700
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
The next words she gonna say may be

701
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,240
apple is a panacea.

702
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,840
In some ancient myths,

703
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,720
we human

704
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,400
have experienced love

705
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,320
between man and woman

706
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,000
through an apple.

707
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,560
So,

708
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,920
if you receive an apple

709
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,800
from a boy

710
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,760
in the eve of the new year,

711
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,680
guess what,

712
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,040
this doesn't mean good luck,

713
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
but wanna date with you.

714
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Date...

715
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,360
Understand?

716
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,080
Today is a festival,

717
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,920
but you are still so quiet.

718
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,800
I have grown up,

719
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,680
realizing there are more serious things

720
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,720
in this world,

721
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,360
except dating.

722
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,920
Have I mentioned date?

723
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
We are sisters for years,

724
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,440
I know what you gonna say

725
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,520
before you say.

726
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,000
Hello, give you an apple.

727
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,840
Wow! You!

728
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
It's wasting my apple.

729
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,680
What are you talking about?

730
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,280
Wait,

731
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,680
what are you doing?

732
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,440
Uh...

733
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
My God!

734
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,960
You look nice,

735
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,720
but please don't do

736
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,680
this nasty thing!

737
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,560
You don't get it,

738
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,240
it's a present for girls.

739
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,200
Have you asked

740
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,320
our opinion?

741
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,200
Do you know why girls

742
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,960
don't wanna fall in love?

743
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,920
Because we don't wanna

744
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,080
date with someone like you!

745
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,040
Show love to every girl.

746
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,760
We can watch movies,

747
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,600
play games,

748
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,520
enjoy desert,

749
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,000
we will never spend time

750
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,560
on an asshole like you.

751
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,480
I...

752
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,200
Good!

753
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,560
Uh...

754
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,440
I...

755
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Our college is

756
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,680
a national key university.

757
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,600
But the thoughts of boys

758
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,680
are too shaky.

759
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,200
Is it related to

760
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,880
their records?

761
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,960
Just like human,

762
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,320
it is gender difference.

763
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,920
Not all, right?

764
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,760
What do you mean?

765
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,320
I do a divination for you,

766
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Your love fortune is good this week.

767
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,720
A boy who has had a crush on you

768
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,520
for long time

769
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,240
will profess his love for you.

770
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,240
Come on, witch Xiong.

771
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,400
This is feudal superstitious,

772
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,800
ok?

773
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,680
If you have time,

774
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,760
you shall think about our debate.

775
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,840
You are not interested,

776
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,640
then I won't speak.

777
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,320
You don't say, then I want to know.

778
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,040
I won't say!

779
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,640
Say!

780
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,080
No!

781
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,320
Say!

782
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,840
No!

783
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,160
Please tell me.

784
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,840
Well,

785
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,560
look,

786
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,760
that's him.

787
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,720
Though Nan Bei

788
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,840
is not tall or handsome,

789
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,960
and annoying,

790
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,360
compared with that asshole,

791
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,600
he is much better.

792
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,720
You shall wait and see!

793
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,480
But he sometime is

794
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,360
unmanly.

795
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,680
You can shut up,

796
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,040
and wait.

797
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,560
You can laugh out.

798
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,280
Look,

799
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,240
everything goes fine...

800
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,920
Look, Xiaoyu,

801
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,200
He is hiding his feeling...

802
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Nonsense!

803
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,760
Go back to train!

804
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,400
Let's go.

805
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,520
Xiaoyu.

806
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,760
What's wrong with her?

807
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,320
Nothing.

808
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
I told you,

809
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,640
he is hiding feeling.

810
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,920
It must be from Nan Bei.

811
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,360
Dango,

812
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:16,960
here you are.

813
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,880
Sis Hao,

814
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,720
these apples are yours?

815
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,120
Yep.

816
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,400
Everyone can have an apple

817
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
for vitamin supplement.

818
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
Do you do wholesale now?

819
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,120
I didn't buy these,

820
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,600
don't know what's going on today,

821
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,280
many junior male schoolmates gave me apples.

822
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,680
There are animal plagues recently,

823
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
unstoppable spreading,

824
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,760
I suggest you don't eat it.

825
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,960
Are they

826
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,640
relevant?

827
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,480
Of course.

828
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,080
Siberian cold rages,

829
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,720
taking plagues to

830
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,200
west apple plain,

831
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
the biggest apple

832
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,240
producer in the world.

833
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,080
Almost all apples

834
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
in this season

835
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,800
are from there,

836
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,400
so don't eat it.

837
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,720
Sounds like unreal.

838
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,480
It's washed, eat it.

839
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,600
Nan Bei,

840
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
do you know,

841
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
the meaning of

842
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,640
giving apples today?

843
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,320
Yes,

844
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,040
wish you are safe.

845
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,240
My children,

846
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,240
happy New Year!

847
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,040
Why you have so many apples?

848
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
school staff benefits.

849
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,760
I can't move it

850
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,640
back anyway.

851
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,040
Then,

852
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,520
we will divide these,

853
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,000
how are you preparing?

854
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,080
I am waiting to give

855
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,120
update to our coach.

856
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,360
Do you read newspaper today?

857
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,400
That luck fortune shows

858
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,160
that today is not good for study.

859
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,560
Being lazy

860
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,600
can have a reason?

861
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,400
Fine,

862
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,640
what's your plan for the festival?

863
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,400
Right,

864
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
it is festival,

865
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,720
we surely can't go to dormitory

866
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,680
to sleep.

867
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,680
Yep.

868
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,080
How about going to KTV?

869
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,520
Let's check up...

870
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,840
They are all ordered.

871
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,080
How about hotpot?

872
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,400
Hotpot...

873
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,200
The costs are equal to

874
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,040
four or five make-up examination fees.

875
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,480
Concert?

876
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,360
Right,

877
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,080
tonight,

878
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,480
there is Jingfei's concert.

879
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,040
Yes!

880
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,480
Surely, there are no tickets.

881
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,760
Let's go to see fireworks?

882
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,000
Ok.

883
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,640
That's ok.

884
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,760
Deal.

885
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,440
Ok, you can go.

886
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,480
You don't come?

887
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,240
I already have arrangement.

888
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,080
En?

889
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
Do what?

890
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,240
Work overtime.

891
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,160
Work makes me happy.

892
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,080
Then we can go to People's Square

893
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,480
which has less building surrounded,

894
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,040
bigger place,

895
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,800
and we can shoot off fireworks.

896
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,160
Then,

897
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,680
we can go to buy it.

898
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,720
En...

899
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,560
Nan Bei?

900
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,920
I am not available this afternoon.

901
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,520
You can go,

902
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,520
sorry.

903
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,240
Now that the night is yet to come ,

904
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,440
we can

905
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,880
make good use of our time,

906
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,440
let's train!

907
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,000
What?

908
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
Ah...

909
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,120
There is still one day,

910
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
instead of being mad now,

911
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,840
you should think about

912
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,680
how to make it difficult

913
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,880
when he professes to you.

914
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
How do you know that?

915
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,440
Certainly.

916
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,080
Wise people

917
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,400
can tell.

918
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,680
Look,

919
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,320
the eve night,

920
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,560
with fireworks over whole sky.

921
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Why are you laughing?

922
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,360
What will you do in a while?

923
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,040
Go to dormitory.

924
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,640
My comic club has activities later,

925
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,400
so I will go there.

926
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,160
Then see ya.

927
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,680
See ya.

928
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,960
No apples,

929
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,720
but give me stupid pears?

930
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,480
Bro shui,

931
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,520
I know that

932
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,360
our drinks don't suit you,

933
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,920
you can bring the fruits to squeeze the juice.

934
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,320
It's for Nan Bei.

935
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,040
Even ducks have apples!

936
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,680
Mengyuan gave ducks apples.

937
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,040
Hey, what are you doing?

938
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,240
I'm busy now,

939
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,120
I'll call you later.

940
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,520
Hey!

941
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,200
Nan Bei!
