00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,500
Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP20

2
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,960
Considering our current situation,

3
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,840
we must win eight competitions

4
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,160
within two weeks

5
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,840
to enter

6
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
the provincial competition.

7
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,000
The first problem is

8
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,440
the games are all

9
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,560
held in the suburbs.

10
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,120
We can't even get there easily.

11
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Maybe,

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
we can train to be ninja

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,280
and teleport ourselves.

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
Or maybe we can look into

15
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,040
lotteries

16
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,760
and win a car.

17
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,200
There are ways.

18
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,880
Look at the game held on the day after tomorrow

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,520
in the east of the city.

20
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,120
We have

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,640
85 minutes

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,320
until the next one.

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,960
We can take the crowded

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,920
Bus No. 621.

25
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,080
After 28 stops,

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,040
run across

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,600
complex Yingli Park.

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,240
Next, get on Line Alpha

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,040
which is overcrowded.

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Hurry up, Hao.

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,360
Finally,

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
scuttle to the hall

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,360
in five minutes.

34
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,880
You're 20 minutes late

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,840
and disqualified.

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,720
Let's worry

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,400
about that

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,760
when we get there.

39
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,480
Our mission today

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,440
is not finished.

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm sorry

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,200
we have to stay up.

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm so sleepy.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,520
Take a break.

45
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,360
Jeez, what is that?

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,480
Come down.

47
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,160
Sa.

48
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,080
Where did you

49
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,280
find this piece of trash?

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,840
How much is it?

51
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,600
Less than 20 yuan?

52
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,200
Let's take the subway.

53
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,360
This thing will be

54
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,280
a cultural relic soon.

55
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,280
This

56
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,160
is old, I know.

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
But at least it has four wheels.

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,440
Right?

59
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Our schedule

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
is getting tighter.

61
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,160
We can't waste our time on the road,

62
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,560
right?

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,320
Yeah, it looks cool to me.

64
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,200
At least we can sleep a bit

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,000
on the way.

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,120
Yeah.

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,840
we can also get

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,200
takeaways

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,560
to eat normally.

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,240
That's right.

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,000
Sa,

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,160
where did you

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
get the car, and how much was it?

74
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
There's a used car market

75
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,560
nearby.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
You can get a car right away.

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,760
And I

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,680
have a little deposit.

79
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,640
And,

80
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,320
I asked for three months' salary

81
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,920
in advance to buy it.

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,320
It's burning.

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,160
Get in now.

84
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
We're getting late. Hurry.

85
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,480
Go.

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,080
Let's go!

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,040
Sa,

88
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,360
l, I'd like to know

89
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,320
if you have a driver's license.

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,600
Of course, I do.

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,760
Don't worry.

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
It, it's new.

93
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,000
I need to get used to it first.

94
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
New?

95
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,280
What's new?

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
Sa, I can drive, too.

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,560
Why don't you let me drive?

98
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,600
Sa, is the fuel nearly used up?

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Mother Earth, nice to see you again.

100
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,720
Jeez.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Hold on.

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,200
The winner is

103
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,800
team 235.

104
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,320
The winner of this competition is

105
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,960
team 235.

106
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,080
Let's congratulate

107
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,400
team 235 on their victory.

108
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,040
It's impossible.

109
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,560
Even 5G has been

110
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,040
popularized.

111
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,080
I don't need five.

112
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
Just give me one.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Hey.

114
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,760
There're single people here.

115
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,080
Keep it to yourselves.

116
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm just

117
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,440
trying to be a good boyfriend.

118
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,800
Okay?

119
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,240
Great progress!

120
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,200
Do you feel hot?

121
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,880
No, I'm actually a bit cold.

122
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,760
Why do I feel somewhat sweaty?

123
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,360
Do me a favor.

124
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
Put it on.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu.

126
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,680
Well,

127
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,040
aren't you tired like this?

128
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,320
No. I don't want to get off.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
Just try it.

130
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Nan Bei!

131
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,680
None of your phones have service?

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,160
We are three points away

133
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
from the admission.

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,680
The game is approaching.

135
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
The upcoming contests

136
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
are crucial to us.

137
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
There are three games left.

138
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,080
Two of them are overlapping.

139
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
The other one

140
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
is a tripartite debate.

141
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,520
But our opponent is team one.

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Not them again.

143
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,440
Hao, what is a tripartite debate?

144
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm new to it.

145
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,760
It's a debate held

146
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
between Party A, B, and C.

147
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,840
The process

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
is similar to that of an ordinary debate.

149
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,320
But two of the parties

150
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,040
can join hands against the third one.

151
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,960
I'm not working with team one.

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
In the end,

153
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,320
if the third party

154
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,520
finds some loopholes,

155
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,880
things can be tricky.

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,560
There're only three points to go.

157
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,520
Let's not risk it.

158
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,200
Just avoid them.

159
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,520
Fight them later.

160
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,400
You've finally grown.

161
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,680
That's right.

162
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,080
One of the two overlapping games

163
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,320
is called the Edge Cup

164
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,920
The topic is

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,000
"Should we do something not encouraged?"

166
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
It's a B-class game

167
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,160
we signed up for.

168
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,560
Even if we win,

169
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
we get only two points.

170
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,040
Only two points?

171
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,320
That does not make a big difference.

172
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,680
Should we drop out?

173
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
What about the other one?

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,880
It's held by Luojia College

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
on "Should the debate topic

176
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,800
be made into films and TV dramas?"

177
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
It offers three points.

178
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,960
- That's it. - That's it.

179
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,880
Also,

180
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,360
I like this topic.

181
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,560
Under the present world view,

182
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,160
such topic is like

183
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,200
a destiny.

184
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
Then let's get ready.

185
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,840
I know

186
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
that we've been working hard recently.

187
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
Go back and rest well tonight.

188
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
It's a deal then.

189
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,360
Let's rest like we mean it.

190
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,200
No one thinks about debating today.

191
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,360
Don't worry, Hao.

192
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm tired enough

193
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
to pass out right away.

194
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,560
Dango.

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
You're awake, too?

196
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
Yeah.

197
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,880
At least Qing is not here,

198
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,840
so I can sleep in your room.

199
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,720
Our room

200
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,560
is probably having a tea party.

201
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,000
Hao, are you asleep?

202
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
No.

203
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,440
Hao,

204
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,280
I gave the topic

205
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
some thought.

206
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
This topic sounds

207
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,360
interesting

208
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,480
in the first place.

209
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,360
But if you think about it,

210
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,840
there is a problem.

211
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,920
The debate topic

212
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
should not be made into films and dramas.

213
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,200
Why not?

214
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,000
Theoretically, any topic

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
can become literary and artistic works.

216
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,080
One just needs to dig into it.

217
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,560
What?

218
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,120
Then there's nothing to argue about.

219
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,520
It's not like that.

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,280
The other party will not

221
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,360
hold onto this point.

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
After all, debate

223
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,880
should bear a meaning.

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,840
We should find

225
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
specific examples.

226
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,280
What did the old coach say?

227
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,360
All debates

228
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,600
must have specific scenarios

229
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
as examples.

230
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,800
That's right.

231
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,240
For film and drama shooting,

232
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,240
what's the goal?

233
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,760
It's a commercial operation.

234
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,400
So the goal should be to make money.

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,040
It's against the rule to not make money.

236
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Debate topics are enjoyed by few

237
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,720
and may not have commercial value

238
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,440
or offer

239
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,600
great commercial profit.

240
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,160
So it's against the rule.

241
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
The idea is right.

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But the argument is too rudimentary.

243
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,080
Girls, aren't you sleepy?

244
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,400
I have a class at eight tomorrow morning.

245
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,960
Sorry.

246
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,600
Let's sleep.

247
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,880
I don't think it's a problem.

249
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,760
Most people wouldn't think so.

250
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
Who would film something

251
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,120
that nobody watches?

252
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,000
If no one is going to watch it,

253
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,920
then it's against the rule to make it.

254
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,440
It sounds correct at first.

255
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,600
But there's still something wrong about it.

256
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,720
Does the amount of audience

257
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,120
determine

258
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,320
the commercial value?

259
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,720
The potential

260
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
development and expansion

261
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,840
of the audience

262
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
requires testing.

263
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Then it involves

264
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,400
the cost of business decision-making.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,920
Making a TV drama

266
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
is so costly.

267
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,480
If one needs to try it out

268
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,160
to know

269
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,680
whether the decision

270
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,560
is correct,

271
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,720
then it's too risky

272
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
and too costly.

273
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,840
For decision-makers,

274
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,800
it's against the rules.

275
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,760
It makes sense.

276
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,440
Girls.

277
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,920
Sleep!

278
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,000
Alright.

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
Alright.

280
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
For real!

281
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,160
But high risk

282
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,400
is associated with high returns.

283
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,480
Besides,

284
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,480
films and dramas

285
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
are making money in various ways.

286
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,160
Will they stick to this argument

287
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,200
as a breakthrough?

288
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,000
You lost me again.

289
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,120
And me.

290
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,120
I'm not very bright.

291
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
Now, it's even worse.

292
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,920
I'm sure I can't sleep now.

293
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
I finally understand

294
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
why I'm losing so much hair.

295
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,280
Why don't we go run on the playground?

296
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,600
Let's go!

297
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,960
Go!

298
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Jeez, I'm getting more awake

299
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
thanks to the debate.

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,560
Help me.

301
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,360
Where are you going?

302
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
We talked about the debate

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,240
and got stuck.

304
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,400
It's the same here.

305
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,640
So where are you going?

306
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,600
Shui said that

307
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
he's got Killer's Game.

308
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,880
We're going for a break.

309
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,640
You going?

310
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,080
Sure. Let's go.

311
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,160
Go.

312
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,640
What's wrong with you?

313
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,560
What's wrong with you?

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
You have plenty of space

315
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,160
there.

316
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,240
Why do you have to squeeze here?

317
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,720
Why didn't you go there?

318
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,160
Why didn't you go there?

319
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,040
Why should I?

320
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Cut it out!

321
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,520
Let him go. Come.

322
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,080
Excuse us.

323
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,680
That girl's got

324
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
her guy under control.

325
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,440
Mind your own business.

326
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
It's so weird.

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Yeah.

328
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,240
Hello, everyone. I'm Dango.

329
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Mu Xiaoyu.

330
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,560
I am Nan Bei.

331
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,600
You can call me Ma Nan.

332
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,760
Hello, everyone. I'm Yuan.

333
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,440
Yun.

334
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm Jingwei.

335
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
Call me Wu Shan.

336
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,120
Are you having

337
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,040
raw Pu'er tea here?

338
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
It seems that

339
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,200
you know about tea.

340
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
Just a bit. Not much.

341
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,360
Here you are.

342
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,360
Good tea.

343
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,240
Hello, my name is Tao Hao.

344
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,520
Hello, I'm Xia.

345
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,880
You go first.

346
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,400
You go first.

347
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,480
What would you like to have?

348
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,240
What would you like to have?

349
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,000
-Barbecue. -Iced lemon tea.

350
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,480
I want something spicy.

351
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,840
Anything spicy will do.

352
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,880
OK, I'll be right back.

353
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay.

354
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,640
Alright.

355
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,840
Now, please

356
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,600
confirm your identity.

357
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,920
Done?

358
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,880
Okay.

359
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,880
The night falls. Close your eyes.

360
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,680
The killers, please open your eyes.

361
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Please confirm the identity of your companions.

362
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,640
Please choose the person you want to kill.

363
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,680
Please make a decision.

364
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,000
It'll be day time if you don't make a decision.

365
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,760
Okay.

366
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,920
Please close your eyes.

367
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,320
Police, please open your eyes.

368
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,720
Please confirm your companions.

369
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,760
Please choose one person to verify the identity.

370
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,680
Please make a decision.

371
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,760
Are you sure?

372
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,880
This means "good".

373
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,760
This mean "bad".

374
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,080
This person is...

375
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,560
Okay.

376
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,520
Close your eyes. It's day.

377
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,840
It's day.

378
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,240
Last night,

379
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,160
player no. 3 Xiaoyu died.

380
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,240
Last words.

381
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,600
Nan Bei,

382
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,480
you killed me in the first round

383
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
of the first game!

384
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,520
Thankfully,

385
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,240
I checked your identity.

386
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,320
You're a killer.

387
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,200
What the hell?

388
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,840
I am the killer?

389
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,280
Wait, wait.

390
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,320
Did you ask him to check me?

391
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,320
Did you check me first?

392
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,920
No conversing!

393
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,400
What's wrong again?

394
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,000
The gift?

395
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,880
I spent all my money this month.

396
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,680
Next month,

397
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,120
I'll give you two gifts.

398
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,880
Are they a couple?

399
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,200
You sense it, too.

400
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,400
Actually, they like each other.

401
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,720
They just need to

402
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,640
tell each other.

403
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,600
What's wrong?

404
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,760
We're holding a debate contest,

405
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,600
and one team is dropping out.

406
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,480
It's getting tough.

407
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,200
You hold debates?

408
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,600
What is it called?

409
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,720
It's a small game,

410
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,800
the Edge Cup.

411
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,280
I don't think you've heard of it.

412
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
The team that dropped out

413
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,360
was called team 235, right?

414
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Can you guys

415
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,280
stay in the game?

416
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,840
Let's talk

417
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,840
about it.

418
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,400
Maybe

419
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
you can find

420
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,640
other debaters?

421
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,680
We don't offer many points.

422
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,080
There aren't many players.

423
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,440
Now,

424
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,000
you're the only team left.

425
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,160
We

426
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,160
chose to drop out because

427
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,240
there's another game

428
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,400
at the same time.

429
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,240
They offer three points.

430
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,760
We're exactly three points short.

431
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,040
Otherwise, we wouldn't.

432
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,800
In fact, we've been

433
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,840
struggling to hold

434
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,080
the game for years.

435
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,760
It's not a top competition,

436
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,040
and we offer only two points.

437
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,560
Nothing has been easy

438
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,840
but we managed until today.

439
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,480
If it is cancelled this year,

440
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,600
Next year, I'm afraid...

441
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,000
I hope

442
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,360
you can attend

443
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,680
the Edge Cup.

444
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
I'm really sorry.

445
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,560
We

446
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,880
have no other options.

447
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,120
Oh.

448
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,840
It's okay.

449
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,600
You did well today.

450
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,640
I just thought...

451
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
It's like how we turned against team one

452
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
to win the game back then.

453
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,200
I sympathize with them, too.

454
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,160
But

455
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,280
every team has its own problems

456
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,760
to be solved by themselves.

457
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,240
Listen to that!

458
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,520
You've grown up.

459
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,600
Treat me to bubble tea.

460
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,440
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

461
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,800
I should be rewarded

462
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,200
for helping you recover.

463
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
But

464
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,720
considering your good performance,

465
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,880
I'll treat you.

466
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Coming.

467
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,480
Guys,

468
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,840
here's the takeout.

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,480
How did you find this place?

470
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,800
I asked around

471
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,440
and nobody knew.

472
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,160
Finally,

473
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,960
a delivery man

474
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,680
showed me the way.

475
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Hello, Killer.

476
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,800
You've got quite some

477
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,480
hobbies.

478
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,800
To train for the debate in such an environment

479
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,320
is very

480
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,280
luxurious for me.

481
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,920
Have some tea.

482
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,360
Thank you.

483
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,880
You're not here

484
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,200
just for a visit, are you?

485
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,080
Tao Hao,

486
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,720
I know your team

487
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
is having a hard time.

488
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,960
But I really need help.

489
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,720
Can you help me?

490
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,040
We

491
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,480
will think about it.

492
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,680
You will?

493
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,840
That's great.

494
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,640
Think about it.

495
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,520
Think about it.

496
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,400
Please think about it.

497
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,160
Enjoy your food.

498
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,840
We're just going to think about it.

499
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,360
I didn't promise him anything.

500
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

501
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,520
It's even worse.

502
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,400
You're giving him

503
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
false hope.

504
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,880
Is it really that bad?

505
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,360
We'll see.

506
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,040
Got it.

507
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,480
I'll get dinner and come over.

508
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,360
Xia?

509
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,360
Don't worry.

510
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,120
He won't come again.

511
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,640
Okay.

512
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,920
Tao Hao.

513
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm leaving.

514
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,800
I'm leaving.

515
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,880
I cleaned the car twice.

516
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,080
Rest assured.

517
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,720
Tao Hao,

518
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,960
may the sunflowers bring you sunshine.

519
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,400
Thank you.

520
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:17,880
Give me that.

521
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,960
Sunflower.

522
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
Hey, do you want some sunflower seeds?

523
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,480
It's yours.

524
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,920
Those who skipped the class

525
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,520
yesterday

526
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,720
had to copy short essays.

527
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I did it until midnight.

528
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm so sleepy.

529
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,360
Why

530
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,280
did you skip the lesson?

531
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
Madam,

532
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,040
please dive into

533
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,000
your memory.

534
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,960
Wasn't I sitting

535
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,640
next to you

536
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
yesterday?

537
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,960
I forgot.

538
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,440
What's wrong

539
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,480
between you and Liu Yanze?

540
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,160
He took your girlfriend?

541
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,560
I don't mind

542
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,000
telling you this.

543
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,200
You

544
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,440
are my first love.

545
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,360
Then what's the problem?

546
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Please, it hurts.

547
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,600
Just tell me.

548
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,000
When did you become so gossipy?

549
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm not gossiping.

550
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,160
It's for Dango.

551
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,000
What if he's a scum?

552
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,960
We should stop her.

553
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,400
Dango has

554
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,360
no taste.

555
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,520
What's so great about Liu Yanze?

556
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,680
Everything.

557
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,200
He's good at debating.

558
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
He's quite handsome.

559
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,520
He's president of the student union.

560
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,360
And he has good grades.

561
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,240
What?

562
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,720
Oh my,

563
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,480
you're angry.

564
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,360
What's wrong?

565
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,280
I'm afraid Xia

566
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,160
would come out of nowhere.

567
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,560
You're being dramatic.

568
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,960
He's not a ninja.

569
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,480
Me?

570
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,360
Come.

571
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,480
Come on, buddy.

572
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,920
Dude,

573
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,800
you go around here all day.

574
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,200
You've improved a lot

575
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,240
in pestering people

576
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
instead of debating.

577
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,040
Why don't you

578
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,880
split your team

579
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,400
in two to debate by yourselves?

580
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,280
You're wasting

581
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,880
your time and energy here.

582
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,680
Visit a nursing home.

583
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Even the earthworms

584
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
can entertain themselves.

585
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,280
You can learn from them.

586
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,480
Then you won't have to ask for help,

587
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,880
right?

588
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,680
Why would a debate organizer

589
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,720
hang around here all the time?

590
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:49,960
Hey, hey.

591
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,800
Don't do this, man.

592
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,280
Hey.

593
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,520
Don't cry.

594
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Let's go. I'll buy you a drink.

595
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,520
Stop crying.

596
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,200
Who is this?

597
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,400
See for yourself.

598
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,400
Man,

599
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,440
are you planning to...?

600
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,320
Don't be impulsive.

601
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,880
Listen,

602
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Hao has no interest

603
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,160
in him.

604
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,440
Write a novel, alright?

605
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,000
Then what's going on?

606
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,400
He has been pestering Hao.

607
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,480
I roasted him.

608
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,960
That's it.

609
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,120
How did you

610
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,480
get him so drunk?

611
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,120
What to do now?

612
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,680
He's wasted.

613
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,120
What to do?

614
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,560
Let's call his friends first.

615
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,440
Sure.

616
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,360
Hey,

617
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,200
this dude has a girlfriend.

618
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

619
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,760
Do you know where he lives?

620
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,560
In the debate classroom.

621
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,960
Huh?

622
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,480
He's drunk

623
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
because of debating, huh?

624
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,640
How do you know?

625
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,920
It happens every time.

626
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,760
I thought he was on the debate team.

627
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Why is he hosting games?

628
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,360
Fill it up.

629
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,600
He was the leader

630
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,160
of the debate team

631
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
back at the university.

632
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,600
Maybe the university wasn't great,

633
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,200
or maybe they weren't talented.

634
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,200
They were never invited to big games

635
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
and were often told to drop out.

636
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,080
It doesn't

637
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,720
have much to do with the university.

638
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,360
The good universities are the same.

639
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,400
Right, Ma Nan?

640
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,680
Yeah, it's about the debaters.

641
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
But he just wants to debate.

642
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,160
So he started the Edge Cup.

643
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,600
But of course,

644
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,120
they couldn't even attract

645
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
enough debaters.

646
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,520
In the first year,

647
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,000
some people

648
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
just like him were coming

649
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,960
to the game.

650
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,360
But since last year,

651
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,680
their games have been degrading

652
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,000
and losing participants.

653
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,200
So this year,

654
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,560
there is no financial support.

655
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,720
Will you do this for

656
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,200
your hobby?

657
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,520
That's not the right question.

658
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,000
For him,

659
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
it's not a hobby anymore.

660
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,760
But,

661
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,720
it was hard

662
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,080
for us to get so far.

663
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,360
Tao Hao,

664
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,480
let's go to the Edge Cup.

665
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,680
I've never done a tripartite debate.

666
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,080
It'd be interesting, right?

667
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,240
That's right.

668
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,560
I've long wanted

669
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,640
to battle team one.

670
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,600
Why is it feeling

671
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
so exciting?

672
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,360
So,

673
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
it's a deal.

674
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,680
Time is up.

675
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,400
Okay, thank you.

676
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,160
This is what debate means to me

677
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,360
and

678
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,360
to all the debaters

679
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
here on the spot.

680
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,880
No matter

681
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,720
how difficult it is,

682
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,160
we should just

683
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,480
do it.

684
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,360
Captain,

685
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,680
we're going to face team two.

686
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,240
Next, let's welcome Nanxiang Technical School,

687
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,400
DUFE,

688
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,720
and Team 235

689
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,400
to draw

690
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,280
the argument for the upcoming match.

691
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,760
Party A,

692
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,200
one must learn to take on burdens.

693
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,920
Party C,

694
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,360
one must learn to accept the fate.

695
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,960
What a loser's motion!

696
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,480
It suits you.

697
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,960
Accept the fate with the game.

698
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,920
Not everyone can take on burdens.

699
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,960
Let's see.

700
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,760
I...

701
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,000
Should I draw?

702
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,600
What a bad draw!

703
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,000
What's wrong with your luck?

704
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,960
Why can't you

705
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,920
be like team one

706
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,280
and draw a better motion?

707
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,120
Ouch.

708
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,880
Coach,

709
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,840
their argument

710
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,280
is that one should accept the fate.

711
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,400
It's not easy, right?

712
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,800
Jeez,

713
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,760
the orange is so sour.

714
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,960
No, it's not.

715
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,800
I'm peeling it for you

716
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,000
and feeding it to you.

717
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,080
What's your problem?

718
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,760
Your students are here.

719
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,280
I'll give you some respect.

720
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,160
Don't push it.

721
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,480
I have ulcer.

722
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,280
I don't want oranges.

723
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,520
Can you

724
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,320
get me a dragon fruit or something

725
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
from downstairs.

726
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,760
Maybe it helps.

727
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
I've been treating you too well.

728
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,960
You're so spoiled.

729
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,200
Kids,

730
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,880
I'll leave your coach to you.

731
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,640
Don't let him out of bed.

732
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,920
Don't worry, Madam.

733
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,600
Don't worry, Madam.

734
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,360
Alright.

735
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,000
She's watching me

736
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,800
like I'm a prisoner.

737
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,560
I'm done.

738
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm eating like a monk these days.

739
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,760
Now I don't

740
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,000
taste anything

741
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,880
and I'm bored to do anything.

742
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,480
Coach,

743
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,160
aren't you

744
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,720
eating light these days?

745
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,240
How did you get the ulcer?

746
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,800
Wait.

747
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,520
That's why the bag

748
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,720
is so hot.

749
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,480
Oh.

750
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,000
Chen's Sauce Pork.

751
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,560
What is this?

752
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,520
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

753
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,000
Give it here.

754
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,440
Maybe you should...

755
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,520
Give me that,

756
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,880
and I'll lecture you.

757
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,640
My brain is not working properly.

758
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Why didn't you bring it earlier?

759
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,640
Nice.

760
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,400
Not bad. Thank you.

761
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
Coach, let's make it fast.

762
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,640
There's a tripartite debate tomorrow.

763
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,360
Our opponent

764
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
is the annoying team one.

765
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,760
We've never done it.

766
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,920
Tell us about

767
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,160
the tactics and rules.

768
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,640
The key points

769
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,160
are summarized into a poem.

770
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,680
A poem?

771
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,880
Take advantage of your opponent's arguments.

772
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,800
Seek the origin of the argument.

773
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,400
Attack the opponents on the key points.

774
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,080
Use their contradiction to set them up.

775
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,800
Substitute one thing for another to buy some time.

776
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,640
Oh no.

777
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
My brain is not working.

778
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,600
Get me

779
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,760
some spiced peanuts.

780
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,760
Go ahead.

781
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,200
Oh my,

782
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,080
Madam,

783
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,720
the coach just...

784
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,360
Shut up!

785
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,000
Hurry up and learn.

786
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
Time is running out.

787
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,160
About the tripartite competition,

788
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,720
we have to make arrangements

789
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,480
and find their

790
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,840
potential loopholes.

791
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
Do you understand?

792
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,360
That's what the old coach said?

793
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,840
Well,

794
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I'm wondering if it's possible...

795
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,200
I mean maybe

796
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,800
team one wins and we rank second.

797
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,520
Will we share

798
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,600
the points in the end?

799
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,280
For the tripartite debate,

800
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,600
only the first place has points.

801
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,840
None for the others.

802
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,960
So...

803
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,960
So,

804
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,120
you should

805
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,800
shift your focus

806
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,640
from romance.

807
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,520
This is not a drill.

808
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,080
I repeat.

809
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,640
This is not a drill.

810
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
This is the final showdown

811
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,560
against team one.

812
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,400
Why are you yelling?

813
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
I said "maybe".

814
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,000
I, I just thought

815
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,600
there is the possibility.

816
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,680
If that happens,

817
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,040
we won't go to the provincial level.

818
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,280
All right.

819
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,960
We'll crush them!

820
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,000
Let's assign tasks.

821
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,160
I'll make the argument as usual.

822
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,680
Nan Bei and Xiaoyu, main debaters.

823
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Ma Nan, closing argument.

824
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Dango, information collector.

825
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,640
Any questions?

826
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,880
No.

827
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,440
Have you checked the rules?

828
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,200
It's a three-person competition.

829
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,520
Only three debaters are allowed.

830
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,880
What?

831
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,320
Then I'm not going.

832
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,400
That'd be a good idea.

833
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,360
Then I won't go either.

834
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,760
Ma Nan,

835
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,640
you can't

836
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,040
keep a low profile now.

837
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,720
You are a fine debater.

838
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,520
I agree.

839
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,200
That's it, then.

840
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,720
That's it for today.

841
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,080
Well,

842
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,640
do you have any plans this evening?

843
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,120
No, why?

844
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,000
Nothing.

845
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,160
See you then.

846
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,720
Bye.

847
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,880
Hao, bye.

848
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,000
Bye, Hao.

849
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,800
See you.

850
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,600
Stop.

851
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,400
What's wrong?

852
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,360
Dango.

853
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,520
Why do I feel

854
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,520
that I won't like

855
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,600
this conversation?

856
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,520
Ma Nan,

857
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,640
we always respect you

858
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,240
as our senior...

859
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,800
predecessor...

860
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,600
and a guide on debate.

861
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,080
Even though you're

862
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,360
passive, procrastinating, lazy,

863
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,720
bad at personal hygiene,

864
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,680
indecisive when something happens...

865
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,200
sometimes arrogant...

866
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,000
and occasionally

867
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,760
belittle others

868
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,600
to praise yourself,

869
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,600
we generally

870
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,320
think pretty highly

871
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,480
of you.

872
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,720
Hmm.

873
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,880
Thank you?

874
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,880
So we feel the need

875
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,920
to give you a push

876
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,800
in some things.

877
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,520
What is it?

878
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,200
When exactly are you going to

879
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,360
ask Hao out?

880
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,160
See you around.

881
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,720
Sit down.

882
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:53,920
Come on.

883
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,880
Don't mess things up.

884
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,480
Tao Hao and I are...

885
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:57,880
Shut up!

886
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,680
Come on!

887
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,960
Are we blind?

888
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,720
Don't move.

889
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,960
Thank you.

890
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,760
Well,

891
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,360
that's all for today.

892
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,320
Go back to rest.

893
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,520
Ma Nan.

894
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,920
Do you have any plans later?

895
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,560
No. You?

896
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,960
Me neither.

897
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,800
Oh.

898
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,680
See you, then.

899
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,960
Oh.

900
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,560
See you tomorrow.

901
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,240
Hey.

902
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,480
Well,

903
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,040
"Three Hundred Days of First Love" will be on.

904
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,920
Shall we watch it together?

905
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,560
Sure.

906
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,560
OK, then.

907
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,520
Nan Bei, Xiaoyu, and Dango,

908
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,200
are you going?

909
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
I have plans. I'm busy.

910
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,360
I'm busy. I have plans.

911
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,400
None of us has time.

912
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:55,880
All right then.

913
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,160
I'll ask Meng Yuan and Dandan.

914
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,800
Then let's go together.

915
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,600
Great. The more the merrier, right?

916
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,680
See?

917
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,800
You're so sweet together.

918
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,840
You've made it

919
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,880
to the ninth sweetest

920
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,200
couple-to-be.

921
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,480
It's still getting updated?

922
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,680
Stop trying. You have no argument.

923
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,000
Even if you're right

924
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,600
that there's chemistry between us,

925
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,400
we can't rush

926
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
with those things, OK?

927
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,720
I have my own tempo.

928
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,600
Show some respect!

929
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
I had concerns before.

930
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,080
Do you want me to witness

931
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,400
Meng Yuan's tragedy again?

932
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,120
No!

933
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,200
You can't let it happen!

934
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,520
You know better than that!

935
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,120
So there's

936
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,880
one possibility left.

937
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,240
You

938
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,000
chickened out!

939
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,680
You couldn't make the final move.

940
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,240
You can't even win a sure game.

941
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,880
You're a tank

942
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,160
hiding behind a mage.

943
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,600
You're a disgrace!

944
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,880
Stop, stop.

945
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,640
You guys

946
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,000
have made your points

947
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,440
quite clear.

948
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,240
You got me, okay?

949
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,680
I swear

950
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,440
I'll make the move

951
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,680
at the right moment.

952
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,480
Okay?

953
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,320
Come on.

954
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,360
What's that look?

955
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Do you want me to go now?

956
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,520
That's right!

957
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,800
If not now, when?

958
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
After graduation?

959
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,120
After retirement?

960
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,840
We've

961
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,240
prepared two movie tickets

962
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:19,880
for you.

963
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,200
"Godzilla vs. Kong"?

964
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,960
Sorry, those are mine.

965
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,240
These are yours.

966
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,160
"We'll Get Better"?

967
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,480
Yeah.

968
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,760
You will

969
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,080
get better together.

970
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,080
How nice.
