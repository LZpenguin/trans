Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP25

2
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,160
Excuse me.

3
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
We have got the marriage certificate.

4
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
Why should we break up?

5
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,960
Your parents came here.

6
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,240
I have arranged everything, right?

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
Is that called arrangement?

8
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,760
I took my parents

9
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,600
all the way

10
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
to visit your parents.

11
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,600
What tickets did you buy

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,280
for my parents

13
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,440
and what seats did you book?

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,520
You said that your parents are not in good health

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,160
so I didn't

16
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
book air tickets for them.

17
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,000
I booked them

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,080
the high-speed rail business seats.

19
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
This high-speed rail business seat

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,960
is more expensive than an air ticket.

21
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,760
It's not bad, right?

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,480
Yeah.

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,320
Your house is decorated like a palace

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
but when my parents came

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,760
you booked them a hotel.

26
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,640
I booked

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
a five-star hotel.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
A five-star hotel?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,280
I have not even

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
stayed in a five-star hotel.

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,160
Am I right?

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,680
Yeah.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,400
I married all the way here

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
and we already got the marriage certificate.

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,600
You didn't allow my parents to enter your house?

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Don't you know

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,320
how many rooms are there in the house?

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
You can't let me sleep on the floor, right?

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,000
Besides

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,040
if business seats on high-speed trains replacing air tickets

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,320
is still considered bullying you

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,120
then you bully me!

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
Divorce.

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,480
When we were in love

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,040
you were always perfunctory to me.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
You were late every time

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,560
and told me that you were late for work

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,000
or you played football the day before

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
or you would go to a party the day after tomorrow.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,840
You gave me a variety of reasons.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm telling you, young lady.

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,280
You should be careful.

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,920
If he can be late today to perfuse you

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,240
he will be able to cheat tomorrow.

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Don't worry, sister.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,880
My boyfriend is timid.

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,280
He dare not.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,640
Why are you aggrieved?

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,560
Why are you aggrieved?

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,960
Why don't you talk about yourself?

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,040
Each time you were unhappy

62
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
you would break up with me.

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Bossed me around

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,320
in front of others.

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm a man.

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,360
Don't I want face?

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,320
Don't I want my face?

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
I don't need my face.

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,160
I don't need my face.

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
No, no, no. You need face.

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,040
But others' boyfriends

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
are all like this.

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,640
You always say that I'm not sensible.

74
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,080
If I'm not sensible

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,200
I would have bought

76
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
all the bags in the mall.

77
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,840
Well.

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,480
Let's sort out

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,440
what it means.

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
You two already

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,800
got your marriage license

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,480
but you two want to

83
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,640
break up.

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
According to what you said

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,960
and what you wrote

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,760
on this application form

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,920
Miss Chen felt that Mr. Gu

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,040
offered little bride price

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,000
and disrespected her and her family.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Mr. Gu

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,520
thought Miss Chen

92
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,680
was not reasonable

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,480
and her personality

94
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,240
is incompatible with yours.

95
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,040
Incompatible.

96
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
Incompatible with everything.

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Even our horoscopes are incompatible.

98
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,240
Incompatible, right?

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
When you chased me

100
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,360
you said we were meant to be together.

101
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
Now you turn your back on me.

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
Okay, the house is mine.

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
How can you have the nerve to ask for the house?

104
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
Did you marry me

105
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
or marry my money?

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,000
Fine.

107
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,400
Return the 300 thousand yuan bride price to me.

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,560
Give it back.

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Only 300 thousand yuan.

110
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
You still have the nerve to say.

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,480
Why can't I say?

112
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,880
Did the wind blow that money to me?

113
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,560
How can you mention that?

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,760
I married all the way here.

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,800
Hey.

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,760
She hits me.

117
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,320
No, no, no.

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,080
Hit me.

119
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,840
Don't.

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,720
Nan Bei, they made my ears ring.

121
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,760
Here, let me blow you some air.

122
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,440
Stop that now.

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,360
I originally thought that

124
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,640
if I found such a person

125
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
to like each other

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,960
it would be enough to be together.

127
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
I didn't expect it to be just the beginning.

128
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
In fact, there are

129
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,760
so many things to come.

130
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,480
We are in the passionate love period

131
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
so don't think about

132
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,080
unhappy things.

133
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
Have you ever thought about

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,480
the future of the two of us?

135
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,840
Of course I have.

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
Let's eat hot pot later.

137
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm not talking about this.

138
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,440
What is that then?

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
Nan Bei, are you playing dumb with me?

140
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,360
If you are like this

141
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
we will break up sooner or later.

142
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,280
I'm not.

143
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,040
Don't think too much.

144
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,000
The future will always come.

145
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,880
Let's cherish the moment.

146
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,480
The main reason is that

147
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
too much thinking can't solve the problem.

148
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,080
Right?

149
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,800
Your attitude is so negative.

150
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm not negative.

151
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm very optimistic.

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,880
Break up.

153
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,800
Do you think girls

154
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,520
love to

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
talk about breakups?

156
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,480
I was just joking.

157
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
I didn't want to break up.

158
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,400
I said break up

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,000
just to

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,080
make him pay attention to me.

161
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,160
I knew it was a joke at first

162
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,040
but she can't keep saying it.

163
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I know

164
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,520
it's not right to

165
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,760
keep saying those two words.

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,000
Now she said it

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
more and more often.

168
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,320
But I just want him to change.

169
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
You know that

170
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,520
we have known each other

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,000
for so long.

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,040
How can we break up so easily?

173
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,320
Even if I knew

174
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
it was a joke at first

175
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,400
she couldn't say it every day.

176
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
It was a slip of tongue again tonight.

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,160
She said it everyday, what should I do?

178
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,400
I said break up again.

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,680
He doesn't even coax me now.

180
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,840
But I also need someone to coax me.

181
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,200
What should I do?

182
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,640
What should I do?

183
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Let me ask you.

184
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,760
If Xiaoyu chased you

185
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,120
in the same way

186
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,240
as Dango chasing Liu Yanze back then

187
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,960
would you be happy?

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,200
Then I'll transfer to another school.

189
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,960
Isn't it the same?

190
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,960
If Xiaoyu were not like this

191
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
would you like her?

192
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,440
Think about it the other way around.

193
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,840
Are you more handsome than Dandan?

194
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,480
Are you better at debating

195
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,520
than Liu Yanze?

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Are you more mature than me

197
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,320
in handling problems?

198
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
Are you more masculine than Xiaoyu?

199
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,600
Why didn't she let you change?

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,960
What does this mean?

201
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,080
She didn't let you change.

202
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,840
What do you think it means?

203
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,920
I'm her true love.

204
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
It's only part of it.

205
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,040
Another part shows that

206
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,480
she's blind.

207
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,520
Does Hao have faults?

208
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,520
No.

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,400
But if I have to say, she also has faults.

210
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,280
She's too much of a planner.

211
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,880
She works too efficiently

212
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,680
and walks without looking at the road.

213
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
She thinks more but eats less

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,520
and likes to meddle in things

215
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
especially my business.

216
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,080
It is

217
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,480
the intermittent perfectionism

218
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,720
caused by years of OCD.

219
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,280
And she always let me drink milk.

220
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,640
I really can't drink milk.

221
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,960
I am lactose intolerant.

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,360
Then you really love her.

223
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,360
You can't say that.

224
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,160
Hey.

225
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
What do you think

226
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,360
she thinks of me?

227
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,000
Think in his position?

228
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,800
Yeah.

229
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Imagine

230
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,680
if Nan Bei always

231
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,480
mentioned breakup in front of you

232
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,440
what would you do?

233
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
Kill him.

234
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,040
In fact, now

235
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
boys are much more

236
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,440
vulnerable than girls.

237
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
If he scolded you, you would get angry.

238
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,200
If you scolded him

239
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,520
he might

240
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
hide and cry somewhere.

241
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,240
The more the boy likes to

242
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,080
show off in front of the girl he loves

243
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,160
the more

244
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,480
inferior he is inside.

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Really?

246
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,520
Hao

247
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,600
Do you and Ma Nan

248
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,360
have plans for after graduation?

249
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,400
He didn't really think about it.

250
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,120
I... I have quite a lot of plans.

251
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
He doesn't plan, and you're not angry about it?

252
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,160
No.

253
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,000
Anyway, I'm used to

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
like planning.

255
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,320
Our personalities complement each other.

256
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,200
Ma Nan

257
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,800
If I just recorded

258
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,760
what you said

259
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
and sold it to Hao

260
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
how much money would she give me?

261
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,560
Get away.

262
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm going to your dormitory

263
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,720
to call you.

264
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
You are so active?

265
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,920
Just to let

266
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
my queen

267
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,480
see me

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,440
at the first ray of sunlight.

269
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,440
Let's go.

270
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,080
The secretary wants us to

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,840
go to their home

272
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,880
to understand the situation again.

273
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,480
Breakfast.

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,120
Let's go.

275
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
I have decided

276
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,000
to help you plan in the future.

277
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,160
Finish the paper first.

278
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,920
Then make up all your credits.

279
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,600
After breakfast in the morning

280
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,560
running and memorizing new words.

281
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,880
Go to the library in the afternoon

282
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
and in the evening.

283
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,600
-Evening.  -Wait.

284
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Are you Mr. Li Possessed?

285
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,880
Ma Nan. I can ignore small things

286
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,640
but your graduation

287
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,880
can't be delayed any longer.

288
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
Otherwise, when I graduate

289
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
you would have not graduated yet.

290
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,120
My stomach hurts.

291
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
Stomach medicine, cold medicine

292
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,880
Huoxiang Zhengqi liquid

293
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
I have all prepared for you.

294
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
I will be with you.

295
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,480
You're late today.

296
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,680
We quarreled again yesterday

297
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,960
and are ready to get divorced.

298
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,960
Why don't you guys calm down for a while?

299
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,440
How difficult it is for you two

300
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
to be together and get married.

301
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,080
That's true

302
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,280
but not everyone

303
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,160
is reasonable to you.

304
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,400
Yesterday

305
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,000
our company held a financing meeting.

306
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,640
What an important meeting it was.

307
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,720
Just because I didn't

308
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,600
answer her call

309
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,360
she made the call from the front desk

310
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,560
to my assistant.

311
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,920
She also insisted that

312
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,520
they filmed me a video

313
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,800
to prove that I was in a meeting.

314
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Do you think this is too much?

315
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,040
How did I know

316
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
what he was doing, right?

317
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
Eleven o'clock in the middle of the night

318
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,240
how did I know he was in a meeting

319
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,040
or in a hotel?

320
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,840
Besides

321
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
if he knew he'd be late

322
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,600
why didn't give me a call

323
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,040
in advance?

324
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,320
Right?

325
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,880
This showed that

326
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,640
he has no sense of family.

327
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,400
He didn't include me

328
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,440
in his life.

329
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,920
It was not over yet.

330
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,720
At twelve o'clock in the middle of the night

331
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,840
she unexpectedly

332
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,920
came to the company by herself.

333
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
She scolded me

334
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,240
in front of

335
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,960
so many colleagues.

336
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,400
This was so embarrassing.

337
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
When we got home

338
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
she had to check my phone.

339
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
What's wrong with checking his phone?

340
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
He can also

341
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,160
check mine.

342
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,440
It was okay for her

343
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,400
to check

344
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,440
my WeChat record.

345
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,040
But that was not enough.

346
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,040
She insisted that I post a WeChat moment

347
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,120
to say I love her.

348
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,000
If I didn't post on Moments

349
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,800
I just didn't love her.

350
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,240
I told her this is

351
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,680
a WeChat account for work

352
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,160
and suggested to post it on another account.

353
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,960
She didn't agree.

354
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,040
She said I'm a playboy

355
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,360
and keep many backups in my phone.

356
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,400
What does this mean?

357
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,800
Playboy.

358
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,760
It doesn't matter if he didn't want to post it.

359
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,600
I don't care.

360
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,160
Let's talk about

361
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,240
the bride price.

362
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,280
The decoration of this house

363
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,000
should cost a million, right?

364
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,760
He only gave 300 thousand yuan

365
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,960
to my parents.

366
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,200
The decoration of this house

367
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,280
costed more than one million yuan,

368
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
all of which was contributed by my family.

369
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,920
Of course, I don't care about this.

370
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,520
But she can't

371
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,280
go too far.

372
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
How can we live in the future?

373
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,120
My parents have

374
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,280
only one daughter

375
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,040
and I married from afar.

376
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,360
How distressed my parents are!

377
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,240
Now

378
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,280
when I think of these

379
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,440
my kidney hurts.

380
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,840
Can you understand?

381
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,880
Then

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
she talked about

383
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
the bride price.

384
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,640
Wait a minute.

385
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,160
I

386
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,000
came straight

387
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,760
from work

388
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,680
and haven't had any water.

389
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,560
Wait a minute.

390
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,280
I have some good tea.

391
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,600
Okay.

392
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,080
Here.

393
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,040
Thank you.

394
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,640
It's good.

395
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,360
Right? Drink more.

396
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,600
Your wedding photo

397
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,360
looks good.

398
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,360
Ugh.

399
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,920
This wedding photo

400
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,640
was taken last year.

401
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,560
At that time, one of her colleagues

402
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,840
showed her own wedding photos to her.

403
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,840
After she saw them, she was so excited

404
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,440
and insisted on taking them at the same place.

405
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,880
In the end

406
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,320
she chose a set

407
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,520
that was more expensive

408
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,760
than her colleague's in the store.

409
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,920
At that time, I thought that

410
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,640
it was enough

411
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,400
to take a cost-effective

412
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,560
wedding photo.

413
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,240
She didn't.

414
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
she had to do this fancy stuff.

415
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,880
Then you still agreed to her

416
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,640
didn't you?

417
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,080
I also want to

418
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,880
satisfy her as much as possible.

419
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,560
Hum.

420
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,760
Even at that moment...

421
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,680
Never mind.

422
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,520
Let's not talk about it.

423
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,840
Don't.

424
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,760
They're inside

425
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,360
and can't hear you.

426
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,920
We are both men.

427
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,680
I'm still unsophisticated in this kind of things.

428
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,880
I want to have a lesson.

429
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,160
Tell me something.

430
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,480
At that moment

431
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,000
I just paid

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
the decoration deposit for this house.

433
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
Originally, there was still a surplus of money.

434
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,920
I didn't expect that something went wrong

435
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,000
with the company at that time.

436
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,320
The compensation alone

437
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,520
was too much for me.

438
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,640
I really didn't have any money

439
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,160
in my pocket at that time.

440
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,080
Several credit cards were maxed out.

441
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
But I still had to take the wedding photo, right?

442
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,080
Twenty thousand yuan.

443
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,040
I couldn't even pay for the gas

444
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,200
for the car.

445
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,080
Where could I find

446
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,000
this twenty thousand yuan?

447
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,840
Then why didn't you tell her?

448
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,240
I couldn't tell her.

449
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,160
I'm a man.

450
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,120
I have to take the responsibility.

451
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,760
Yeah.

452
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,920
Maybe I am still too young.

453
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,880
I can't understand.

454
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,920
And then?

455
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,600
Later

456
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,680
I had to borrow money everywhere.

457
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,000
I always wanted to

458
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,320
give her what she wanted.

459
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,960
After that

460
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,360
the company slowly turned around.

461
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,400
I paid back the money I borrowed

462
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,560
and the final payment for the decoration of the house

463
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,640
was also settled.

464
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,120
Finally I scraped together

465
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
the cost of

466
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,880
the wedding and the bride price.

467
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,560
That's how I have come this far.

468
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,800
But I didn't expect that

469
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,680
she is now increasingly

470
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,000
unable to understand me.

471
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,120
How should I try to understand you?

472
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,120
You didn't say anything to me.

473
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,200
How could I understand you?

474
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,120
Why should I tell you this?

475
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm a man.

476
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,200
You didn't say anything.

477
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,480
You shouldn't do that.

478
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
You were with me

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
when I had nothing.

480
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,840
Now that I am able to take care of you.

481
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,640
I don't want you to be aggravated.

482
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,080
Quite smart.

483
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,360
Of course. Two years of partnership.

484
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,480
Hey.

485
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,760
How did you know

486
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,640
their conflicts

487
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,560
could be resolved so easily?

488
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,640
I didn't.

489
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,120
I just think that

490
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,560
it's better for the doer to undo what he has done.

491
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,240
Sometimes persuasion is useless.

492
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,280
If the two of them really want to get divorced

493
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,280
they don't need to trouble us.

494
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,720
Asking us for help

495
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,160
means they still have each other in their hearts.

496
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,920
How do you look so...

497
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,640
Handsome, right?

498
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
Let's go back to report the work.

499
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
We don't have to come tomorrow.

500
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,280
Hey.

501
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,880
There is not even a hug?

502
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,240
Your mission is done

503
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,040
very well this time.

504
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
They have

505
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,280
solved the problem.

506
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,160
Do you have a sense of accomplishment?

507
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,120
Of course.

508
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,240
Thanks to your support

509
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,320
for our work.

510
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
This job

511
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,320
is dull

512
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,360
compared to your school life,

513
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,000
right?

514
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,760
It's not dull at all.

515
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Okay. Then you can

516
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
get off work.

517
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,160
If you still want to come here after graduation

518
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,840
you will always be welcomed.

519
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,960
Okay. Thank you, secretary.

520
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,240
Where are we going?

521
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,080
Pack up and go back to school.

522
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,280
Get ready for training.

523
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,880
Let's stand our last shift.

524
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,960
Sit down, please.

525
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,120
Aren't you two going to say something?

526
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,240
There's nothing to say.

527
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,880
I will not waste our time.

528
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
And Mr.?

529
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,040
I also have nothing to say.

530
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,360
Let's move on to the next step.

531
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,760
My conclusion is correct.

532
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,480
If the fight is too fierce

533
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,280
they don't really want to divorce.

534
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,160
If they don't care about each other anymore

535
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,320
they want to end this relationship

536
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,800
peacefully.

537
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,320
I told you to break up before

538
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,640
but I didn't really want to

539
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,320
separate from you.

540
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,360
I...

541
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,400
I won't talk about that

542
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,320
in the future.

543
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,560
If I accidentally

544
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,560
talk about that again in the future

545
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,120
you beat me.

546
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,480
No, no, no.

547
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
I know you were joking.

548
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I didn't take it seriously.

549
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,600
I

550
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,920
just think there are a lot of problems

551
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
when two people

552
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,960
are in a relationship.

553
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
I have no confidence in my heart.

554
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,640
Hmmm

555
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,920
I lose my temper when I am anxious.

556
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,400
I understand.

557
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,080
We don't know

558
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,600
what will happen

559
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,440
in the future.

560
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,240
No matter how many unknowns

561
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
there will be in the future

562
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,560
we can face it together

563
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,920
at that time.

564
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,440
I will never say

565
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,520
you are feminine anymore.

566
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,960
You are quite a man.

567
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,040
They've been holding us up for a long time.

568
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,960
Let's get back for training.

569
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,800
Don't be late.

570
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,080
Let me take a look.

571
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,280
I...

572
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
I forgot we are going to

573
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,360
invite them to have hot pot.

574
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,680
We're late.

575
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,360
Hurry up.

576
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,080
Come on

577
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,000
guys.

578
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,440
Enjoy.

579
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,520
Enjoy.

580
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:43,800
I...

581
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,800
How much money do you have in Alipay?

582
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
Seventy.

583
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
How much more do we need?

584
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,960
One hundred and seventy-nine.

585
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,840
Come on.

586
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,600
Cheers.

587
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,480
Come on.

588
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,920
Okay.

589
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
Do you have money in your card?

590
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,640
Not a single penny.

591
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,520
Cheers.

592
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,360
Let's go.

593
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,680
Go.

594
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,520
They pay for it themselves.

595
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,600
Waiter

596
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,560
one more plate of snow beef.

597
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,280
Two.

598
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,320
Three.

599
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,480
I don't remember

600
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,800
any funny content in this book.

601
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,080
I have read this sentence

602
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,360
no less than five or six times.

603
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,800
I finally understood the meaning.

604
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,800
So I'm happy.

605
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,120
By the way

606
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,360
didn't you say

607
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,160
you were going to train later?

608
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
Yeah, I'm running late.

609
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,520
How about going to our place?

610
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,480
I mean

611
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,120
come to our training room.

612
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,800
No need.

613
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,120
I invite you.

614
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,360
Our team invites your team.

615
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
It's not necessary.

616
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,920
Our place

617
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,960
is really romantic.

618
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,640
You can also look at the stars

619
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,920
and the moon.

620
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,320
It's quite good.

621
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,480
Then why don't you

622
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,280
take me with you?

623
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,560
Nan Bei will eat you. I'm leaving.

624
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,400
Wow.

625
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,160
So serious.

626
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,040
Studying the lottery?

627
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,520
Sa

628
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
I have to say

629
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,080
as a coach and teacher

630
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,760
can you follow

631
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,520
our pace

632
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,520
and make progress together?

633
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,120
The provincial competition will be held in three days.

634
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,880
Sa

635
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,040
If you say so

636
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm a little unhappy inside.

637
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,840
It's like

638
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,760
we've never worked hard.

639
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,720
Yeah.

640
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,920
We have never been lazy.

641
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,560
Right.

642
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,200
Usually, it was me

643
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,800
who spent the whole night in the Internet cafe and didn't come to train,

644
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
and I took up the training time

645
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,560
to order takeaways.

646
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,600
It was me.

647
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,240
Only me.

648
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,920
Sa

649
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,200
has the provincial competition system

650
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
and roster been announced?

651
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:23,920
Yeah.

652
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,160
I came to

653
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,920
talk about this.

654
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,360
A total of 32 teams

655
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
participated in this provincial competition.

656
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
There will be two groups named A and B.

657
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,920
Sixteen teams in each group

658
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
will compete to win the group championship.

659
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,520
Finally, the group champions

660
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
will compete for the final championship.

661
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,520
We're in group A.

662
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
The good news is that

663
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,160
team one is in Group B.

664
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,320
Alas.

665
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,640
What a pity.

666
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,000
I wanted to take

667
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,960
this opportunity to take revenge

668
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,640
and teach them a lesson.

669
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,040
Right, Xiaoyu?

670
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,160
I don't think so.

671
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,040
I think it's nice

672
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,880
not to meet them for the time being.

673
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,040
The strongest team in Group A is...

674
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,760
Nanjiang Drama Academy.

675
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,000
Here.

676
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Take a look.

677
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,480
You are mediocre.

678
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,400
Your life is mediocre.

679
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,600
If we admit

680
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,880
that life without dream

681
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,040
is not mediocre

682
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,320
then is it

683
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,720
a comfort to those

684
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,640
who do not have dreams?

685
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,600
Don't know why

686
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,680
we should study hard

687
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,040
when we go to school.

688
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,920
She's good.

689
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,400
Scared the hell out of me.

690
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,720
You were a ninja in your last life, right?

691
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,760
Scared me to death.

692
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,040
Mission accomplished.

693
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,360
Yesterday

694
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,800
I met a fortune teller

695
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,360
he said I was a sentry

696
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,640
in my previous life.

697
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,320
Fine.

698
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,600
You won't see me

699
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,560
these days.

700
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,040
Our school travel club

701
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
is going to Shennongjia.

702
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,160
They need a guide.

703
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm going to be their tour guide.

704
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,000
I know what you are going to say.

705
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,240
Don't miss me.

706
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,080
Let me see.

707
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,400
Gu Bazi, Chen Buhe

708
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,560
Bazi Buhe (Horoscopes are incompatible).

709
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
The name is quite auspicious.

710
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,640
Don't use the allusion of name

711
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,120
to join in the fun.

712
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,760
Mr. Ma

713
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,440
What's your plan then?

714
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,560
I'll buy a dress in the afternoon.

715
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,640
Okay.

716
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,080
Then I'll ask

717
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,800
my Yanze to go with me.

718
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
Then let's...

719
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,440
Then let's go together.

720
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,760
It's been a long time since we went shopping.

721
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,920
Shopping...

722
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,520
Exquisite and elegant.

723
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,120
How about me?

724
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,560
Pure and cute.

725
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,120
Her face is seen in flowers and her dress in cloud.

726
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,560
A beauty by the rails caressed by vernal breeze.

727
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,520
Why do I feel that there is still something missing?

728
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,720
Hey.

729
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,000
Alas.

730
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,160
Alas.

731
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,840
The twenty-sixth set.

732
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,560
I really can't think of any words

733
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,680
to continue to praise them.

734
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,600
Why is it more difficult

735
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
than a debate competition?

736
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,160
Alas.

737
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,560
Prince

738
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,000
We came to have a meal together

739
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,840
just don't pretend to be

740
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,080
a high level intellectual, okay?

741
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,600
Just experience

742
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,720
the public entertainment once in a while.

743
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,480
I also played the game

744
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
you are playing

745
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,240
but I didn't play well

746
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,720
so I got kicked out.

747
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,560
There are still things you can't do well?

748
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,240
The alarm set by Tao Hao.

749
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,640
Time to write my paper.

750
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,560
It doesn't matter. Hao is shopping.

751
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,320
When a woman is shopping

752
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,840
Godzilla can't hold her.

753
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,960
Not to mention your paper.

754
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,600
Do you know Tao Hao's plan

755
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,480
to divide the twenty-four hours

756
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,280
into forty-eight

757
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,440
blocks of time?

758
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,680
Then she wouldn't

759
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,440
apply this to you,

760
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,200
who has only one time block

761
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,960
in twenty-four hours

762
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,840
right?

763
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,800
You don't know Tao Hao.

764
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,040
You just called me?

765
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Yes. We are talking about you.

766
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,000
I said I'm going back to write my paper.

767
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,280
They said that if I didn't go shopping with you

768
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,120
or eat with you

769
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,080
you would be angry.

770
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,040
I said how could you

771
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,760
influence my paper

772
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,160
because of these things, right?

773
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,280
Yes.

774
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,720
Hao

775
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
You obviously don't know much about Ma Nan.

776
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,160
When he goes back to bathe with burned incense

777
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,960
and power on the computer

778
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,640
it should be tomorrow.

779
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,520
Why don't

780
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I send him back

781
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,160
and help you supervise him in the meantime.

782
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,360
I'll send them both back.

783
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,120
They have no sense of direction.

784
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,280
They might get lost.

785
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,560
Don't bother.

786
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,400
I got this.

787
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,680
Ah?

788
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,680
Then I'll go shopping with them.

789
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,640
Come on.

790
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,160
Tell me.

791
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,760
How do you feel

792
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,640
about having

793
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
such a sweet girlfriend?

794
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Worse than death.

795
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,440
Isn't this analogy

796
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,840
a bit inappropriate?

797
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Every day with her

798
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,200
is like a new life.

799
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,440
Good!

800
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,200
Hao

801
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,160
Do I have to cover my neck

802
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,360
with a necklace?

803
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,240
It's a bit thick.

804
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,440
My mother just gave me one

805
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,400
some time ago.

806
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,520
I will show it to you later.

807
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,360
Okay.

808
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,040
Well, Xiaoyu

809
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,000
You are already beautiful enough.

810
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,800
If you were more beautiful

811
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,920
you would steal

812
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,280
the bride's limelight tomorrow.

813
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,640
I'm covering up my shame, sis.

814
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,760
I do not care.

815
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,560
Anyway,

816
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
if I get married

817
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,120
with my Yanze

818
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,000
you two should

819
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
be my bridesmaids.

820
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,200
Then if I

821
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,720
get married with Nan Bei

822
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,960
you two as my confidants

823
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,080
should also be my bridesmaids.

824
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,000
I want both of you...

825
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,440
I want all the girls in the dormitory

826
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,560
to be my bridesmaids.

827
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,640
I have to say

828
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,360
It's only my own idea.

829
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,240
I have no intention to diss you guys.

830
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,400
If you reach such an

831
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,080
agreement

832
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,760
then the last person to get married

833
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,520
will not have a bridesmaid.

834
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,040
But it doesn't matter.

835
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,880
Whenever you

836
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,920
get married

837
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,880
I will definitely be your bridesmaid.

838
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,360
Fanfan, you don't want to get married?

839
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,120
No.

840
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,880
I won't.

841
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,560
Don't.

842
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm very happy.

843
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,040
I have no character defects

844
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,000
or psychological shadows.

845
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,280
I think

846
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,280
the so-called marriage

847
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,360
means that you love someone very much

848
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,360
but

849
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,640
sometimes you want to shoot him.

850
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,240
On the way to buy a gun

851
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,320
you see his favorite food

852
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,520
so you buy the food instead of a gun.

853
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,080
Two days after

854
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,720
you still think

855
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,120
you should buy a gun.

856
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,560
This kind of repetitive thing

857
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,800
I find it very annoying.

858
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,120
It's suitable for you guys, not for me.

859
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,840
Fanfan

860
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,480
If you have no one

861
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
to support you in your old age

862
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,680
I will take you to my house

863
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
and we will spend time together.

864
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,640
I think it's good.

865
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,920
Xiaoyu

866
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,560
Are you going with Nan Bei tomorrow

867
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,400
to pick up the bride?

868
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,920
No.

869
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,680
I have to go to the hotel first

870
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,320
because I have a more important thing to do.

871
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,040
Chief planner of the wedding.

872
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,840
What?

873
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,080
Isn't that

874
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,720
how a gauzy dress turns?

875
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,360
Well.

876
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,000
Xiaoyu, let me tell you

877
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,320
if you and Nan Bei work together

878
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,880
there will be nothing wrong tomorrow.

879
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,960
Definitely not.

880
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,120
I guess this wedding

881
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,920
can not be done.

882
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,960
Hey.

883
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,680
You are an adult.

884
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,480
Don't be so impulsive, Okay?

885
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,440
It's just a marriage phobia.

886
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,480
Not a big deal. It's normal.

887
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,760
Right, Nan?

888
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,000
Let Nan tell you

889
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,160
about his mental journey.

890
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,480
I think

891
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,800
getting married

892
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,920
is a process of surrendering your freedom.

893
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,880
You will be fine if you work it out.

894
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,920
Bro

895
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,600
your thinking is very problematic.

896
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,080
Does Hao know?

897
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
You don't want to tattle on Xiaoyu

898
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,120
and take credit for it, right?

899
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,760
No.

900
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,400
Next time when Xiaoyu

901
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,000
points a finger

902
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,880
at me again

903
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,840
I have to break the news

904
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,960
and divert her attention.

905
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,640
Right?

906
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,680
But you really think so?

907
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,240
I actually don't resent

908
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,000
Tao Hao for controlling me.

909
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,280
On the contrary

910
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,000
because of her

911
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,600
my life is much more normal

912
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,760
than before.

913
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,840
But you know

914
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,600
I'm used to being alone

915
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,480
for so many years

916
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,760
so I still have to adapt to it.

917
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,480
Adapt for a few more decades.

918
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,640
Yeah, adapt to it.

919
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,720
Adapt to it. You are the same.

920
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,160
Enough for both of you.

921
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
Are you telling me cross talk here?

922
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,440
What you said is trivial.

923
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,560
I am troubled now

924
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,960
because of my mother-in-law.

925
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,520
She said that I should give a red envelope

926
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,240
to every relative at the wedding.

927
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,920
Is the amount of the red envelope large?

928
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,920
Are you... are you short of people? I'll sign up.

929
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,200
Fine, don't mess up.

930
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,040
It's quite large.

931
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,360
My mother-in-law said that

932
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,440
their family's

933
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,080
particularly distant relatives

934
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,840
will come tomorrow.

935
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,000
They take the effort

936
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,560
so I have to pay.

937
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Wait, wait, wait.

938
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,520
You booked the banquet

939
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,800
and decorated the house.

940
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,560
They just attend the banquet.

941
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,160
They just come here.

942
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,920
Hey.

943
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,000
What are you going to do?

944
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,080
I can not tell my parents

945
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,720
about this matter.

946
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
I really can't

947
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,680
pay a penny anymore.

948
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,280
Forget it if I can't get married.

949
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,920
To be honest.

950
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
I think the situation tomorrow

951
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,720
is dangerous

952
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,000
but it's not a big deal.

953
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,680
You don't want to stop getting married

954
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,920
because of this money, do you?

955
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,040
Yeah.

956
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,080
Wait, I will bring your wife

957
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,600
to you

958
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,640
on that day.

959
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,480
Okay?

960
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,120
Okay. Cheers.

961
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,440
Dad, mom

962
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,480
I'm here to pick up He.

963
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
Don't rush to call us that.

964
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,400
Have you brought that red envelope?

965
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,720
Mom, dad, let me explain.

966
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,440
You just told me about this

967
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,120
yesterday.

968
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,360
I can't get the money

969
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,240
in one day.

970
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,800
What?

971
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,960
This wedding is not yet held

972
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,960
how dare you lie to us?

973
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,400
You are not sincere at all.

974
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,840
Yes, no sincerity.

975
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,360
I...

976
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,400
You are not sincere at all.

977
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,920
Come in, hurry up!

978
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,120
Wait.

979
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,360
You are not allowed to see others.

980
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,680
What are you doing down here?

981
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,880
Retain your composure.

982
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,640
Go back.

983
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,360
Mom and Dad

984
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,280
if I don't take Buhe now

985
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,680
it's really too late for the wedding.

986
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,600
Today there are so many people from our two families.

987
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,960
If something went wrong

988
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,480
it would be so embarrassing for us.

989
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,240
Don't get married.

990
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,720
Buhe, Buhe

991
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,840
Buhe, I'm here to pick you up.

992
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,440
Buhe

993
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,000
You can't come in.

994
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,520
I only need a word from you now.

995
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,000
No matter who is stopping me

996
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,120
I will take you away. Buhe.

997
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,400
Buhe

998
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,880
What are you talking about?

999
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,160
Aunt, don't worry.

1000
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Let me ask him.

1001
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,200
Buhe

1002
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,720
Come with me.

1003
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,400
Why it's only you?

1004
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,840
Xiaoyu, I'm sorry.

1005
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,640
I really went to

1006
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
get the bouquet on time

1007
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
but I got stuck in traffic

1008
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,800
for ten minutes on the way here.

1009
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,680
I could have rolled here

1010
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
but the driver just didn't let me get off.

1011
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,480
I'm sorry.

1012
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,200
It's okay. They haven't arrived yet.

1013
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,880
Ah?

1014
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,800
Hasn't Nan Bei arrived yet?

1015
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,320
Didn't you give him an order

1016
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,040
to arrive at half past nine?

1017
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,640
If he couldn't make it before 9:58

1018
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
you would kill him.

1019
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,160
I think they should

1020
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,040
have this awareness.

1021
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,200
I already knew that

1022
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,880
the bride's relatives

1023
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,120
would not let them off easily.

1024
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,840
Have you heard that?

1025
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,960
The bridesmaids are very tough.

1026
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,280
So I have counted the time

1027
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,000
to pass this difficulty.

1028
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,920
If they are not here at this time

1029
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,760
he has no life

1030
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,640
to attend the wedding.

1031
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
I even doubled the time

1032
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,400
in traffic jams

1033
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,000
for them.

1034
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,480
Even if they roll, they should have rolled here.

1035
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,880
If he can not control the whole scene

1036
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
as a best man

1037
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,040
I don't know how bad

1038
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,640
his own wedding will be.

1039
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,480
Calm down.

1040
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,200
Take a look.

1041
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,680
This is their wedding.

1042
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,600
No need to be angry.

1043
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,280
When you get married in the future

1044
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
I will be the chief planner for you.

1045
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
Calm down, calm down.

1046
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,240
Life is a drama.

1047
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,000
This bastard

1048
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,880
dares to call me.

1049
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,760
Where are you?

1050
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,120
Escaped the wedding, right?

1051
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,960
You come to

1052
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,720
the dressing room now.

1053
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
Don't let others see you.

1054
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
It's almost late.

1055
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,920
What are you waiting for here?

1056
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,800
Yeah, where's the bride?

1057
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,200
I want to ask

1058
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,240
who of you can do me a favor

1059
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,280
to marry me for a while?

1060
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,600
What?

1061
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,840
I have paid for the wedding

1062
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
and hotel.

1063
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,000
My relatives and friends are here, too.

1064
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,640
I have also took their red envelopes.

1065
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,040
There is really

1066
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,000
no other way.

1067
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,200
I know

1068
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,400
this is too much

1069
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,920
but don't worry.

1070
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,120
Later

1071
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,480
you will wear the veil all the way

1072
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,320
the relatives and friends will

1073
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,240
definitely not be able to see you.

1074
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,440
We will just go through

1075
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,160
a procedure.

1076
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,520
When the toast comes

1077
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,920
I can come out by myself.

1078
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,160
I really can't

1079
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,640
let my parents

1080
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,840
lose face

1081
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,840
in such an important day.

1082
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,440
Of course

1083
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,400
if you refuse

1084
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,200
I can understand.

1085
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,600
After all, this matter

1086
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,360
has nothing to do

1087
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,840
with you.

1088
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,120
I'll do it.

1089
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,480
Really?

1090
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,720
Dango

1091
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,400
It's fine.

1092
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,240
If this happens to me

1093
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,640
I would even want to die.

1094
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,120
I understand you.

1095
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:11,880
Dango

1096
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,960
If Liu Yanze

1097
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,920
sees this

1098
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,720
he would...

1099
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,200
Dango, I support you.

1100
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,080
It doesn't matter.

1101
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,760
It's all fake anyway.

1102
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,920
Just a procedure.

1103
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Liu Yanze is not here.

1104
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,000
Even if he knew

1105
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
I believe he would support me.

1106
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,760
Thank you.

1107
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,920
Thank you so much.

1108
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,640
Well

1109
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,560
I'm going to pick up my parents now.

1110
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,200
Then I will communicate with the emcee

1111
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,080
to simplify the procedures as much as possible.

1112
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,040
Then

1113
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,040
if you can call

1114
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,960
some classmates here

1115
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,680
it would be even better

1116
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
because there are

1117
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,120
still two or three empty tables on the bride's side.

1118
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,120
Dango, thank you.

1119
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,200
Xiaoyu, I have to trouble you

1120
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,960
to pretend to be a bridesmaid.

1121
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,280
I have no problem.

1122
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,240
Thank you.

1123
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,160
Fine.

1124
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,840
Let's start our plan.

1125
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,800
Get out.

1126
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,160
Okay.

1127
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,440
Get started.

1128
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,080
Yeah.

1129
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,920
Liu Yanze, come here.

1130
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,120
You still remember me.

1131
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,600
What's the matter?

1132
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,400
There is a great thing.

1133
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,240
Is the bride pretty?

1134
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,640
Pretty or not?

1135
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,200
Nan Bei

1136
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,360
Go.

1137
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,280
What's the situation here?

1138
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,280
Situation... This is the situation.

1139
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Mainly because

1140
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
it's too late now.

1141
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,200
There is really nothing we can do.

1142
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,440
Xianyu

1143
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,800
What should we do?

1144
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,000
This dress is too big for me.

1145
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,320
I can't wear it.

1146
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,240
Just changed like that?

1147
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,080
Mainly because

1148
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,320
you will support and understand me.

1149
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,600
Just now you supported

1150
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,480
and understood Dango.

1151
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,920
I supported her

1152
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,440
because she's...

1153
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,800
Wait, wait.

1154
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
Why haven't you changed yet?

1155
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm sorry.

1156
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,280
The dress is too big.

1157
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,920
I have nothing to do.

1158
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,040
I can only be a bridesmaid.

1159
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,920
Xiaoyu

1160
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,280
Bro

1161
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,120
you are a real friend.

1162
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,480
In the future

1163
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,360
if you encounter any trouble

1164
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,600
tell me, I will be bound.

1165
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,400
Wait, wait, wait.

1166
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,160
She...

1167
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,960
I just...

1168
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,560
Time is running out.

1169
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,040
Let's go.

1170
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,720
This matter...

1171
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,520
I didn't...
