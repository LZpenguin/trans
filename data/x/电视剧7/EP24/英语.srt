Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP24

2
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,840
Bring me the pepper please.

3
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,040
Thank you.

4
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,760
Me too.

5
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,240
What are we going to do later?

6
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
Let me have a look.

7
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,640
How about this?

8
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
What's up?

9
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,800
Why are they all shopping,

10
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
watching movies

11
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,880
and eating dessert?

12
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,920
That's boring.

13
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,040
There's no place

14
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
to find something exciting.

15
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,760
I've played these before.

16
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,720
Who did you play with?

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Why do you care so much?

18
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,720
What are you two doing?

19
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
Eat spicy food.

20
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't flaunt your superiority.

21
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Don't be in the bathroom

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
all afternoon.

23
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
We still have to date.

24
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
Sorry, I can eat spicy food very well.

25
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,800
You forget it.

26
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,040
Last time you ate Sichuan dishes.

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,160
You've been allergic for a week.

28
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
Since I was with you,

29
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,960
allergic drugs are on standby.

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Xiaoyu, has your boyfriend's IQ

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,880
reached the pass line?

32
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,760
I don't know.

33
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
How about

34
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,320
karting?

35
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,360
I always want to drive

36
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
but I don't have a driver's license.

37
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,160
I think I can try this.

38
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,920
This is okay.

39
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,840
This one has a special track.

40
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm fine.

41
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,120
How about you two?

42
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,160
How about karting?

43
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,120
Okay.

44
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,560
I,

45
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
I like to play karting.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,480
That's it.

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
Pass unanimously.

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
We have something to do now.

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,240
Before we go,

50
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
we can watch a movie first.

51
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,080
Okay.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,840
If time is enough,

53
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
I think we can go bungee jumping.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,600
This is specially prepared

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,000
for you two.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,960
I think it's good.

57
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,560
At that time,

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
you can push each other down.

59
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,360
If you are lucky,

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,080
you will never see

61
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,960
the other person tomorrow.

62
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,720
No problem.

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,320
What do you mean by saying that?

64
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
What's fun

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
about karting?

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,960
Let's go bungee jumping.

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,440
We have a new

68
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,960
set here.

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
Do you want to know about it?

70
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,040
No, thank you.

71
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,560
Thank you.

72
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,280
Have you decided?

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
I want two tickets for that one.

74
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,280
This one.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,600
You see.

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
"The Invisible Guest".

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
This one has a good reputation.

78
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,520
It feels like the modern texture

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
of Agatha's novels.

80
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,160
As a suspense inferential film,

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,720
the rhythm is compact, and the plot is full of ups and downs.

82
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
Towards the end,

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,880
the truth was revealed suddenly.

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,960
This top film review on Douban

85
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,120
is written by me.

86
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,720
The most handsome of DUFE.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
Don't you feel ashamed?

88
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
I was in Spain

89
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
when I watched the Spanish version

90
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
of the film.

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
Why don't you stay there?

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Do you think Liu Yanze

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
is quite similar to Nan Bei?

94
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,920
I feel both of them are silly.

95
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,640
We're miserable.

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,400
We make a contribution to others.

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,440
Let's go to eat delicious food.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,360
Okay?

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Sure.

100
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,560
Okay, let's go.

101
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,120
Look, does this suit me?

102
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
You look good in this.

103
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,840
Come on.

104
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,960
Be gentle.

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,360
You see

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
the red one.

107
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,040
I was also called

108
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
the great race driver.

109
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,520
Don't be afraid, Xiaoyu.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,440
I tell you.

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
When turning,

112
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,840
you can see the curve

113
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,120
according to your speed.

114
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,320
Be careful. Remember to brake.

115
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,200
Braking

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
is the key and fundamental to drift.

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,080
Dango, don't be afraid.

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,280
When turning,

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
your body leans to

120
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,040
which side you take.

121
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
In this way, the center of gravity of your body

122
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,880
can offset part of

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,960
the centrifugal force of turning.

124
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,240
Are you playing karting?

125
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,640
Do you think

126
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,720
you can pick up props on the track?

127
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
Can you still drift

128
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
by pressing the shift button?

129
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,240
Can you drive?

130
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Which one shall we play?

131
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,160
I think we

132
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,280
choose an elementary one.

133
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,080
I'm afraid I can't play well.

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
It doesn't matter, Zishi.

135
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
As long as you follow my train of thought,

136
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
we can definitely come out.

137
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
It shows your ability.

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
If you don't follow me,

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,080
I'm afraid you'll get trapped inside.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,360
Let's choose the twelfth.

141
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,120
Xiaoyu

142
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
Let's play the sixth.

143
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,360
What do you mean?

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,360
We don't play together, right?

145
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,160
No.

146
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm afraid that some people

147
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
will slow down my speed.

148
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm afraid we both come out

149
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,120
and you are still trapped inside.

150
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,760
Go.

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,600
Wow

152
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,280
Isn't this cool?

153
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,440
Wow

154
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,800
Nan Bei

155
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,200
What is the contradiction

156
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,320
between you and Liu Yanze?

157
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Why are you so awkward?

158
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,800
That has to start with the joint military training

159
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,440
between our university

160
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,640
and Western University of Science and Technology.

161
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
Liu Yanze and I were

162
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,600
assigned to a dormitory.

163
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,920
Nan Bei, your water.

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
I want warm water at 50 degrees.

165
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,360
This is at 70 degrees.

166
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
You're going to burn me.

167
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm sorry, Nan Bei.

168
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
It's my mistake.

169
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Please pardon me.

170
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
Please forgive me.

171
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,880
Nan Bei

172
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,120
Please be serious.

173
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,040
Stop daydreaming.

174
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,760
Okay?

175
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,560
Ah.

176
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,120
I just add a little drama.

177
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,440
Come on. Be serious.

178
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
And then...

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
Nan Bei

180
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,440
The girls of the broadcasting department

181
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,080
are training on the playground.

182
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
Do you want to go and have a look together?

183
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,160
Look at beautiful girls, right?

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,880
You're still looking at beautiful girls.

185
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,480
No, no.

186
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,720
No.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,640
I didn't know you

188
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,000
yet.

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,200
Besides, before I saw the beauties,

190
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,480
I went straight back to the dormitory.

191
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,680
You give my wife back.

192
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,680
You return my wife.

193
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,960
You return my wife.

194
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,760
You are foolish.

195
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
You...

196
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
Come here! Don't go!

197
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,640
Don't go!

198
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,680
Come here!

199
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,640
Come on!

200
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,760
Ah...

201
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,080
It's just a video game console.

202
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,760
What's the big deal?

203
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,520
Game console is a small thing.

204
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,520
But there are my archives in it.

205
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,400
Shi Zhi,

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,680
Wei Xu,

207
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,600
Shan Cai...

208
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Who are they?

209
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,200
My wives.

210
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,640
That's what I spent

211
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,720
hundreds of days and nights.

212
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,200
I read all the strategies,

213
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,680
spent all the time,

214
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,000
and bought all the gifts

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,880
to make their heart rate

216
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
reach the highest.

217
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,160
That's my first love memory.

218
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,040
Nan Bei

219
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,480
I thought I was your first love.

220
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,400
But I didn't expect you to be married.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,720
Ah!

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,040
That's the Two-dimensional.

223
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,960
The Two-dimensional is different.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,960
You are disgusting.

225
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,200
What do you know?

226
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
That's a man's romance, okay?

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,720
In short,

228
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,160
from that day on,

229
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
I lost my love forever.

230
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,720
From that day on,

231
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,240
Liu Yanze and I have being incompatible.

232
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,520
Nan Bei, you are so childish.

233
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
Oh, my God.

234
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,120
But you have me now.

235
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,480
I won't play that game anyway.

236
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
You're growing up.

237
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,000
Listen to me.

238
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,160
For Dango,

239
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
for our debate team,

240
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,040
make up with him.

241
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,000
I won't quarrel with him in the future.

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,480
Okay?

243
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,120
Yes.

244
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,200
You are a mature man now.

245
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,560
Senior

246
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
Why do you always

247
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
compete with Nan Bei?

248
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,920
Did you have any conflicts before?

249
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
That guy...

250
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,280
When we were freshmen in military training,

251
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,480
we're in the same dormitory.

252
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,120
Unexpected inspection.

253
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,000
The instructor is coming.

254
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,560
At that time, Nan Bei came back.

255
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,680
He misunderstood that I delete

256
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,040
the record of his game console.

257
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,560
I haven't had time to speak.

258
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
The instructor came in.

259
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,680
From then on, Nan Bei have held a grudge

260
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,840
against me.

261
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,640
And he keeps playing pranks on me.

262
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
Nan Bei is so childish.

263
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,800
So you're not going to

264
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,680
explain to him.

265
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,760
It's not your fault.

266
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,640
There's no need to explain.

267
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,520
But...

268
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,400
It's already over.

269
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,960
Anyway, I am not so angry

270
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,080
at his pranks anymore.

271
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,200
The door opens.

272
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,280
Let's go.

273
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,200
I forgive you.

274
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,160
What?

275
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,400
It's what happened at the time of military training.

276
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,800
I forgive you.

277
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,680
You were so childish at that time.

278
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,600
I won't dispute with you.

279
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,160
Hey, what's your attitude?

280
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,800
I said I forgive you.

281
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
You don't know to apologize to me.

282
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,360
Forget it.

283
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,240
Anyway, during military training,

284
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,920
your shoes

285
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,680
are hidden by me.

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,200
I cut your buttons.

287
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,320
I spilled the water, too.

288
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,480
What are you laughing at?

290
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,680
Then it's a tie.

291
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,880
Are you still pretending to be cool?

292
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,120
Liu Yanze, do you think

293
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,880
you're a handsome guy

294
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,800
by pretending to be cool?

295
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,680
I'm telling you,

296
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,560
your style is out of date.

297
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,200
Do you know?

298
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,560
Actually,

299
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,760
as the captain of team one,

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
I didn't unite

301
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,400
the relationship between team one and team two.

302
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,360
I'm also responsible.

303
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,200
So,

304
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,680
for the debate team,

305
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,480
and Zishi,

306
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,360
I won't have conflicts

307
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
with you anymore.

308
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,080
What are you pretending?

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,800
You still like to pretend to be cool.

310
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
What are they talking about? I can't hear.

311
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,400
Yeah, I don't know.

312
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,880
What are they talking about?

313
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,400
Forget it.

314
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,920
Let's just play by ourselves.

315
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
They won't fight.

316
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,240
Look, look over there.

317
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,600
There are so many cats in the store.

318
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
why do you like it?

319
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,760
Because other cats are very outgoing.

320
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,000
Only Charles is always

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,560
alone.

322
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,360
The more lonely it is,

323
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,840
the more I want to protect it

324
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,600
and take care of it.

325
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
It is so happy to have you.

326
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,400
It is also very happy to have you.

327
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,320
You can spoil it.

328
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm in charge of it,

329
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,960
just like mom and dad.

330
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
Okay.

331
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,720
There are two nails.

332
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Don't worry.

333
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,840
All right, let it go.

334
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,680
Here we are.

335
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,040
Then I'll go first.

336
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,760
See you tomorrow.

337
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,640
Oh.

338
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,240
Ma Nan

339
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,000
You are so cowardly.

340
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,240
Hey,

341
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,680
you get up early.

342
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,920
You're not strong enough

343
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,800
at a young age.

344
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,840
Didn't we three

345
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,600
withdraw together last night?

346
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Because we

347
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
played the game last night,

348
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,200
I didn't answer Xiaoyu's call.

349
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
She wants to break up with me again.

350
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,560
I searched

351
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,520
a hundred ways to apologize yesterday

352
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
before I coaxed her.

353
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,480
Hao didn't call you?

354
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
We're all adults.

355
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,920
She doesn't care about this.

356
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,120
We're sailing in the same boat.

357
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm not like you.

358
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
It has nothing to do with playing games.

359
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,840
I have a good chat

360
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,760
with my new girlfriend.

361
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,320
We talked all night.

362
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,840
I have to send a photo

363
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,760
to report my situation in real time.

364
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,080
Hey,

365
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,720
there are activities in the game at ten o'clock. Will you go?

366
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,360
Yes.

367
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,080
My girlfriend may not wake up now.

368
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,480
Why don't you ask me?

369
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,360
Okay.

370
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,440
Do you need to ask

371
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,200
Xiaoyu?

372
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,680
Hey,

373
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,200
since I become an adult,

374
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,160
I don't need to tell Xiaoyu.

375
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,000
Come on.

376
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,840
Go.

377
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,320
No, you can't.

378
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,880
hello

379
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,880
You wake up so early.

380
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,320
Don't drop the mouse, Dandan.

381
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,480
Okay.

382
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,200
Then I'll pick you up now.

383
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,480
Okay, I'm coming.

384
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm sorry, brothers.

385
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,440
I'll leaving now.

386
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
What happened?

387
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,480
What happened? You abandon your teammates.

388
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,760
My game is over.

389
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,680
Your phone is ringing.

390
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,200
Hey, I'm with Ma Nan.

391
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Does it have to be now?

392
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,200
Wait a minute.

393
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,760
Coming.

394
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,600
Brother, I have to stop now.

395
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,800
I'll leave it to you.

396
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,640
Wow

397
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,320
Good

398
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,600
Wow

399
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Come on.

400
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,400
Hello

401
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Where are you?

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,120
Would you like to have a meal together?

403
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm playing games.

404
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,160
What do you want to eat?

405
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,760
Then I won't bother you.

406
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,400
You can play first.

407
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,000
No.

408
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,440
Hero's journey is destined to be lonely.

409
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,080
Come on.

410
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,080
Xiaoyu, I'm wrong.

411
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,440
Why don't you answer my phone?

412
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm really wrong.

413
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,720
It's all because of Ma Nan.

414
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,120
He plays such a boring game

415
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,760
and has to collect

416
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,480
my cell phone.

417
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
You're late

418
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
again and again.

419
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,960
Is it a sprained ankle

420
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,160
or a twisted waist?

421
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,160
I...

422
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,080
When I cross the street,

423
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,600
I meet an old lady.

424
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I saw that the traffic light

425
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
was about to turn into a red light.

426
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,680
She's still standing in the middle of the road.

427
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,680
Do you think I can leave her alone?

428
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,040
I can't.

429
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,600
I must help her.

430
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,320
I must wait for

431
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,040
the next green light.

432
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,360
I wait for

433
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,480
five traffic lights.

434
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,240
Ten minutes passed.

435
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,840
Come on.

436
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,520
I just think

437
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,280
I have to run faster.

438
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,120
I can't let you

439
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,880
wait for me.

440
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,560
Right?

441
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,080
Ah...

442
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,280
Just when I was about to

443
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,920
sprint for 100 meters,

444
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,560
guess what?

445
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,800
What did I hear?

446
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,880
You heard someone scolding you.

447
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,920
I heard three kittens

448
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,680
in the grass.

449
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,400
They're screaming badly.

450
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,880
Then I went to the shop

451
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,480
to buy some milk

452
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,040
and sausage.

453
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,760
I feed them.

454
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,440
I thought that

455
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm late.

456
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,360
Although I'm late,

457
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,080
our Xiaoyu

458
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,800
will never be angry with me

459
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,320
because

460
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,080
I save small animals.

461
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,720
Am I right?

462
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
Why don't you be a screenwriter?

463
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,720
Hey,

464
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,000
the requirements of screenwriter are too easy.

465
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,360
I don't care.

466
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm wrong.

467
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,360
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,120
What's your mistake?

469
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,240
I'm wrong in everything.

470
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
You have no sincerity at all.

471
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,640
I'm sincere.

472
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
About my reasons for late,

473
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,560
What do you think is the problem?

474
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,080
Nan Bei, I'm telling you...

475
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,080
Look.

476
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,720
I really

477
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,680
went to buy sausage.

478
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,280
I didn't lie to you.

479
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,800
Come on.

480
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,320
Xiaoyu

481
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Let's stop

482
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,760
talking about

483
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,920
breakup from now on.

484
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,640
You won't leave me alone.

485
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,840
Okay.

486
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,760
Our civil law adjusts

487
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,040
the social relations

488
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,000
between equal subjects.

489
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,240
However,

490
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,520
not all social relations

491
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,640
between equal subjects

492
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
are adjusted by civil law.

493
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,240
China's civil law

494
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,200
only adjusts...

495
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,760
What?

496
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,440
The property relationship and personal relationship.

497
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
That's the relationship

498
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,520
we call...

499
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,120
Civil relations.

500
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
Yes, that's right.

501
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,120
How to correctly

502
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,320
adjust civil relations?

503
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm going to

504
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,160
test you here.

505
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
I can't understand your class.

506
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,560
Why do you have to let me accompany you?

507
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,880
I usually accompany you.

508
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,400
I hope you can stay with me this time.

509
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,360
Come on.

510
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,120
Otherwise, our classmates

511
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,160
don't even know I have a girlfriend.

512
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,600
It's so shameless, isn't it?

513
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,240
I can testify.

514
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,400
Nan Bei tells everyone

515
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,080
you take the initiative to chase him.

516
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
But no one believes him.

517
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,040
He assures everyone that

518
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,840
he will bring you here

519
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,000
to show others.

520
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,000
What's wrong?

521
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,600
Too fast. I didn't see it.

522
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,400
Too fast.

523
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,040
Can you be a little polite to me?

524
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,880
Anyway, I'm quite famous

525
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,680
in the class.

526
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,440
What's going on?

527
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,080
Ah...

528
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,280
Xiaoyu

529
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
When will we

530
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
have a fellowship with your team?

531
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,120
Call Dango and Hao.

532
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,800
It's late.

533
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
Everyone has a partner

534
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,000
except Sa.

535
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
What a pity.

536
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,840
Okay, let's stop for a minute.

537
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,160
Let me say something first.

538
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,880
Every year, our college

539
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,120
has several places for internships in the service center.

540
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,440
The purpose

541
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,760
is to help students

542
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,880
apply the knowledge

543
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,840
learned in books

544
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,080
to our

545
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,480
practical services.

546
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,760
Our class

547
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
also has a quota.

548
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,440
The student

549
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,320
I called

550
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,320
starts to

551
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,400
report to the service center tomorrow.

552
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
It can't be you, can it?

553
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,080
How could it be me？

554
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,360
We have to prepare for the debate.

555
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,400
Besides,

556
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,920
this probability is one-fiftieth.

557
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,680
If I were so lucky,

558
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,000
I would have married Ayaka Miyoshi.

559
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,840
Nan Bei

560
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,440
Ah.

561
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,680
Report for duty tomorrow.

562
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,600
Ayaka Miyoshi is not as good-looking as you.

563
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,320
What's the matter?

564
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
Too fast. I can't see it.

565
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,040
Come with me, please.

566
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,960
No.

567
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,880
Anyway, your teacher

568
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,080
also asks you

569
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,600
to participate in internship.

570
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,520
I major in international trade.

571
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
Why do I go there?

572
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,600
Even if I go to the service center,

573
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,760
it doesn't count.

574
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
I don't want to waste time.

575
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,960
You can imagine

576
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,200
those who come to the service center

577
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,840
to solve the problem

578
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,440
have trivial matters.

579
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,840
Those are trivial things in life, like relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law,

580
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,480
and all kinds of

581
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,400
unexpected plots.

582
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,680
This is simply a party

583
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,520
of various people.

584
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,080
Nan Bei

585
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,760
This kind of family chore

586
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,680
suits you best.

587
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,520
I won't go

588
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
to join the trouble.

589
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,600
You will know

590
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,480
how important

591
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,440
speed and eloquence are.

592
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,160
How to seriously block the mouth

593
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,320
of various people?

594
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,560
That is simply an art.

595
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,720
Have you ever seen anyone

596
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,600
who can speak more than they can?

597
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,920
Why do sows scream late at night?

598
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,240
Why does the hair salon suddenly catch fire?

599
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
Why does Zhang suddenly disappear?

600
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
Is it the loss of morality

601
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,880
or the lack of human nature?

602
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,720
These signs

603
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,800
and reasoning

604
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,760
rapidly

605
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,760
enhance our ability of logical thinking.

606
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,720
You

607
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,600
take an example

608
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,240
on the debate.

609
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,200
Which opponent can answer?

610
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,120
All right.

611
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,280
I'll accompany you for a while.

612
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,280
If we pool our efforts together,

613
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,120
we can achieve anything.

614
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,880
Come on.

615
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,280
Maintain my image.

616
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,240
Dango

617
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
Hao

618
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
I'm going to

619
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,760
see the exhibition in the afternoon with Liu Yanze.

620
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,720
I won't go to you.

621
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,320
It's okay. Go ahead.

622
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
Anyway,

623
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,800
I don't plan to train.

624
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,480
Where shall we go this afternoon?

625
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,760
I'll go wherever you go.

626
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,800
Zishi, there are something on your hand.

627
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,880
Hey,

628
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,040
show us your sweetness.

629
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
Hao, I'll hang up first.

630
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,280
Bye.

631
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,320
It's a little disgusting.

632
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,880
I've got goose bumps.

633
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Then you save body lotion.

634
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,720
Do you like this?

635
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,800
What?

636
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,840
I mean

637
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
girl like Dango.

638
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,840
Like Dango?

639
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,480
I don't know. I haven't tried it.

640
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,520
Why don't you try it?

641
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,800
Where shall we go later?

642
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,000
Anywhere.

643
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,680
I want to eat hot pot today.

644
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,240
Will you go with me?

645
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,680
Sure.

646
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,800
I can't open it.

647
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,040
Come on.

648
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm joking with you.

649
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,960
I still prefer

650
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,080
the original you.

651
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,320
At least it's not annoying.

652
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,440
Hao

653
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,840
Hao

654
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,280
Where are you going?

655
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,240
If it's training, I didn't say it.

656
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,320
I'll take Tao Hao to eat.

657
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,760
Let's go together.

658
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,080
Is it your treat?

659
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll go if you treat me.

660
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
On me.

661
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,280
Let's go.

662
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,120
Go.

663
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,560
Hello

664
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,320
Now I...

665
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm not as important as

666
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,040
a cell phone.

667
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,560
Right?

668
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,480
I've been studying photography recently.

669
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,400
When do you

670
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,120
begin to study photography?

671
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,880
I don't even know.

672
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Now.

673
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,600
You should say

674
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,320
ever since I was with you.

675
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,800
To make you look better,

676
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,480
I just decided to study photography.

677
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,560
Look at us.

678
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,320
You're really

679
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,920
not romantic at all.

680
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,040
I'm different from

681
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,960
you guys.

682
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,200
Action speaks louder than words.

683
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,400
What are you eating?

684
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,960
This is ice.

685
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,640
Your menstruation will come in a few days.

686
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,880
If you feel uncomfortable,

687
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,120
I have to bear it.

688
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,080
So sweet.

689
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,800
What's up?

690
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,320
Come on.

691
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,560
It's definitely because

692
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,120
you haven't been in love for too long.

693
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,320
Are you flattered?

694
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,280
That's cool, Hao.

695
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,720
Take the initiative.

696
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,280
I think

697
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,560
there is nothing to care

698
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,920
about feeding.

699
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,840
Have you ever heard of

700
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,880
male territorial consciousness?

701
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,080
It might sound a little bit

702
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,680
strange.

703
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,280
But

704
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,440
this is an instinctive reaction.

705
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,280
It's just that one side is stronger and the other is weaker.

706
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,920
In ancient society,

707
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,600
the same-sex consciousness

708
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,640
of competing for territory

709
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
has long been engraved in their hearts.

710
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,920
Just like

711
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,600
the elevator effect.

712
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Once people enter the elevator,

713
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,000
they will imperceptibly

714
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,960
set a safe distance.

715
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Once the others enter,

716
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,920
the safe distance

717
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,880
will move with them.

718
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,960
This is the universal sense of territory.

719
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,840
So I

720
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,000
admire you very much.

721
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,440
What are you doing?

722
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,840
Go into your territory and have a look.

723
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,680
It's so cold.

724
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,600
You have always been in my territory.

725
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,520
You can't run away.

726
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,920
Did I say too much

727
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,520
at the dessert shop?

728
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,680
No.

729
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,080
I was worried that I wasn't doing well.

730
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,520
You feel embarrassed.

731
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,240
Am I

732
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,880
not good at playing the coquetry?

733
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,400
Tao Hao, I think

734
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,120
you don't have to

735
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,960
change for me.

736
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
What I like

737
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,360
is you.

738
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,200
Besides,

739
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,600
if you're not good at playing the coquetry,

740
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
I can do it for you.

741
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,520
It's so dark.

742
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,760
I'm a little scared.

743
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,320
How is it?

744
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
It feels good.

745
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,680
That's good.

746
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,080
This debate

747
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,040
is already

748
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,160
a common topic.

749
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,720
But combined with daily life,

750
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,600
without exception,

751
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,000
they are all defeated by their girlfriends.

752
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,840
Do you have any ideas?

753
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,640
I think there is something wrong with this resolution.

754
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
Why do you have to give up one side?

755
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,920
This is the implicit message.

756
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Every resolution

757
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,120
has implicit conditions.

758
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,280
Take this resolution as an example.

759
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,360
This resolution

760
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,040
must be set in a situation.

761
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,880
That is, if

762
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,440
your girlfriend

763
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,400
calls you

764
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
while you are playing a game,

765
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,120
are you going to answer it or not?

766
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,480
But

767
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
it didn't say this.

768
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,120
Can't I make an argument

769
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
to blame my girlfriend

770
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,680
but it has nothing to do with the game.

771
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,520
In this case,

772
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,720
the other side

773
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,400
can't break my argument.

774
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,680
Then you can't break others' argument.

775
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
Debate must have

776
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,280
the significance of it.

777
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,880
You're completely

778
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,800
avoiding the important and dwell on the trivial.

779
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,200
It's meaningless, you know?

780
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,360
I think we should give up girlfriend.

781
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,160
You think,

782
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,840
there are priorities.

783
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,320
When playing a game, it doesn't have a pause button

784
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,120
and can't stop.

785
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,800
Maybe it's not urgent

786
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,400
for your girlfriend

787
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
to call you.

788
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,400
This is an idea.

789
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,600
How to refute it?

790
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,400
If this game is lost,

791
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,960
we can have another round.

792
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,840
If your girlfriend dumps you...

793
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,240
Then we can find another one.

794
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,280
Senior,

795
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,800
how would you refute it?

796
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,760
If I'm debating,

797
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,680
I will say like this.

798
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,960
My fellow debater,

799
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,600
if you don't even know that

800
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,320
your girlfriend's affairs

801
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,400
are major events,

802
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,960
I am very worried about

803
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,800
your future love.

804
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,440
Senior, do you have a girlfriend?

805
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,480
Of course.

806
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,640
But my girlfriend

807
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,880
is relatively weak

808
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
in life.

809
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,920
She can't take care of herself.

810
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,880
I am her lighthouse

811
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,280
in the sea.

812
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,280
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

813
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,920
There are so many people here.

814
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,560
Help me save my image.

815
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,680
Which girlfriend of yours

816
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
is too weak to take care of herself?

817
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,640
Of course, I'm talking about you,

818
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,040
who are kind, beautiful, smart and generous.

819
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm complimenting you here.

820
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
By the way, set up my image as a man.

821
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,680
In order to establish your own image,

822
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,800
you spread rumors outside, right?

823
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,960
Break up.

824
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,880
No.

825
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,800
Why do you break up again?

826
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,720
We can't break up.

827
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Why?

828
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,000
I won't be separated from you.

829
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,320
Hurry up.

830
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,640
We have to report to the service center.

831
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,680
Oh.

832
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,240
In my opinion,

833
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,440
it's okay to make a bowl of rice at night.

834
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,760
I'm getting old and I can't sleep well.

835
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
I am woken up by your doorbell every night.

836
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,320
Are you nuts?

837
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,600
You do this every time you go out.

838
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,040
Keep your head down

839
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,600
and play with your phone at any time.

840
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,160
You...

841
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,120
What's wrong with me?

842
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,560
Tell me

843
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,960
if you have another boyfriend outside.

844
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,920
You and I are diagonally opposite.

845
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,120
Not to mention anything else,

846
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,080
the doorbell

847
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,720
is so small that I can't even hear it.

848
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,600
I have asked the takeaway

849
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,560
to call me.

850
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,760
I just want to know

851
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,160
how you hear it.

852
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,440
How did you

853
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,400
hear it?

854
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,120
What?

855
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
That's my job.

856
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,440
Leaders come to me at any time.

857
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,880
I'm tired

858
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,520
after going back from work every day.

859
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,320
you still treat me

860
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,240
with this attitude.

861
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,800
If you want to break up,

862
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,720
don't make excuses.

863
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,640
Speak directly.

864
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,760
He said

865
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,840
he doesn't ring the doorbell.

866
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,080
He asks the takeaway to call him directly.

867
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,200
Ah?

868
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,360
He said he doesn't ring the doorbell.

869
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,640
He asks the takeaway to call him directly.

870
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,760
He has to make Ciba at night?

871
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
It's too noisy. No.

872
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Maybe you can't look at this thing

873
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,280
like this.

874
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,040
Don't look at it that way.

875
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,240
How do you look at it otherwise?

876
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,080
Do I look horizontally

877
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,840
or vertically?

878
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,800
This afternoon

879
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,560
I drank five bottles of water.

880
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
I didn't expect it to be manual labor.

881
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,400
I came here to practice my throat.

882
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

883
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,160
There is a couple this afternoon.

884
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,280
The man cheated and wanted to get divorced.

885
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,520
So?

886
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,880
So

887
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,000
if you are like this

888
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,680
in the future,

889
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,640
I will let you feel

890
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,600
what the dual stimulation

891
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,480
of spirit and body is.

892
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,040
What does this have to do with me?

893
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,720
Can you trust me a little?

894
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,680
Think about my merits.

895
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,840
For example,

896
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,000
we will live together till old and gray.

897
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
You talk about

898
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,120
the breakup all day long.

899
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,040
If we really break up,

900
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,080
where can you find

901
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,560
a good man like me?
