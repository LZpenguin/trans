00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,200
Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP11

2
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,120
-I'm sorry.  -Stop.

3
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,200
Hao

4
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,360
Why should you apologize to us?

5
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,400
You don't know

6
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,800
how cool you were just now.

7
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,640
After you left,

8
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,000
the students here were blue in the face.

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm so scared just now

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,360
that my heart virtually burst out of my chest.

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,160
Hao

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,400
You know what,

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,040
Mr. Li

14
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
at that time

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,640
was blue in the face for a while

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,720
and then was black in the face.

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
This is the effect of rehabilitation training.

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,320
But the question is

19
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,760
how they know

20
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
we were in the competition.

21
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,440
They must have noticed

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
the league.

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
I still can't believe that

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,960
the senior is such a person.

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,720
I don't think he did that.

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,200
Why can't you see through him?

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,000
He's just a polished scoundrel, okay?

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,640
That's enough.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,280
Don't listen to his nonsense, Dango.

30
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,920
I think it's a thing about the whole team.

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
It's not up to one person to decide.

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,200
It's useless

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,080
if he opposes it alone.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:53,840
Right?

35
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,360
Besides,

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,080
now that they

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,280
already have this idea,

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
even if we

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,440
report it to the school at that time,

40
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,000
they'll still compete with us anyway.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,760
Right.

42
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Just now

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,200
I left on an impulse.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,200
Now

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,040
we need to be calm and rational.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Because we certainly

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,240
won't give the league to others.

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,200
We've been preparing for this for a long time.

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,360
How can we

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
just give it to others?

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,320
Now let's figure out

52
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,920
how to enter the league.

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,600
Hao

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
You send me a copy of

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,680
competition system and schedule.

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,240
I'll see what loopholes

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,360
I can find.

58
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,400
Hao

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,880
It is OK.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,920
We'll go through

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,640
the difficulties together.

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,760
Look, this is...

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Your transformation plan worked.

64
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,200
In fact, it's not

65
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,320
your job.

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,120
You still said no.

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,240
It's not just the effect of the transformation plan.

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,720
I didn't think so much at that time.

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
I just couldn't stand the fact that

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,480
we all worked so hard,

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,600
but they still

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
thought nothing of us.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,680
So

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,240
I can give you an

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,040
extra reward.

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,120
What?

77
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,720
You don't have to serve team one anymore.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
So you must have plenty of time for yourself.

79
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,440
You can spend it on yourself.

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,440
Are there any places you want to go

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,320
that you haven't yet been able to visit?

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,280
Aquarium,

83
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,520
Botanical Garden,

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,320
Zoo,

85
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,440
Museum,

86
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,320
and several shopping malls.

87
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,120
Enough, enough.

88
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Although it is an extra reward,

89
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
I can only accompany you to one place.

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,600
You think about it carefully.

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,520
The old coach says that

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,240
he supports our decision.

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,600
I told you.

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
He must be on our side.

95
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,720
Oh.

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,760
Hey.

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,680
Discount.

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,400
Hey.

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,600
It's great.

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,080
Let's have a talk.

101
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,880
I have a competition tomorrow.

102
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,400
It won't take you long.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,560
You go ahead.

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,160
I've been thinking a lot these days.

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,880
I think

106
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,120
we'd better calm down

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,720
for a while.

108
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Just hear me out.

109
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,080
I didn't mean to break up.

110
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
I just think

111
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
we've had a lot things

112
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,280
going on these days.

113
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,720
You and I both need some time

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,360
to think it over, right?

115
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,800
I agree.

116
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Well, I'll go first.

117
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,720
Well, I...

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,880
We are just...

119
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,280
friends.

120
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
He's here to see what you mean, right?

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,880
Yeah.

122
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Have you decided yet?

123
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,040
At the beginning,

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
we were really together

125
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,320
because we liked each other.

126
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,800
But it wasn't long

127
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,800
before we realized that

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,120
we weren't really right for each other.

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,480
But you know how I am.

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,760
I've been trying to

131
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
cater to him

132
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,280
and adapt to him.

133
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,640
After all, it's

134
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,040
not hard for me.

135
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,440
He also had a lot of complaints.

136
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,920
But because I've been catering to him

137
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
and humouring him,

138
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,160
so

139
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
He may not bear to say goodbye.

140
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,600
Are you tired?

141
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,320
A little.

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,400
But

143
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,360
there is a run-in period

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,440
when two people get together.

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
After all, no two people

146
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
are born right to each other.

147
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,040
Your words

148
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,800
are no different than

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,720
saying the earth is round.

150
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,720
It's basically nonsense.

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,360
Remember

152
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,160
what we told you before?

153
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,440
It doesn't matter what his ups and downs are.

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
What matters is how you feel.

155
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,160
It's how you feel that matters.

156
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,840
Understand?

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,160
Okay.

158
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,640
Thank you for walking me home.

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,240
Bye bye.

160
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,040
Senior Ma Nan

161
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,440
Do you also want to read it?

162
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,760
I remember

163
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,320
one episode of Conan

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,200
where a team

165
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,280
kidnapped

166
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,680
the younger brother of the opposing ace player

167
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,920
in order to win.

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,600
You see, why don't we also...

169
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,960
It's not a good idea.

170
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,720
I major in law.

171
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,360
That will be sentenced.

172
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
There is also a theatrical version

173
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
where a singer

174
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
drank a special drug

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,520
and couldn't speak for three days.

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
Why don't we

177
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,280
sneak into their dormitory?

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,280
And then...

179
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,520
Did you hear

180
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
what you said?

181
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,160
Oops.

182
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,400
There's nothing I can do.

183
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,320
What can you do?

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,920
There is one actually.

185
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
Stop bragging.

186
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,880
What will you do

187
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,960
if I get this done?

188
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,680
Oh.

189
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,320
If you really get this done,

190
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,760
I'll call you Dad for a week.

191
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,400
Okay.

192
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
You can count on me.

193
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,680
You just have to prepare for the competition.

194
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,200
Are you ready?

195
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Let's go.

196
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,640
Background music for the entrance.

197
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,080
Why are they here?

198
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,240
They are just envious.

199
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,920
Later the captain

200
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,880
will show them

201
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,360
what is self-limitation.

202
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,480
Let them know what their limitations are.

203
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,400
Chief judge

204
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,680
We find that

205
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,760
the players of DUFE

206
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
don't match the registration list.

207
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,880
The registration list is

208
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Tao Hao, Ma Nan,

209
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,240
Mu Xiaoyu and Nan Bei,

210
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,960
which doesn't match the current players here.

211
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,000
According to regulations,

212
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,480
we have the right to suspend the competition.

213
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,720
Oops.

214
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Coach Wang, long time no see.

215
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,880
I heard that

216
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,080
Fulin is determined to

217
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
win the championship this time.

218
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,800
You are...

219
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,320
Yeah, Yeah.

220
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,240
But I heard that the requirements for the Points Race

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,160
are particularly strict.

222
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,760
Fortunately,

223
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,520
we compete with team two.

224
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,600
I heard that their team one

225
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,480
hasn't lost a competition in several years

226
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,840
in a row.

227
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,280
If Fulin

228
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,560
loses in Points Match,

229
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
it would be too demoralizing.

230
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,480
Hmm.

231
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,600
Coach Wang

232
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,200
If it wasn't for my stomach

233
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,360
at the time of recruitment,

234
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,240
I would have won honor for Fuling now.

235
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,160
Although

236
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,240
the strength of our team

237
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,400
is quite strong,

238
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,400
will exposing

239
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,360
all the strength

240
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
so early affect our chance of winning this year?

241
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,360
Maybe

242
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,080
we should save our strength.

243
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
What the hell?

244
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,040
How could the opponent know

245
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
our internal affairs?

246
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,680
It has been confirmed that

247
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,040
the participants of Team NEG

248
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,400
don't match the registration list.

249
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
According to the rules of the Match,

250
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,080
both sides should

251
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
strictly abide by the rules.

252
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,480
But because they are from the same school.

253
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,120
So if the original team members

254
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,840
have special reasons,

255
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,240
they can report to the organizer.

256
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,160
And the live debate team can replace them.

257
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,800
May I ask the original debate team members

258
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,120
have any questions?

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,240
Chief judge

260
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,240
Our debate team

261
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
has no special reason.

262
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,280
Coincidentally,

263
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,480
we even bring our clothes.

264
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,360
Background music of leaving.

265
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,560
You also don't leave.

266
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,640
Since I'm here,

267
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,880
just stay and have a look.

268
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,440
Hello, everyone.

269
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,400
Welcome to

270
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,840
final eight of

271
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,000
the Qiyi Cup College Students Debate Tournament.

272
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,960
This match

273
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,120
will be broadcasted live

274
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,320
on the city's educational channel.

275
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,360
Now I declare that

276
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,320
the match officially starts.

277
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,000
Yanze

278
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,040
You will preside over the replay.

279
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,120
Okay.

280
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,720
Let's talk about the angle first.

281
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
Team two has an advantage in this topic.

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,560
Setting public image

283
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,800
is a typical marketing.

284
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
And people

285
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
naturally have

286
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,080
negative feelings about marketing.

287
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,040
Not necessarily.

288
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
Don't you like watching Li Jiaqi

289
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
who sells goods through livestreaming?

290
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,320
There has been

291
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,200
a similar debate before

292
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,800
about whether the entertainment stars

293
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
should be criticized for setting public image.

294
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,320
But if we apply

295
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,960
this phenomenon

296
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,560
to

297
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,480
the average people,

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,160
people will talk more about

299
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,120
the kind of behaviors

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
we use to label ourselves

301
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,120
on our moments

302
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,520
and social media platforms.

303
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,400
And people will unconsciously

304
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,400
try to rationalize

305
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,000
their various actions.

306
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
So team two is easy to lose advantage.

307
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Most people will instead

308
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
support the public image

309
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
and think it's

310
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
a harmless thing.

311
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,360
Yes.

312
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,600
I think this point is really well

313
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,640
in argument of Team AFF.

314
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,520
We will begin with the opening argument

315
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,920
of the first debater from Team AFF

316
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,080
which will last three minutes.

317
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,560
Please.

318
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,320
Thank you, chief judge.

319
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,120
Hello, everyone.

320
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
Our view is that the advantages of

321
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,680
setting public image outweigh its disadvantages.

322
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,360
We often see the news in our lives

323
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,160
that the public image of some entertainment stars

324
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,520
are ruined,

325
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,440
and often

326
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,920
set some public images

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,640
for ourselves

328
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,600
in our circle of friends.

329
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,720
What exactly is setting public image?

330
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,800
We believe that

331
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,160
setting public image

332
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,360
is a kind of image management

333
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,160
in the era of social network.

334
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,680
It's not that different from

335
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,200
how we express ourselves

336
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,560
through dressing and speaking,

337
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
or making

338
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,880
a well-crafted resume

339
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,040
to apply for a job.

340
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,520
They are all managing our image

341
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,200
in the eyes of others

342
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
to present a better version

343
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,360
of ourselves.

344
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,440
This point is down to earth.

345
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
It is quite normal to dress appropriately

346
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
or embellish the resume,

347
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,640
thus leading the audience to agree with

348
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,920
setting public image.

349
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,160
In today's complex

350
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,120
social division of labor,

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,400
a marketer

352
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,680
may be exposed to more people

353
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,400
and information in a day

354
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
than throughout a lifetime

355
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,680
in an agricultural society.

356
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,960
And the phenomenon of public image

357
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
in social networks

358
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,960
greatly solves

359
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,800
the problem.

360
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,280
It uses simple settings

361
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,520
to outline our image,

362
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
so that the cognition between people

363
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
is fast and concrete.

364
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
By checking your Weibo

365
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
and updating your WeChat Moments,

366
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
I'll know roughly

367
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,360
a lot of information about you.

368
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,600
Setting public image has virtually improved

369
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,320
the social efficiency of the whole society.

370
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
This is another benefit.

371
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,880
To sum up,

372
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,120
we firmly believe that

373
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
the advantages of setting public image outweigh its disadvantages.

374
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,640
Thank you.

375
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,320
The definition of image management

376
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,720
confuses the purpose of setting public image.

377
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
And then they put the public image

378
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,880
equal to the goal.

379
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm afraid it will keep our arguments

380
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,720
from hitting the nail on the head.

381
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,680
The two arguments of the opponent are profound.

382
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,120
Let's start by the wrong relation between public image and goals.

383
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,400
Argue image management first.

384
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Thanks for the wonderful argument

385
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,080
of the first debater from Team AFF.

386
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,640
Now let's welcome the first debater from Team NEG

387
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,000
to make an opening argument,

388
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,600
also with a time limit of three minutes.

389
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,080
Welcome.

390
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,800
Thank you, chief judge.

391
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,960
Hello, everyone.

392
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
Just now, my fellow debater told us

393
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,600
that setting public image

394
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,840
improves our social efficiency

395
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,200
and reduces our communication cost,

396
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
which seems right at first glance.

397
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
So we met for the first time,

398
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,560
you added my WeChat

399
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,200
to check my Moments

400
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,840
and found I am a Taurus with type A blood

401
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,760
and like eating Italian food,

402
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,160
literature and art, and painting.

403
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,480
You seemed to

404
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,720
know me very well immediately

405
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,280
with a swipe of your fingers,

406
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,360
which is really efficient.

407
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,960
So you excitedly

408
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,440
took me to see

409
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
the Banksy's exhibition

410
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,640
and to eat expensive Italian food.

411
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,000
You arranged everything strongly

412
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,200
because I'm a Taurus,

413
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,800
who is indecisive

414
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,920
likes to let others make the decisions.

415
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
But that's not

416
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,040
who I really am.

417
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,560
That's just the shadow

418
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,120
of my public image,

419
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,840
the way

420
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I want to be seen by everyone.

421
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,080
Under this condition,

422
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm not happy.

423
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,440
But I can't show my true self

424
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,560
in front of you,

425
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,160
because I have to maintain my public image

426
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,400
and I'm afraid to let you down.

427
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,640
Eventually we all get tired of

428
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,080
this social way in exhaustion.

429
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,600
At this time, you will find that

430
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,320
public image

431
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,800
is not just a label.

432
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
Its purpose is to

433
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
let us imagine

434
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
what kind of person you are

435
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,960
through the label.

436
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,040
But are you really such a person?

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,120
Each of us

438
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,760
is aware of the gap in it.

439
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,760
So

440
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,760
public image

441
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,200
won't make me know you

442
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,160
but

443
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,200
only let me have prejudice against you.

444
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,400
And experience tells us

445
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,560
how hard it is

446
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,720
to reverse a prejudice.

447
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,160
So now I want to ask you

448
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,960
whether setting public image improves

449
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,440
or decreases

450
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,800
our social efficiency.

451
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,520
The first negative speaker directly refuted

452
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,360
the last point of the Team AFF,

453
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,640
and drew the audience over their side.

454
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
A direct refutation

455
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,360
can be powerful

456
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,240
when the Team AFF has just finished.

457
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,400
That's right.

458
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,200
The rhythm of the debate lies in

459
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,840
the guidance of the audience's thinking.

460
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
But the second half of her argument

461
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,400
is common.

462
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,640
Especially compared with

463
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,880
the preceding spot,

464
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,000
there are some contradictions.

465
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,880
The Team AFF still has its advantage

466
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,840
in the argument.

467
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
So they took advantages to attack

468
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,160
and cut the battlefield.

469
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,160
Since the Team AFF suggested that

470
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,200
there were many drawbacks of the image

471
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,960
imposed by others.

472
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,200
So the first round of debate

473
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,080
focused on

474
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,560
whether the public image should be projected by ourselves.

475
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,960
My fellow debater,

476
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,760
you took an example

477
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,040
that a star's agency team

478
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,400
projected him as a foodie,

479
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,720
and ended up with stomach perforation.

480
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Is the image projected by others

481
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,960
also a public image?

482
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,280
The first speaker.

483
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,040
Yes.

484
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,000
So when I was a child,

485
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,680
my mom always pulled me out

486
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,280
to perform,

487
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,040
giving me an image

488
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,920
as a genius child.

489
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,600
Is it

490
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,320
my public image?

491
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,680
The second speaker.

492
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,520
Yes, it is.

493
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,600
And I can see that

494
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,240
this has caused a lot of trouble

495
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
for you.

496
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,040
Isn't it

497
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,720
the disadvantage of setting public image?

498
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,040
It is the drawback

499
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,800
caused by the improper way of education.

500
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,080
Well, according to your side,

501
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,680
is it that

502
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,760
the label others give me

503
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,600
is my public image?

504
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:25,920
The fourth speaker.

505
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
It is right in many times.

506
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,920
For example, the label your parents gave you.

507
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,840
The third affirmative speaker is experienced.

508
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,480
He first felt the basic condition of each person,

509
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,200
and then break down one by one.

510
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,080
Not bad.

511
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,520
When I was at school,

512
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,720
my classmates always had a nickname for me

513
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
and called me a cheapskate secretly.

514
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,520
Is the cheapskate my public image?

515
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:40,840
The second speaker.

516
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,760
That's called gossip.

517
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,640
What's the difference?

518
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,320
Gossip is

519
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
other people's prejudice against you,

520
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,280
not what you say.

521
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm careless.

522
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
After a round,

523
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,440
the answer of Nan Bei

524
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
contradicted

525
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,600
Tao Hao's argument.

526
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,560
But the star's public image

527
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,240
is not projected by themselves.

528
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,400
Why can the agency team

529
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,560
set a public image for others?

530
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,960
The first debater.

531
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,120
Because the agency team

532
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,240
represents the star

533
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
when managing the public image.

534
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
So the star

535
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,760
empowered his agent to represent him.

536
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,760
As a result, the star suffered

537
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,440
for the public image.

538
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,440
The image that you choose,

539
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,320
even with tears, should be insisted on.

540
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,240
What's wrong with this?

541
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,000
Is that a disadvantage?

542
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,360
The second speaker.

543
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,720
Is the decision we make by ourselves

544
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,680
always the right one?

545
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,400
When I was a kid, I wanted to

546
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,320
practice the sunflower bible from a gentleman to a lady.

547
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
It was only when I grew up

548
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,800
that I realized

549
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
what the Invincible Asia had lost.

550
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,400
All right.

551
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
At least we have reached

552
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,840
a consensus,

553
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,600
that is, people must set their own image

554
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,440
and it is an autonomous and spontaneous behavior.

555
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,840
Right?

556
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,160
The fourth speaker.

557
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
Autonomy is not necessarily spontaneous.

558
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Anyway, others can't

559
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,840
really force us.

560
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,840
Therefore, the second point of your argument

561
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,640
that the involuntary image

562
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,760
will cause great disadvantages

563
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,400
cannot be established.

564
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,560
We screw up.

565
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
It's okay. This point has to be given away sooner or later.

566
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,120
Let's work on image management later.

567
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,400
It is easier.

568
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,840
No.

569
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,240
Aren't they trying to define it?

570
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,600
I beat them to death.

571
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,600
Thank you, chief judge.

572
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,960
My fellow debater,

573
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,240
you said that public image

574
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,480
is a perfect model of a person,

575
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,160
and also a goal

576
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,120
that one strives for.

577
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,480
Right?

578
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:10,960
The first speaker.

579
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,800
Yes.

580
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Is it true that all public image

581
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,400
is a goal?

582
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,200
The fourth speaker.

583
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,400
Yes.

584
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,560
This is the typical case

585
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,440
of making trouble out of nothing.

586
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,080
But she asked the fourth speaker.

587
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,640
The fourth speaker are generally

588
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,720
very familiar with the theoretical framework.

589
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,760
Is this a mistake?

590
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,240
No.

591
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
This is the answer she wants.

592
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,760
To complete her later reduction to absurdity.

593
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,120
A journalist, in order to obtain the trust of

594
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,160
the underground casino through unannounced investigations,

595
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,040
sets himself as

596
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,240
a person who loves gambling and money.

597
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,160
Is the lust for gambling and money

598
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,920
his goal?

599
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,280
The second debater.

600
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:39,960
No.

601
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,680
His goal is

602
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,640
to gain trust.

603
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,080
And setting public image help him

604
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,200
accomplish this goal well.

605
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,960
That's right.

606
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,840
But your argument

607
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,560
tells us

608
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
that public image is a goal in itself.

609
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,760
Why does it become

610
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,560
a means

611
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,480
to achieve the goal?

612
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,880
The second speaker.

613
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,200
It's wrong, my fellow debater.

614
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,880
In your context,

615
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,720
his so-called public image

616
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,200
is not what he really wants.

617
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,080
It's just a disguise,

618
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
instead of setting public image.

619
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,280
So the impure goal

620
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,200
is not public image

621
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,920
but disguise.

622
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,120
So all the public images

623
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,840
are all goals.

624
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,000
My fellow debater,

625
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,440
do you think

626
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,120
it is a circular argument?

627
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,600
The first speaker.

628
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,200
But what we want to emphasize is that

629
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,560
some public images themselves

630
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,720
are inconsistent with ourselves.

631
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,760
I don't like sports,

632
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
but pretend to exercise every day.

633
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm a layman

634
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,320
but share museum photos every day.

635
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,560
These are just to

636
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,680
satisfy my false vanity.

637
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
We think these are called disguise

638
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,080
not public image.

639
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,040
If all the public images

640
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,600
are true,

641
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,120
why would

642
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,280
public image be ruined?

643
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,600
The second speaker.

644
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,320
Because...

645
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,640
Because people will change.

646
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,400
So we can't deny the behavior

647
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,080
of those who are around us

648
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,840
every day

649
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,800
for vanity

650
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,520
or other purposes

651
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
to set public image.

652
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The image that does not match ourselves

653
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
also called public image.

654
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,480
Right?

655
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,160
The fourth speaker.

656
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,320
No, because...

657
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,240
Great.

658
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,280
Here,

659
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,280
Team NEG is catching up with the Team AFF.

660
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,760
In rebuttal,

661
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,080
the debate would be more in-depth.

662
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,200
The ruin of public image

663
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,360
must mean the image doesn't match me?

664
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
Is it possible that I have changed?

665
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,440
But the ruin of public image will bring people

666
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,640
great pain and stress.

667
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,360
Do you deny this?

668
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,320
I don't deny it.

669
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
But is this a drawback of public image?

670
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,920
Isn't this the drawback

671
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,720
of losing public image?

672
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,800
Is the disadvantage of losing public image

673
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,880
the drawback of public image?

674
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,360
Of course not.

675
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
The disadvantage of losing one's life

676
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
is the drawback of life?

677
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,360
Isn't the pain of a drug addict

678
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,440
losing drugs

679
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,600
the downside of drugs?

680
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,400
My fellow debater,

681
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,520
that's a bad analogy.

682
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,720
Setting public image is neutral.

683
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,240
It's just a way

684
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,680
of image management.

685
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,480
So, my fellow debater,

686
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,240
do you think that

687
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,480
the process of maintaining public image

688
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,880
is a kind of consumption to oneself?

689
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,400
That's right.

690
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
I project myself as a tourist talent

691
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,760
in my Moments.

692
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,240
I also like to travel in my daily life,

693
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,000
take some photos,

694
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
and share them in my Moments.

695
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm very happy.

696
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,320
Where is the consumption for me?

697
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Do you need

698
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,120
extra energy

699
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,240
to manage this public image?

700
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,120
No.

701
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,280
Because this is who I am.

702
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,040
You just said

703
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,200
projecting public image is a kind of image management.

704
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Now it doesn't need management.

705
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,040
Don't you want your image?

706
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,040
We emphasize that

707
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,760
setting public image is

708
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
a way of image management.

709
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
It's like when you're going to an interview,

710
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,320
don't you have to dress properly

711
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,200
and prepare carefully?

712
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,080
Isn't this

713
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,720
who you are?

714
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,360
I'm not questioning image management.

715
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,800
What I question is that you confuse the concept

716
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,840
of public image and image management.

717
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,200
What is image management?

718
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,320
Image management is about

719
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,360
presenting a better version of ourselves.

720
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,720
The point is ourselves.

721
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,560
Instead of those who

722
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,600
looks good on Moments and Weibo

723
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,200
but looks floppy

724
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,800
in life.

725
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,880
Are they presenting themselves?

726
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,920
They just

727
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,560
want friends in their Moments

728
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,320
to monitor them

729
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,680
and to become a better version of themselves.

730
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,120
Wrong.

731
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,920
They're just trying to

732
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,000
attract more attention.

733
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,000
Likes in the Moments,

734
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,840
the comparison between girlfriends,

735
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,560
or the cater to

736
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,200
to join a certain circle

737
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
are essentially the same thing,

738
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,320
that is, to attract more attention.

739
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,280
Even if they are to attract attention,

740
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,680
what's wrong with that,

741
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,240
my fellow debater?

742
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
Team AFF retreats again

743
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,440
in the essence of the resolution.

744
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,680
I'm afraid they're going to lose this round.

745
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,920
They have lost it.

746
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
One should not live with others attention and feedback.

747
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,680
and should not

748
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
live to please others.

749
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,920
Is attracting attention

750
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,480
about living for others?

751
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,520
Do you know

752
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,080
who wants to attract people's attention most

753
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,680
in the world?

754
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,880
Internet celebrities and stars.

755
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,720
But they are very happy

756
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,080
to post Weibo every day.

757
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,640
But they...

758
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,680
The rhetoric is too intense.

759
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,320
I can hardly breathe.

760
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,920
Who will make the summary?

761
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll do it.

762
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,280
I will make the summary later.

763
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Let's welcome any debater in the Team NEG

764
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,000
to make a summary

765
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,160
in two minutes.

766
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,720
Please.

767
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,520
Let Hao make the summary.

768
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,560
Hello, everyone.

769
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,440
My fellow debater just admitted that

770
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,160
the purpose of projecting public image

771
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,000
is to attract attention.

772
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,240
And they said it's good.

773
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
Stars set public image to get attention

774
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,920
and become more popular.

775
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,400
Ordinary people set public image to get attention

776
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,440
and make themselves more visible.

777
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,960
My fellow debater asked us

778
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,800
what are the disadvantages?

779
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,600
We acknowledge that

780
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,800
setting public image can help us

781
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,480
get these.

782
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,640
But what is there in this world

783
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,440
that is

784
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,000
completely without gain?

785
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,040
So please remember that

786
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,520
when we look at

787
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,480
the advantages and disadvantages of one thing,

788
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,840
don't just look at what you get,

789
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,000
but also think deeply

790
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
the cost of it.

791
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,200
At this time, I wonder

792
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,840
why the trend of setting public image

793
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
sweeps the society.

794
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,040
Maybe

795
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,920
it's because the shortcut to attract attention

796
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,560
is too tempting.

797
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,920
Just like when I was a child,

798
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,880
I am called a sensible child.

799
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
As long as I studied hard and did housework frequently,

800
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,200
as long as I was never naughty not coquetry,

801
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,400
and took care of my sister,

802
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,120
I can get everyone's recognition.

803
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,680
So I should be more sensible

804
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,400
to

805
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,760
make everyone around me

806
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,400
to be happy.

807
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,840
And maybe

808
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,960
they would love me more.

809
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,880
Gradually I got used to

810
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,280
bringing the public image

811
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,760
into my whole life.

812
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,560
People think I'm a nice and warm-hearted person.

813
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,760
So I naturally thought

814
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,840
that people really like

815
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,600
this kind of me, right?

816
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,280
So what does it matter

817
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,720
if I give myself up?

818
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,000
Every time I wronged myself

819
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,520
to make people around me happy.

820
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,560
Isn't that good?

821
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,960
So I worked harder

822
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
to get close to my public image.

823
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,840
I paid infinite care to others.

824
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,640
I pleased them,

825
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,240
threw away

826
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
all my temper and dignity.

827
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,640
Do you notice that

828
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,920
the most terrible thing

829
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,480
of setting public image

830
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,840
is that your image will in turn affect

831
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,040
and shape your life.

832
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,920
Your public image

833
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
will make you lose yourself

834
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,080
between standing and collapsing,

835
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
thus making you forget

836
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,400
who you really are.

837
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,640
I don't think that's a good thing.

838
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,440
Thank you.

839
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,720
This part really attracts my attention.

840
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,680
It's really emotional.

841
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
And she emphasized

842
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,240
the most important argument of Team NEG

843
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,200
that public image will in turn affect ourselves.

844
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,960
But it would confuse the adjudicators.

845
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,800
The point that

846
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,600
public image will in turn affect our personality

847
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,200
is equivalent to

848
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,400
be suddenly thrown out in the middle of the competition.

849
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,400
I think

850
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,560
Team NEG has begun to lose

851
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,920
the advantage

852
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,720
they won so hard.

853
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,520
But is the debate there

854
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,880
to convince the adjudicators

855
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,960
or the audience?

856
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,600
I'm a pragmatist.

857
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,160
It's the adjudicators who grade me.

858
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,240
Generally speaking, free debate is that

859
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Team AFF says public image is good

860
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,240
and Team AFF says public image is bad.

861
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Battlefield begins with

862
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,360
our familiar gossip.

863
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,040
Last month,

864
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,480
The shocking news occupied headlines.

865
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,840
I wonder if my fellow debater noticed that.

866
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,400
The public image of loving celebrity couple

867
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
was ruined overnight.

868
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,920
They were both revealed

869
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,120
to have cheated on each other.

870
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,000
Does their public image

871
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
do more harm than good?

872
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,120
My fellow debater,

873
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,240
You can't just watch the bad effect

874
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,280
without seeing the good effect.

875
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,560
They relied on the public image of loving couple

876
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,680
to participate in many shows,

877
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
receive a lot of endorsements

878
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,480
and earn plenty of money.

879
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Aren't these advantages enough?

880
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,880
It turns out that the advantages you refer to

881
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,600
is money.

882
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,880
The ruin of their public image

883
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,200
caused adverse social impact.

884
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,320
Why don't you talk about it?

885
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,960
So from a social point of view,

886
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,880
does project public image

887
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,480
actually

888
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,560
improve our social efficiency

889
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
in some way?

890
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,200
Improving efficiency is a false proposition.

891
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,080
We have already refuted it.

892
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,880
Is it the pursuit of vanity

893
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,400
to beautify a picture

894
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,360
and share it on our Moments

895
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
to get 100 likes?

896
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,160
Vanity is common to all.

897
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,120
I want to ask

898
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,240
whether a clear public image

899
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,680
can help others quickly

900
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,880
establish a

901
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,680
basic cognition of myself.

902
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,040
But this cognition

903
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,080
is vague and one-sided,

904
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,440
isn't it?

905
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,560
All cognition

906
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,040
is from vague to clear,

907
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,360
from one-sided to comprehensive.

908
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,320
Isn't the information on the business card

909
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,520
also a one-sided introduction?

910
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,240
Then may I ask you

911
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,960
whether the business card improves

912
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
or reduces social efficiency?

913
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,680
Improve.

914
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,200
But it

915
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,320
only works on shallow social contact,

916
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,880
and it will hinder deep social contact.

917
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,600
Very good.

918
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,520
We have reached a consensus.

919
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,120
There are different degrees of social contact.

920
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,480
So at the shallow social level,

921
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,320
setting public image

922
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,600
helps to improve social efficiency.

923
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,000
Right?

924
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,520
Team AFF indeed has strong strength.

925
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,280
At the beginning,

926
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,600
they resized

927
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,720
the argument of social efficiency

928
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,880
by three logical leaps.

929
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,600
More importantly,

930
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,960
They upset the rhythm of Team NEG.

931
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,960
Then they keep cutting the battlefield

932
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,040
in favor of their side.

933
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,200
At this time,

934
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,720
What should we do?

935
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,240
Recognize the point,

936
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,600
grasp the core argument,

937
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,680
and wait for an opportunity to fight back.

938
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
We have to admit that

939
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,280
public image has good effect

940
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,000
in some times.

941
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
But if we have set a public image,

942
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,360
in order to protect it,

943
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,080
we will be bound by it.

944
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,440
Are we in bondage

945
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,520
as long as

946
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,440
we care about how others see us?

947
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,160
Then we should not

948
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,560
leave any impression on others,

949
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,880
and do not have any social networks

950
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,680
and Moments.

951
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,520
How is such a requirement

952
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,320
not a form of bondage?

953
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:51,760
Today, I set myself

954
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
as a computer talent.

955
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,400
Will many friends

956
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,200
come to me to repair the computers?

957
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,720
Is this a kind of

958
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
consumption and burden?

959
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,240
My fellow debater,

960
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,920
I think you can

961
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,360
set yourself as

962
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,680
someone who doesn't like to be bothered.

963
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,520
Your trouble will be solved.

964
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,680
Well said, my fellow debater.

965
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,840
For the sake of one public image,

966
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,160
I need to set another one.

967
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,480
Eventually numerous images erode

968
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,760
the truest self.

969
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,640
One public image

970
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,200
need countless images to cover up.

971
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,800
Isn't it like a lie?

972
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,320
Do lies

973
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
do more good than harm?

974
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,240
Team NEG won a little advantage.

975
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,960
But the advantage of Team AFF

976
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,720
is still not reversed.

977
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,280
Does my fellow debaters agree that

978
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,120
the public image is based on

979
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,960
people's stereotypes?

980
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,600
We believe that

981
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,800
the understanding of my fellow debater

982
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,240
is the stereotype of public image.

983
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,880
Is public image

984
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
a kind of label?

985
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,600
Setting public image

986
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,840
is a kind of labeled behavior.

987
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,440
But is label

988
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,600
necessarily bad?

989
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,640
In fact, setting public image existed since ancient times.

990
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,800
Cao Cao was evaluated by YueDanPing

991
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,760
as a capable minister at peaceful time

992
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,520
and a cunning chief at a war time.

993
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
Liu Bei spent his whole life

994
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,680
to keep his public image

995
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,360
as a righteous person.

996
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,840
All these have promoted the

997
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,520
their hegemony.

998
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,680
What are the drawbacks?

999
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,680
Putting ancient stories

1000
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560
in today's view

1001
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,560
seems lofty.

1002
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,040
But please think about it carefully.

1003
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,360
Are you willing to follow

1004
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,000
a true leader

1005
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,120
or a public image?

1006
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,320
The essence of public image

1007
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,520
is not a natural person.

1008
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,000
My fellow debater,

1009
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,840
how can we follow it?

1010
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,920
May I ask my fellow debater

1011
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,040
what the essence of

1012
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
public image is?

1013
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,200
We believe that

1014
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,040
setting public image

1015
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,240
is an autonomous and selective process

1016
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,680
to present ourselves.

1017
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,960
In today's time,

1018
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,760
that's not wrong.

1019
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,680
On the contrary,

1020
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,640
this is exactly a way

1021
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,800
that will allow us

1022
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
to live better with the world.

1023
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,720
All arguments in the free debate

1024
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,520
are fifty-fifty.

1025
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,840
But...

1026
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,840
At this time,

1027
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,680
the closing argument

1028
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,600
becomes the key point of winning.

1029
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,080
In the past, closing arguments on this type of resolution

1030
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,360
are usually about value.

1031
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,480
But the audience have just accepted

1032
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,560
a lot of confusing information.

1033
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,000
Under such condition,

1034
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,640
blindly talking about value

1035
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,360
will only make

1036
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,600
audience is more confused.

1037
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
Closing argument.

1038
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,800
In the original closing argument,

1039
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,560
value sublimation accounts for half.

1040
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,480
This won't work.

1041
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,280
If I were here,

1042
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,200
I would return to the definition

1043
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,840
and lead the audience to

1044
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,440
sort out the logic of the whole competition.

1045
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,520
This is the

1046
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
the final part of the competition.

1047
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,920
Closing arguments.

1048
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,280
Four minutes for each side.

1049
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,400
Let's first welcome

1050
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,520
the fourth debater from Team NEG.

1051
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,560
Thank you, chief judge.

1052
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,400
Hello, everyone.

1053
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,200
Team AFF said that setting public image

1054
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,600
is to present ourselves better.

1055
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,520
I don't think it's right.

1056
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Some people will set themselves

1057
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,200
as people who are naturally cool and thin.

1058
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,640
Some people will project themselves

1059
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,600
as people who have allodoxaphobia

1060
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,080
or who are depressed.

1061
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,360
But all these public images

1062
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,160
don't match what the Team AFF said

1063
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,880
about presenting themselves

1064
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,440
or improving social efficiency.

1065
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,960
They have only one thing in common,

1066
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,600
that is,

1067
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
attracting attention.

1068
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,120
We believe that

1069
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,680
the essence of setting public image

1070
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,080
is a kind of communication behavior.

1071
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,000
It seems that more people today

1072
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,920
want to be seen,

1073
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,040
and want to be noticed.

1074
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,920
So we will have all kinds of

1075
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,760
public image.

1076
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,240
For example, happy or sad one,

1077
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,720
friendly or unkind one.

1078
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,320
All of these

1079
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
are guiding us

1080
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,320
to attach one label after another

1081
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,280
to ourselves.

1082
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,560
We hope to fit in the circle,

1083
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
hope to gain recognition,

1084
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,560
hope to receive praise and jealousy.

1085
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,080
But as information

1086
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,800
increasingly explodes,

1087
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,680
people's attention

1088
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,000
seems to get more and more distracted.

1089
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,560
How can I

1090
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,200
get more attention?

1091
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Communication tells us

1092
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,360
the simpler, the more efficient.

1093
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,080
So our public image

1094
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,600
is getting simpler,

1095
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,440
from loving life at the beginning

1096
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,120
to loving food.

1097
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,800
In the end, it becomes one word,

1098
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,720
foodie.

1099
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,600
Do you remember

1100
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,840
what our first debater said?

1101
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,240
Your public image

1102
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,560
will also in turn shape

1103
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,840
and affect your life.

1104
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,080
So your life and goals

1105
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
also begin to become so simple and extreme

1106
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,280
that we all forget

1107
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,480
why we set the public image

1108
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,520
at the beginning.

1109
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,000
Instead, we just care about

1110
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,120
how much attention we get.

1111
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,840
Public image is in essence

1112
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,000
a tool for screenwriters.

1113
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,280
Its principle is that

1114
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,680
a few simple words

1115
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,080
can be used to

1116
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,200
describe a

1117
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,800
complete character.

1118
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,840
But when we spit out

1119
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,360
the thin and rigid characters

1120
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,680
in movies and TV shows,

1121
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,560
when we talk about

1122
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,000
the gossip that

1123
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
stars are ruined by fans and public images,

1124
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
whether

1125
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,680
do we also become shallow

1126
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,640
because of the ruin of public images?

1127
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
I hope our debate

1128
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,000
will be a wake-up call and reflection

1129
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,040
for all of you.

1130
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:00,680
Thank you.

1131
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,240
After the deliberation of adjudicators,

1132
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
the result of this competition

1133
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,480
is in my hands.

1134
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,960
The best debater in this competition

1135
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,200
is the third debater from Team NEG.

1136
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,520
The winner of this competition is

1137
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,080
Team NEG,

1138
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,840
Dongzhou University of Finance and Economics Debate Team

1139
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,040
Congratulations.

1140
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,840
OK. That's all for today.

1141
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,040
Study it carefully.

1142
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,680
Train on time tomorrow.

1143
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,960
Did you win?

1144
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,320
Well, congratulations.

1145
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,320
Thank you.

1146
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,520
Let's make peace.

1147
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,320
Let's break up.

1148
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,480
Thank you for taking care of me

1149
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,400
over the past two years.

1150
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:04,960
I wish you happiness.

1151
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,080
We can break up.

1152
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,560
But we should

1153
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,080
talk about it clearly.

1154
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,560
I have tried hard

1155
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,760
for the relationship.

1156
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,840
Even if I knew that

1157
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,480
there was serious problem

1158
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,360
between us,

1159
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,640
I'm still trying to fix it.

1160
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,760
Now we break up.

1161
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,240
Don't you think it has a lot to do

1162
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,120
with your personality?

1163
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes.

1164
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
There is something wrong with my personality.

1165
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
But I'm not

1166
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,080
entirely responsible

1167
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
for our breakup.

1168
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
As my boyfriend,

1169
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,480
you were supposed to

1170
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,360
accept all of me.

1171
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,760
But you didn't.

1172
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,560
You always

1173
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,840
ran away my weakness.

1174
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,480
You only accepted

1175
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,120
the part you could accept.

1176
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,920
But it doesn't matter.

1177
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,520
I believe

1178
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,320
there will be someone who can do it.

1179
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,760
When things go wrong

1180
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,840
in a relationship,

1181
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,040
you shouldn't

1182
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,240
blames others first.

1183
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,400
Think about your own problems.

1184
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,720
I hope you can

1185
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,640
be more mature in the future.

1186
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,480
I asked you out today

1187
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,120
to explain

1188
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,160
why

1189
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,640
I ran away from the debate classroom that day.

1190
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,800
I know that's very impolite.

1191
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,440
So

1192
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,680
I want to

1193
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
tell you my story.

1194
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,200
In fact,

1195
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
when I was in junior high school,

1196
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,640
I put on a lot of weight

1197
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,720
because I was addicted to sweets.

1198
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,680
I became the laughing stock of the whole class.

1199
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,000
Round ball

1200
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm sorry.

1201
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,960
There's no way I'm in relationship with you.

1202
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,440
At that time,

1203
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,480
they gave me a nickname,

1204
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,680
round ball.

1205
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,160
It was the darkest time

1206
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,120
of my life.

1207
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,280
After that,

1208
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,320
I don't even have the courage

1209
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,400
to eat sweets again.

1210
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,080
Until that day

1211
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,440
I ate the cookies you made for me.

1212
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,000
So

1213
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,640
I didn't run that day

1214
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,920
because I hate you

1215
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
or other reasons.

1216
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,920
It's because your dessert

1217
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,920
is so delicious.

1218
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,800
Okay.

1219
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,720
Is it?

1220
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,840
Yes.

1221
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Well, senior.

1222
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,240
I'll make you some

1223
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,560
low-sugar and low-calorie cookies later.

1224
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,440
This provincial league

1225
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,200
will adopt a free point system.

1226
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,840
All teams that

1227
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,120
score 50 points by March 21

1228
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,200
will qualify for

1229
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,280
the final.

1230
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,880
Teams

1231
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,560
that register as

1232
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,720
university team

1233
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,120
will have five basic points.

1234
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,840
And the social team formed by individuals

1235
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,040
don't have the basic points.

1236
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,480
After the free points competition,

1237
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,880
the Provincial Competition Committee

1238
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,680
will make the final system

1239
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,480
of the next stage

1240
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,400
according to the number of teams

1241
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,880
entering the finals.

1242
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,720
The competition champion will

1243
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,280
be known a week later.

1244
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,240
See you in the final.

1245
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,680
With the way

1246
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,880
we're winning points,

1247
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,760
there's no problem

1248
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,520
accumulating enough points in short time.

1249
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,040
Hao

1250
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,360
How many points does our team have now?

1251
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,000
Since we

1252
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,040
signed up

1253
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,800
as the social team,

1254
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,320
all the points of the team two

1255
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,720
are cleared.

1256
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,560
So now the point is

1257
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,440
zero.

1258
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,240
What about the zero?

1259
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,920
With our strength,

1260
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,320
we can get enough points quickly.

1261
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,360
Do you forget the days

1262
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,680
when we were beaten by team one?

1263
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,080
Don't you

1264
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,560
want revenge on Liu Yanze?

1265
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,880
This is our momentum.

1266
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,840
Yeah.

1267
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,920
What about the zero?

1268
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,320
What about the zero?

1269
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,680
Look at the strength

1270
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,880
of the members in our team.

1271
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,320
We.

1272
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,600
Our team.

1273
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,840
What's the name?

1274
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,200
Right.

1275
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,280
We need a team name.

1276
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,240
It is best to be able to

1277
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,760
reflect our mental journey.

1278
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,120
That's right.

1279
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,520
Hmm.

1280
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,280
After all the humiliations we've endured,

1281
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,320
there's nothing we want more than to turn around.

1282
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,800
That's right.

1283
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,840
Okay.

1284
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,640
Our name is

1285
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,840
Turnaround Team.

1286
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,320
Right.

1287
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,120
That sounds kind of depressing.

1288
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Naming

1289
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,920
is very important.

1290
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,160
It's better to

1291
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,480
be catchy

1292
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,240
after we're popular.

1293
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,320
It's better to highlight our

1294
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,680
vigorous youth,

1295
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,600
hard work,

1296
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,960
strong strength

1297
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,040
and determination

1298
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,880
to become popular in cities and villages.

1299
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,960
Okay.

1300
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,440
Then our name is Cities and Villages Team.

1301
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,640
It's not good.

1302
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,680
Justice League Team.

1303
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,640
That has the copyright.

1304
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,320
I'm the Champion Team.

1305
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,240
Superficial.

1306
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,360
I'm the Veteran Team.

1307
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,160
This won't pass the review.

1308
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,080
It's too troublesome to think of a name. Oh, my God.

1309
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,520
Let's play cards for a while.

1310
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,120
Ten.

1311
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,000
K.

1312
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:58,920
Two.

1313
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,640
Take it back.

1314
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,600
Above k are jokers.

1315
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,840
Two is the smallest one.

1316
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,440
Who taught you the rules?

1317
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,760
Two, three, five are the biggest cards.

1318
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,880
JQK comes after that.

1319
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,720
Don't play tricks.

1320
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,240
Two, three, five are the smallest.

1321
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah.

1322
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,600
No.

1323
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,360
In my hometown,

1324
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
two, three, five are really the biggest cards.

1325
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,840
I don't care.

1326
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,120
I only have one card left.

1327
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,440
Our name may be

1328
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,200
Team 235.

1329
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,000
What do you mean?

1330
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,560
It's too casual.

1331
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,440
What do you mean?

1332
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,520
235 means that you're sophomores,

1333
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,560
I'm a junior,

1334
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,400
and you are the senior?

1335
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,360
No personal attacks, OK?

1336
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,000
No.

1337
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Take playing cards as an example.

1338
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,720
In some places,

1339
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,160
two, three, five are the smallest cards.

1340
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,440
But there are places

1341
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
where two, three, five are the biggest cards

1342
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,360
and can defeat JQK.

1343
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,680
Just like our team.

1344
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,560
That's interesting.

1345
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,400
Okay.

1346
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Defeat team one.

1347
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,000
It's time to show

1348
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,880
our real strength.

1349
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:54,960
Good.

1350
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
Hurry up to study the competition system.

1351
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,720
Let's see

1352
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,480
what other games we can play next.

1353
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,880
OK?

1354
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,040
I and Sa

1355
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,000
had studied the competition system.

1356
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,720
We've signed up

1357
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,760
for every competition we can.

1358
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,440
So as long as

1359
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,680
we play all our games on time and on schedule,

1360
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,320
we should have no problem in qualifying.

1361
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,640
I've made a list of the competitions.

1362
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,800
Let's have a look together.

1363
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,360
Sorry, it's closing time.

1364
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,320
Oh,

1365
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,920
sorry, sorry.

1366
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,480
Dango

1367
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,560
Do you think

1368
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,040
there's anything going on

1369
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,120
with those two?

1370
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,120
From the horse's mouth.

1371
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,120
Their relationship is simpler than that of you and Ma Nan.

1372
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,720
But you're right.

1373
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,400
They've gotten to this point in their relationship.

1374
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,080
What are they waiting for?

1375
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,480
Do you think

1376
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,760
they don't want to make progress,

1377
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,920
or they haven't made progress yet?

1378
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,040
Nan Bei said that

1379
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
his mother had absolute sovereignty

1380
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,440
since he was a child.

1381
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,680
He and his father are both afraid of his mother.

1382
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,760
So Nan Bei wants to find

1383
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,960
a gentle woman like water.

1384
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
Do you think Xiaoyu is like that kind of girl?

1385
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,960
Not necessarily.

1386
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,920
Doesn't Nan Bei

1387
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,960
always contradict himself?

1388
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,200
Right.

1389
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,160
Maybe he's used to

1390
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,640
such a way of getting along

1391
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,360
and feel it is the most comfortable and convenient way

1392
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,680
to get along with others.

1393
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,600
Yo yo.

1394
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,880
Rise to the theoretical level.

1395
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,760
I'm thirty years old.

1396
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,680
I don't see any of you

1397
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,360
bothering about me.

1398
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,880
Go back to sleep tonight.

1399
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,440
Begin to fight tomorrow morning.

1400
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,160
All right.

1401
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,840
Okay.

1402
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,280
The original team two of our school

1403
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,000
has officially left the school team.

1404
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,320
As a social team,

1405
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
they signed up for

1406
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,160
preliminary stage of provincial league.

1407
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,400
In the next three days,

1408
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,680
they will fight against the tigers in the development zone,

1409
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,200
Huarong Vocational College,

1410
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,040
Xinxing Hotel Management College

1411
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,760
Huang Zhizhong from Yau Ma Tei.

1412
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,640
and

1413
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,600
Linhai University of Chemical Technology

1414
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,360
with the title of "a gun in a village".

1415
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,440
Today

1416
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,320
they will fight against

1417
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,760
Ruihong Vocational and Technical College

1418
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,200
with the title of

1419
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,040
Ma Weiwei in Shanzhai Zhenhong Street.

1420
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,520
Let's wait and see.

1421
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,880
Pain is a kind of consciousness.

1422
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,920
If you can't sleep, you are awake.

1423
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,520
So you are conscious.

1424
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,160
You're asleep

1425
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,560
and can't get up, so you don't even have consciousness.

1426
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,520
You know nothing about pain.

1427
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,720
How can this be more painful than sleeplessness?

1428
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,000
According to your statement,

1429
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,280
you can't get up, so you're unconscious.

1430
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,480
You are forced to get up and have consciousness,

1431
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,280
which is a forcible strike.

1432
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,080
The comparison shows that

1433
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,160
it is more painful not to get up.

1434
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,240
My fellow debater,

1435
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,320
today we discuss

1436
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,800
whether niche hobbies should become widely known.

1437
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,440
Does it mean that

1438
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,560
the development of niche hobbies

1439
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,440
is limited?

1440
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,400
When it comes to limitation,

1441
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,720
it refers that my fellow debater

1442
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,480
force them to be widely known.

1443
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,200
Forced love does not last.

1444
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,120
My fellow debater

1445
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,280
Becoming a household name will be more beneficial

1446
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,320
to the development of niche culture.

1447
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,680
Is that right?

1448
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,440
I would like to hear the details.

1449
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,880
If an activity become widely known,

1450
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,760
it will have more audience,

1451
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,840
more practitioners,

1452
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,880
more sponsors and so on.

1453
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,120
So these more resources

1454
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,080
can promote better development.

1455
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,400
Right?

1456
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,080
Not necessarily.

1457
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,840
What hobby do you have

1458
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,720
that doesn't work that way?

1459
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,600
My hobby

1460
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,160
is to be a niche enthusiast.

1461
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,760
If it is widely known, I need a new one.

1462
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,800
For the group of niche enthusiasts

1463
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,840
like me,

1464
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,840
the ideal situation

1465
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,400
is to entertain ourselves in niches.

1466
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,760
The help of my dad

1467
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,480
reduced my struggle of twenty years.

1468
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,520
Did my dad's help

1469
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,280
get in the way

1470
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:04,880
of my struggle?

1471
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,120
Quite reverse.

1472
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
Your dad helped you

1473
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,160
to a higher platform,

1474
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:08,880
thus helping you

1475
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,160
struggle better.

1476
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,120
Struggle for what?

1477
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,200
Struggle to better collect rent?

1478
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,240
Okay, even if we don't mention anything else,

1479
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,040
we just focus on the face score.

1480
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,240
What if the opposite one

1481
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,800
is tofu beauty?

1482
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,000
Isn't it the same?

1483
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,560
My fellow debater

1484
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,440
Tofu beauty

1485
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,280
originated from Mrs. Yang

1486
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,240
in Lu Xun's "Hometown".

1487
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:29,840
I suggest you

1488
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,880
check the source first

1489
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,440
to prevent

1490
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,560
the stupid mistake.

1491
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,160
My fellow debater

1492
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,320
I'm afraid you just read superficial meanings.

1493
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,880
You don't criticize bystanders' humiliation

1494
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,080
but blame Mrs. Yang's beauty.

1495
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,560
My fellow debater

1496
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,080
You are

1497
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,360
sour grapes.

1498
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,000
The winner is

1499
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,440
Team 235.

1500
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,720
Shui

1501
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,320
What's the name

1502
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,080
of your lead singer?

1503
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,400
Xiaoyang

1504
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,240
There is really a band.

1505
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,600
It's been three years.

1506
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,120
I work in the bar

1507
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,600
to support this band.

1508
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,560
Wow.

1509
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,560
Why don't you sing?

1510
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,480
I'm tone-deaf.

1511
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,560
My sketch homework is due tonight.

1512
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,880
I'm gonna be a little late.

1513
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,720
You guys practice first.

1514
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,120
I also need to do my work

1515
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,280
in the student union.

1516
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,880
What are you reading?

1517
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,560
WeChat group. Phone.

1518
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,360
No hurry. We haven't

1519
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,640
find a place to train.

1520
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,760
I have a suggestion.

1521
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,400
You and Nan Bei can take seats first.

1522
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,080
We used to train there.

1523
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,680
Right here?
