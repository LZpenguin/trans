Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP13

2
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,720
I attended my high school reunion

3
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
last week.

4
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
There was a girl

5
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
carrying a luxury bag.

6
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,840
But when she was in high school,

7
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,600
she applied for an exemption

8
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,960
from the school.

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,360
We now suspect that she

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
lied about her family.

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,920
Ran Da's family must be poor.

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,200
I was in the same high school as him.

13
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,040
I know it very well.

14
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,480
His dad was laid off and his mom left early.

15
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,320
At that time,

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,880
in order to save two yuan on bus,

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,760
he rode three hours

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,960
to and from school every day.

19
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,440
Even if his application is true,

20
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
he has money

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
to buy roller skates,

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
which means that he is not in trouble enough

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,760
to need a subsidy.

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,440
What exactly is considered poor?

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,760
Do we need to hold

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,320
a tragedy competition?

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,720
In order to pay back

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,080
the 1,500 yuan that Jingwen lent me,

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,320
I can only

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,480
eat your meals this month.

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,760
Am I miserable?

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
Can I apply for it?

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,920
So the review team

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,680
is set up

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
to eliminate people like you.

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,320
Before, a senior

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,960
took time off to go back to his hometown

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
at a fixed time every year.

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,760
He said that because his parents were in poor health,

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,280
he would go home to help collect corn.

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
At first, we all thought he

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,760
was joking.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,840
We didn't know it was true

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,240
until he

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
brought several boxes of corn

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
to us every time

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,440
he came back from home.

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
I had dinner with that high school classmate

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,480
last semester.

50
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,040
She told me

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,080
that she kept every meal

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
within three yuan.

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,240
She just ordered a vegetarian dish

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,040
and a steamed twisted roll.

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,880
Later, the price increased.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,520
She only changed the steamed twisted roll into the steamed bun.

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,320
Do you understand?

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,920
This kind of student

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
will never buy

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
a luxury bag

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,760
even if she gets subsidies.

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,400
Where does

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
your friend get the bag?

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,360
I don't think

65
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,600
this is logical at all.

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,760
He has his own roller skates.

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,520
He doesn't buy roller skates

68
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
with the money.

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,680
They are completely different.

70
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,720
What if

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,120
this is what he got in the lottery?

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
What if

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,560
this is from the parents

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
after he saved a drowning child?

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
What if he picked this up in the street?

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,400
She tells me

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,120
that this bag is

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
from her boyfriend.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,960
He works two jobs.

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
He is so tired that he catches a high fever,

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,200
but he doesn't go to the hospital.

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,640
Could it be that

83
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,360
they saved money together to buy it?

84
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Because the boy loves the girl dearly,

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
he pays more.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Maybe.

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,520
If it comes from a special channel,

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,280
it seems a bit cruel

89
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,200
for us to deprive her of

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,240
this accidental luxury right.

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,920
Let's have a look tomorrow.

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,840
Give me a hand with the cards.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,520
I play cards with Dandan,

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
and my forehead is swollen.

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
The third sign of liking someone

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,520
is that you can't help

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
chatting with him

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,840
and giggle with your mobile phone.

99
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,800
Lin Dingxiang, Zhou Xiaoyu.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,560
Ran Da.

101
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,400
I don't know if Nan Bei

102
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,600
has reached an agreement with Xiaoyu.

103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't grasp

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
the essence of this matter at all.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,480
But I think

106
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,440
he can get the subsidy

107
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,840
as long as he didn't

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,240
buy the shoes himself.

109
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm not talking about this.

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,640
He also meets this standard

111
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,760
in other aspects.

112
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,400
I'm talking about Xiaoyu and Nan Bei.

113
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,920
Think about it.

114
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,480
Nan Bei usually

115
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,880
does Xiaoyu's bidding, right?

116
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,000
But why

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,840
does he go against Xiaoyu

118
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
at this critical moment?

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,320
Of course.

120
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,120
It's a fact that they have different opinions.

121
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,280
But don't you think

122
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,800
Nan Bei is a bit arrogant this time?

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,720
Yes, a bit.

124
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
That means

125
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,720
they're going to be together soon.

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,520
Really?

127
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,400
That's strange.

128
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
If so, Nan Bei should

129
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,840
be more obedient to Xiaoyu.

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
It looks like

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,560
they're discussing about Ran Da.

132
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
In reality,

133
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,040
they're arguing about the dominance of marriage.

134
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
How is that possible?

135
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,400
You think too much.

136
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
If you don't believe me, just see the result.

137
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,720
Trust me.

138
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,080
You think this matter too complicatedly.

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,760
You think this matter too simply.

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,320
I don't.

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,880
Why

142
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,440
do we argue about this?

143
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,320
Xiaoyu

144
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,840
Xiaoyu

145
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,320
Xiaoyu

146
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,240
Why are you so weird?

147
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,960
You stand there and don't move.

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,240
If you have anything to say,

149
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,880
just stand there and say it.

150
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,200
I wanna tell you

151
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
about Ran Da.

152
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,600
Dandan investigated

153
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,680
the origin of his shoes.

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,400
He said he had news.

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,080
Let's go together.

156
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,000
You...

157
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,360
Why should I go with you?

158
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,480
What?

159
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,200
Let's go.

160
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,040
Don't touch me.

161
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,920
You...

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
All right, let's go together.

163
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,600
You go ahead.

164
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,440
What's the matter?

165
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
I'll keep a distance of two meters from you.

166
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,960
You go.

167
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,080
Don't look back.

168
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,240
Right.

169
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,640
Dandan

170
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Do it again.

171
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,080
Dandan

172
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,120
You just practice by yourself.

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,600
Take your time.

174
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,720
OK.

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,320
You're weak.

176
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,120
All the contents on Ran Da's application form

177
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,360
are true, right?

178
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,560
Absolutely.

179
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,360
That's good.

180
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,240
If you continue

181
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
to vote against it as before,

182
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,320
you must first prove

183
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,360
that excessive consumption

184
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,520
must mean that the family is not poor

185
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,600
or not poor enough.

186
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
I've figured this out.

187
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,080
I can't prove it.

188
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,600
So now I just need to know

189
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
that as long as he can prove

190
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,640
that he has special channels

191
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,840
and this pair of shoes was not bought by him,

192
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,680
I believe

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,440
that he is eligible for subsidy.

194
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
He bought it himself.

195
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,960
So I still disagree.

196
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Don't jump to conclusions,

197
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,760
okay?

198
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
It's different

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,680
to buy it with one month's pocket money

200
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
and with one semester's pocket money,

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
okay?

202
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,240
He bought it after working for two months

203
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,160
in summer vacation.

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,160
Look.

205
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,600
I feel sorry for him

206
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
as much as you do.

207
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,520
I'm just against him in this matter.

208
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,400
Why?

209
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,720
Because the fact that he earns so much money

210
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,040
from his part-time job

211
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,320
proves that he doesn't really need

212
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
the grant.

213
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
There must be someone who needs it more.

214
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
I find you

215
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,080
too narrow-minded.

216
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,040
You...

217
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,680
Got in trouble, right?

218
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,360
Got in trouble, right?

219
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,560
You finish the work?

220
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,680
Yes.

221
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,960
And you?

222
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,160
I need a little more time.

223
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Do you still remember

224
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,600
that you promised me

225
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
that you would accompany me

226
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,080
wherever I wanted to go

227
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
as long as

228
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,440
I had my own time?

229
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
It seems so.

230
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,320
I see you are idle today.

231
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
So today?

232
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,960
Xiaoyu

233
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,760
Why do you

234
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
buy me a hamburger today?

235
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Because it's happy and relaxing

236
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,720
to watch you eating.

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
My dad also thinks so.

238
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,160
Dango

239
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,520
Let me ask you something.

240
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,040
OK.

241
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,040
What do you think

242
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,560
is the feeling when falling in love?

243
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,280
You are in love?

244
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,560
No.

245
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,840
I...

246
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,560
I watched TV series.

247
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,960
Then

248
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
I didn't quite understand

249
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
a plot.

250
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,760
So I decided to ask you.

251
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,120
Oh.

252
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,840
Watch TV series?

253
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,680
All right.

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
I think

255
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,120
falling in love means

256
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,560
that he shines

257
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,880
like the sun.

258
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
You feel like everything

259
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,160
is getting cute.

260
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,880
When you think about it like this,

261
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
you only have him in your eyes

262
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,520
before you know it.

263
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,640
You keep looking at him

264
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,560
as if his whole face

265
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
is very close to you.

266
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,040
His every move

267
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,160
and any small expression

268
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,760
will be firmly remembered by you.

269
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,400
Then

270
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,160
you can see him at school,

271
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,280
and you will feel

272
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,480
very happy to go to school.

273
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
You even pretend

274
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,840
to make excuses

275
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040
to see him secretly

276
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,760
where he is.

277
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
But as long as

278
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,400
you meet him face to face,

279
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
you will be very nervous.

280
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,640
You think about it

281
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,080
and don't know what to say,

282
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,560
so you leave.

283
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,720
Although you are very happy,

284
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,000
it is also very difficult.

285
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,920
You wanna meet, but you are afraid.

286
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,640
You wanna talk, but you can't.

287
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,720
Is that love?

288
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,440
Take care.

289
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,520
Thank you.

290
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,240
Please, check out.

291
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,040
Just one?

292
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,480
Yes.

293
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:35,920
Please.

294
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,200
Are you two together?

295
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,040
Yes.

296
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,640
And

297
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
we have a discount

298
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,840
on dolphin dolls.

299
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,160
If you buy two or more

300
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
and then pay an additional 30 yuan,

301
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,320
we give you two

302
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,360
free dolphin pendants.

303
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,200
Well.

304
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,080
Ah?

305
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,240
I mean

306
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
it's free anyway.

307
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,440
By the way,

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
I don't need two pendants,

309
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,440
so I'll give you one.

310
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,440
So

311
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,600
the formation of social morality

312
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,920
is

313
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,400
a normalization of standards of behavior.

314
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,720
Do you have any ideas on this?

315
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,760
If a poor student

316
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,400
uses a

317
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,560
luxury item

318
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,280
or

319
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,640
spends a lot of money,

320
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,920
should he be disqualified

321
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,400
from applying for the student grant?

322
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,920
Is this

323
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,200
a discussion about standards?

324
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,280
Yes.

325
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,760
Does anyone

326
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,360
answer her

327
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
this question?

328
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,880
I am a poor student.

329
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
I also got a subsidy last year.

330
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,320
I think

331
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,920
it is wrong to judge it

332
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,160
by whether there is excessive consumption behavior.

333
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,160
Other students

334
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,520
buy a pair of AJs every semester.

335
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
But I buy a pair

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,560
with the money I saved for four years.

337
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,200
If I am disqualified

338
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,640
because of my occasional

339
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,600
excessive consumption,

340
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
I think it is unfair

341
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,760
to poor students.

342
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,840
This is a violation

343
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
of normal rights.

344
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,680
But

345
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,080
when you enjoy certain benefits,

346
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,640
you should bear relative obligations.

347
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,680
I agree.

348
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
Because most poor students

349
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
don't have excessive consumption,

350
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,440
there is no problem

351
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,200
taking this

352
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,040
as a standard.

353
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,120
Even if you buy a pair of AJ

354
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,040
in four years,

355
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,640
there must be other poor students

356
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,080
who need the money of this pair

357
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,920
to pay for tuition

358
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,640
and subsidize their living.

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,480
The subsidy rule

360
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,840
does not deprive the recipient

361
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,800
of the right to consume freely.

362
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
When there are rules,

363
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,880
I think we should

364
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,560
respect the rules.

365
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,080
Aren't we debating

366
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,200
whether it should be included

367
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,440
in the subsidy qualification for poor students?

368
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,120
Yes.

369
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,040
But we're now...

370
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
These are not essences.

371
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm not sure.

372
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,600
But fundamentally speaking,

373
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,880
the cause of this matter

374
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,800
is that people don't like

375
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
the students who get subsidies

376
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,880
to enjoy excessive consumption.

377
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,040
They always think

378
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,880
that in this case,

379
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
you must...

380
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,400
Since you are a poor student,

381
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
you can't afford

382
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,040
anything a little more expensive.

383
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,240
That's not what I mean.

384
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,680
It doesn't matter. I understand.

385
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,680
I once

386
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,240
talked about it with my friends.

387
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,560
But it is easy to think

388
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,920
that I criticize them for discrimination.

389
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,200
I don't think

390
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,040
this is discrimination at all.

391
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,880
I can't say exactly

392
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,120
what it is.

393
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,080
That's right.

394
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,640
This is not discrimination.

395
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
But this is prejudice, right?

396
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,880
Go on.

397
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,640
Hello

398
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,280
I believe

399
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,240
that your friend

400
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
never discriminated against you.

401
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,880
But what you just said

402
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
may be a prejudice

403
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,320
that you don't

404
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,960
even realize.

405
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,840
You stubbornly believe

406
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,080
that poor students must not

407
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,840
buy something expensive.

408
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,320
People with disabilities

409
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
must be unhappy.

410
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,160
Children from divorced families

411
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,120
must be unhappy.

412
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
This prejudice

413
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,040
makes me feel as if this kind of thing

414
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,960
must be done like this.

415
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
If it's not,

416
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
it must be wrong.

417
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,160
So the essence of the matter

418
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,440
is not that the rules

419
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,080
should be changed or not,

420
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,480
but

421
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,560
that prejudice makes us

422
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,440
feel a sense of discomfort

423
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,720
when we face such matters,

424
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,360
and we don't know

425
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,680
what the cause of the problem really is,

426
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:49,960
right?

427
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,760
I think you're right.

428
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,640
Mu Xiaoyu

429
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,880
What do you think?

430
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,960
I agree with half.

431
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,760
Emotionally speaking,

432
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,600
this inherent

433
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,360
perception

434
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,280
does exist.

435
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
But rationally,

436
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,280
regardless of how people feel or

437
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,920
whether this is bias or not,

438
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,480
there is no way to address

439
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
the key point that doesn't make sense.

440
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,240
I just finally figured it out.

441
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,120
This is because the student grant

442
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,720
is a way of secondary distribution

443
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,120
from the state

444
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,240
to enable more people

445
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,840
to study without being troubled by their financial situation.

446
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,560
My view has always been

447
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
that excessive consumption means that the financial situation is okay.

448
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,920
In this case,

449
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,160
this subsidy should

450
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
be given to more people in need.

451
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,240
After all,

452
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,160
this is the original intention of the subsidy system,

453
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,320
right?

454
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,240
It's good.

455
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,760
It's wonderful.

456
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,360
I am very interested

457
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,760
in the last paragraph

458
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
of Mu Xiaoyu.

459
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,840
If the subsidy

460
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,760
is regarded as a distribution,

461
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,560
its rule is directed at individuals,

462
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,560
but its target

463
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,760
is directed at groups.

464
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,400
The contradiction is

465
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,320
whether the constraint

466
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,680
of not being able to engage in excessive consumption

467
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,600
can become

468
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,640
one of the standards for receiving subsidies.

469
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,680
The service target

470
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,520
of this standard

471
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
happens to be all college students.

472
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,800
You can think about it

473
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,280
from this angle

474
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,040
combined with the individual angle.

475
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,440
This is a policy debate.

476
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,000
You all think from a wrong angle.

477
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,840
You say to use need, root, solution, gain and loss.

478
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
Hold on.

479
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,600
Need and what?

480
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,480
Need, root, solution, gain and loss.

481
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,880
It is one of the most commonly used tools

482
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,160
in the analysis of the policy debate.

483
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,360
It is used to analyze

484
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,160
the need,

485
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,520
root, solution,

486
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,280
and gain/loss ratio in a policy.

487
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,160
This policy

488
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,400
is whether or not high spending

489
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
should be included in the subsidy rules for needy students.

490
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,360
First of all, I think

491
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,480
there is the need.

492
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,040
This is part of

493
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,600
improving the subsidy system.

494
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,520
Really?

495
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,880
Improving policies

496
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,360
has never been a rigid demand.

497
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,400
There is

498
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,320
no 100% perfect policy

499
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,480
in this world.

500
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,440
However,

501
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,880
within a relatively reasonable range,

502
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
there can be detailed and perfect needs.

503
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,080
The finer it is, the higher the entropy is.

504
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,200
The rougher it is,

505
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
the more unpredictable it is.

506
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,840
So

507
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,120
sometimes

508
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,400
we do bad things with good intentions.

509
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,360
Right.

510
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,880
There is also a problem with the root.

511
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
The solution is relatively clear.

512
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,040
This policy

513
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,200
is quite a solution

514
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
to our current debate.

515
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,400
It's not right either.

516
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
Once this mechanism is introduced,

517
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
how to define excessive consumption?

518
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,760
How to define

519
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,880
the level of excessive consumption?

520
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,960
How to divide this category?

521
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
All these problems

522
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,400
will make this problem

523
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,280
gradually unsolvable.

524
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,440
You figured it out?

525
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,040
Your thinking

526
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,640
completely answers

527
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,120
the analysis

528
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,200
of gain-loss ratio.

529
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,880
I estimate that the gain-loss ratio is very high.

530
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,600
No.

531
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,000
Why?

532
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,960
This is

533
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,200
not a policy debate.

534
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,640
This is not a policy analysis.

535
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm simply struggling with

536
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,600
whether he meets this requirement.

537
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,960
Ma Nan, it's all your fault.

538
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
I just say it casually.

539
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,400
Look.

540
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,040
The problem comes out after the analysis, right?

541
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,400
Ah.

542
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,200
Ma Nan

543
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,120
A friend of yours

544
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,800
quarrels with his girlfriend.

545
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,320
He feels deeply wronged.

546
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Because

547
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,920
he is more rational.

548
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,840
But his girlfriend

549
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,240
is more sensual.

550
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,280
In fact,

551
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,000
your friend and his girlfriend

552
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,240
are you and Xiaoyu, right?

553
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,080
Are you a god?

554
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,680
I can tell.

555
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
So what should I do?

556
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,160
It's very simple.

557
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,320
This is obviously

558
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
an important but dangerous question

559
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,920
of choosing truth or love.

560
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,840
Choose?

561
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,040
Do you know that sentence

562
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,880
that has been verified

563
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,640
by countless men

564
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,440
for thousands of years?

565
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,000
Women are right

566
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,760
no matter what they say.

567
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,360
No.

568
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,240
I don't agree with Xiaoyu.

569
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,440
Can't I reason with her?

570
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,920
You think you reason with her.

571
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,960
But she thinks you don't love her.

572
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,320
That's too unreasonable.

573
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,800
I...

574
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,320
Then

575
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,640
let me ask you a question.

576
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,480
Do you wanna be lonely all your life?

577
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,320
Listen to me.

578
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Darwin said

579
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,000
that there were two types of men in this world.

580
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,920
The first type of men

581
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,880
felt that women were right.

582
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,320
The second type of men didn't think so.

583
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,440
Then

584
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,560
all the women

585
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,880
married the first type of men.

586
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,760
The second type of men became extinct.

587
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,680
Did Darwin say that?

588
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,520
It doesn't matter.

589
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
It is important that you understand

590
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,120
that no matter what a woman asks,

591
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,160
you can only answer I agree.

592
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,640
Then

593
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,360
I'll give you a training.

594
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,280
No matter what I say,

595
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,040
you answer that I agree.

596
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,560
OK.

597
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:19,880
Well.

598
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,360
The earth is square.

599
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,160
I agree.

600
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,600
You are a woman.

601
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:28,880
Say it.

602
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,160
I agree.

603
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,640
Right.

604
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Mu Xiaoyu is right.

605
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,360
I agree.

606
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,800
Louder please.

607
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,360
I agree.

608
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,840
Make it clear.

609
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,480
I agree.

610
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,600
Recite it once.

611
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,600
I agree.

612
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,120
One more time.

613
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,960
I agree.

614
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,440
One more time.

615
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,360
I agree.

616
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,400
Done.

617
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,480
Tell her that tomorrow.

618
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,480
Xiaoyu

619
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,280
I wanna talk to you again

620
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,160
about Ran Da.

621
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,680
No need for it.

622
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,120
There's nothing to talk about.

623
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,680
I won't change my mind.

624
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,280
I still don't think

625
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,120
he's eligible

626
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,200
for the grant.

627
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,840
I agree.

628
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,640
You agree?

629
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,240
I think

630
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,000
everything you say is right.

631
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
I agree with you.

632
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,840
I agree.

633
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,200
You disagreed before.

634
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,080
Why do you suddenly agree?

635
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,160
I

636
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,480
think carefully about

637
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,760
every word you said.

638
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,840
Anyway, I'm just changed

639
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,360
by your idea.

640
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,160
I agree with you.

641
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,400
Then why do I feel

642
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,160
so awkward?

643
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
Are you a bit emotional?

644
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,360
Emotional?

645
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,240
No.

646
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,080
How dare I?

647
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,360
Nan Bei, you think it interesting?

648
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,320
Yes.

649
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,760
What do you mean?

650
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,200
I mean that I don't agree.

651
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,360
I don't agree with you.

652
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,680
This is moral coercion.

653
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,040
You can disagree with me.

654
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,320
So why did you say yes?

655
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,760
Because you're petty.

656
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,440
You...

657
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,680
Just because I have different views

658
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,280
from yours,

659
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
you snub me, alienate me

660
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,440
and deliberately target me.

661
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm so petty

662
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,160
in your mind,

663
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,000
right?

664
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,480
I didn't think so before.

665
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,640
I feel it now.

666
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Ah.

667
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,200
Why do I feel

668
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,120
that they are more and more like a divorced couple?

669
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,600
So we are

670
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,360
done here.

671
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,200
I will definitely be awarded to the man.

672
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
I will definitely be awarded to the woman.

673
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,640
We won't be able to

674
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,200
play together anymore.

675
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,240
It's hard for us to even meet.

676
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,600
Dandan

677
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,760
Dango

678
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,240
Take care.

679
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,280
Take care.

680
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,520
You've been angry for so long.

681
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,520
It's time for you to make up.

682
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,200
So what?

683
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,240
No need.

684
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,760
I'm so petty.

685
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,840
I don't wanna make up with him.

686
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm so boring.

687
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,480
I don't make up either.

688
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,720
Connected.

689
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,480
Hello.

690
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,240
Come here.

691
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
Hello.

692
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,240
Hello everyone.

693
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,200
Hello.

694
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,560
You've seen

695
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,040
our first two competitions.

696
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,480
Please assign us

697
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,440
the next task.

698
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,040
Well.

699
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,720
I've seen

700
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,880
your first few competitions.

701
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,200
You are generally good.

702
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,160
But you have many flaws in details.

703
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,400
Your skills are maturing.

704
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,120
But your content is slightly insufficient.

705
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,800
You have a unique style.

706
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
But that means no style.

707
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,240
Hello.

708
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,480
Can you not pause

709
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,120
when you talk?

710
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm just kidding.

711
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,200
Let me ask you.

712
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
You have won several competitions recently.

713
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,040
Do you think

714
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,480
these are knockout blows?

715
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,600
Coach

716
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
These victories

717
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,640
are a little bit...

718
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,760
It doesn't matter.

719
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:20,960
Just tell me

720
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
how can we

721
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,440
win thoroughly in a debate?

722
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,000
Xiaoyu, you answer.

723
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,640
I think in a debate,

724
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,920
we should

725
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,600
grasp...

726
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,720
umm...

727
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,480
its depth

728
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,080
and level,

729
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,960
and push them ahead.

730
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,600
We failed to grasp

731
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,440
the depth and level of the debate in these competitions.

732
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,880
That's right.

733
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,080
How to grasp

734
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,960
the level

735
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,680
and depth

736
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,560
of a debate?

737
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
You should learn to

738
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,840
walk into the situation

739
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,040
under debate.

740
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,480
You should dig out the essence of the problem

741
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,240
from the level of the reality.

742
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,760
For example,

743
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,360
the last debate

744
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,160
was the significance of

745
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
sharing economy to social development.

746
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,080
From beginning to end,

747
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,440
the other side was saying that the sharing economy

748
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
can let the public participate,

749
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
let the public share mutual benefit,

750
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
save resources

751
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,440
and promote social prosperity.

752
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,960
Is this really the case?

753
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,680
Although you used your skills

754
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,800
to refute them,

755
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,200
you never completely

756
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,280
rejected this argument.

757
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,240
But if

758
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,600
you really investigate

759
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,880
and talk to some people

760
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
engaged in bicycle industry and portable charger industry,

761
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,960
you will know

762
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,240
that the so-called sharing economy

763
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,360
is essentially Internet leasing.

764
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,240
Those are just superficial.

765
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,200
Its business logic

766
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,360
is the reality.

767
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,280
In the future, you should go out

768
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,320
and see more

769
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,360
when you analyze the debate.

770
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,240
Understand?

771
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,680
Xiaoyu

772
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,840
The review panel

773
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,880
is closing tomorrow.

774
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,080
OK.

775
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,080
Today, the old coach said

776
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,160
that we can't just think without action.

777
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
No matter how different

778
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,440
our opinions are,

779
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,400
let's meet Ran Da today

780
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,360
and then make the judgment.

781
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,320
OK.

782
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,600
If you are a beginner,

783
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,000
I suggest you buy this pair.

784
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,640
It has a more non-slip upper.

785
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,800
And its lining

786
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,440
does not rub the feet.

787
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,320
It has smooth bearings.

788
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,040
It has a raised

789
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,720
and impact-resistant toe.

790
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,880
It has a good

791
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,480
cushioning effect.

792
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,440
And it has four gears that can be adjusted.

793
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
Its wheels are wear-resistant and shock-resistant.

794
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,280
It has a removable brake.

795
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,840
If you are a beginner,

796
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,600
I suggest you buy wheels

797
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,920
with the hardness of 70

798
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,200
and the diameter of 72.

799
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,200
It's too dangerous for you

800
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,280
if you go too fast.

801
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
You're so professional.

802
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,320
The pair you're wearing

803
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
is not for beginners, right?

804
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,360
Right,

805
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,000
of course.

806
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,480
But this pair is not too good.

807
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,640
How much are they?

808
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,840
4,000 yuan.

809
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,320
The price is so high.

810
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,240
That's the original price.

811
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,640
I certainly can't afford it.

812
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,320
I've had my eye on it for over a year.

813
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,880
But the price is so high.

814
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,920
Later,

815
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,880
I saw a pair of 97% new ones

816
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,960
on the second-hand platform.

817
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,760
Then I asked the seller

818
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,000
if he could wait for me

819
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,040
for another two months.

820
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,880
At that time,

821
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,200
I worked as a summer worker

822
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,920
for two months

823
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,040
and then bought it.

824
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,040
Oh.

825
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,920
So that's what it is.

826
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,280
In fact,

827
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,680
I think as long as you are skilled,

828
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,960
it doesn't matter

829
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,840
if your shoes show signs of wear.

830
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,720
Look.

831
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,120
When I turned just now,

832
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,840
the edge of the wheel

833
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,000
rubbed against the ground and passed.

834
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,000
If I hadn't lifted

835
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,920
my right foot early

836
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,840
and rushed to change lanes,

837
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,440
I would have fallen.

838
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,680
If the shoes were brand new,

839
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
I could have just slipped a round

840
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,120
at least five seconds ahead of time.

841
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,080
You're so good.

842
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,200
I gotta run.

843
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,760
If you have any other questions, you can ask me.

844
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,800
Well.

845
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,600
It seems that he really likes this.

846
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,920
Right.

847
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,720
Are you okay?

848
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,640
Do you have any ideas yet?

849
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,040
I agree with him.

850
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,400
I also quite sympathize with him.

851
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,320
But

852
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,960
I still don't think

853
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,840
it can be agreed.

854
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,760
It's quite good.

855
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,840
You change your mind?

856
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Of course not.

857
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
You don't wanna convince me either?

858
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,360
I never wanna

859
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,240
convince you, okay?

860
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,640
I think

861
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
no matter what decision you make,

862
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,560
you must believe

863
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,680
that you make the right one.

864
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,560
We have analyzed

865
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,520
all the possibilities,

866
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,400
and we have visited and investigated together.

867
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,280
So just judge

868
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
according to your own ideas.

869
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,720
I still stick to my choice.

870
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,400
But I also respect your idea.

871
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,920
Xiaoyu

872
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,200
Let's make up.

873
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,880
Actually, I thought about it.

874
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,400
You should not be the kind of person

875
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,160
who quarrels with me

876
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,920
because you disagree with me.

877
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Umm.

878
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
You already know

879
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,360
I broke your headphones

880
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,520
the other week?

881
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,800
That's really not my fault.

882
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,840
That's Dandan' fault.

883
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,600
He asked me

884
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,320
to try if the headphones

885
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,000
were waterproof,

886
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,040
so I tried.

887
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,440
That's really not my fault.

888
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,480
If you're unhappy...

889
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,960
You smile.

890
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,640
You smile.

891
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,240
If you smile, it means you're no longer angry.

892
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,200
Go away.

893
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,520
The fourth sign of liking a person

894
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
is that you will make some

895
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,480
special feminine gestures

896
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,920
in front of him,

897
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,480
such as running your hand through your hair.

898
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,800
All that's left is about Ran Da.

899
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Please state clearly your stands.

900
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,160
I still hold the same opinion as before.

901
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Me too.

902
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,920
And you two?

903
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,720
I think

904
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,040
the purpose of the grant

905
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,400
is for a better college education

906
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,440
and the purpose of a college education

907
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,800
is to give each of us

908
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
more freedom and choices.

909
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,320
So we can't give up eating for fear of choking.

910
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,640
I still stick to my previous point of view.

911
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,600
I think

912
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,840
resources given to those who need them more

913
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,120
is what we really expect,

914
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,200
and even is right

915
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
what the applicants think.

916
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,720
There is no wrong choice.

917
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,920
But it is right

918
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,720
to pay for the choice.

919
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,160
So

920
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,400
I also stick to my previous opinion.

921
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,640
But I have a supplementary document.

922
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,960
These are some ways

923
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,880
I propose that the university changes the grant.

924
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,160
We can use big data

925
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,000
to analyze

926
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,520
students' spending habits,

927
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,520
the number of cafeteria visits, food

928
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
and food types

929
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,080
to nominate places for subsidies.

930
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,960
To prevent their misjudgment,

931
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,120
we can also

932
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,800
send text messages to these students

933
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,400
in advance asking for their opinions.

934
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,840
If they say

935
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,440
they

936
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,400
don't need the subsidy,

937
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,240
we can

938
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
respect their opinions.

939
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,920
And the whole process

940
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,880
is confidential,

941
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,720
which can

942
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,560
protect some students'

943
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,440
self-esteem.

944
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,480
I hope our opinions

945
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,720
can help the university.

946
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,640
Very good.

947
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,800
Although every year there is a debate

948
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,760
on one case

949
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,840
in a panel,

950
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,120
you are the first

951
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,200
to come up with ideas for improvement.

952
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,160
This is done by Nan Bei with me.

953
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,800
Please vote.

954
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,440
Those who support Ran Da, please show your hands.

955
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,800
Xiaoyu

956
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,080
Please help me see

957
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,160
if this shade of lipstick

958
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,920
will make my skin look fair.

959
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,920
Not bad.

960
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,000
This is very cheap.

961
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Let's buy it together.

962
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,840
There are so many shades.

963
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,400
You pick one for me.

964
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,360
Which one?

965
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,760
Are they different?

966
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,520
You know nothing.

967
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,400
Go away.

968
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,200
Just this one.

969
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,360
I wanna buy eight.

970
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,240
Baby, you just have one mouth.

971
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
Why do you buy so many?

972
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,960
You see clearly.

973
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,160
This is a sample.

974
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,520
It's small.

975
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,040
I just wanna choose

976
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,640
a shade that suits me best.

977
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,800
I think

978
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,680
a girl is beautiful

979
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
without makeup.

980
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,040
So no makeup is needed.

981
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,160
Please cherish the time

982
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,720
when you can be naturally beautiful,

983
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,400
okay?

984
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,440
He's right.

985
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
But because the words come out of his mouth,

986
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,800
I wanna hit him.

987
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,240
Last week,

988
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,440
our tutor talked to us

989
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,600
about choosing the major.

990
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Really?

991
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,680
What do you wanna choose?

992
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,680
I must think about it.

993
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,800
Nan Bei, what do you wanna choose?

994
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,080
I choose...

995
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,520
Is that enough?

996
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,640
I don't choose.

997
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,960
Boiling water overflows.

998
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,880
Clear and simple.

999
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
Even after

1000
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,080
thousands of years,

1001
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,960
boiled water

1002
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,400
still has vigor and vitality.

1003
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,800
The combination of tea and boiled water

1004
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,400
is a traditional

1005
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,560
and Zen-filled way

1006
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,120
to entertain guests

1007
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,040
since Chinese civilization.

1008
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,400
We can experience sweetness in bitterness.

1009
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,920
We can conform to nature.

1010
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,000
Ma Nan

1011
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,600
We agreed to train.

1012
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,120
Why are we doing this?

1013
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,680
Train?

1014
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,320
I'm going to help you get rehabilitated.

1015
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,600
I'm already well.

1016
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,920
Then why do you make me tea?

1017
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,800
Hao

1018
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Don't be angry.

1019
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,720
Tea, please.

1020
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,280
Please.

1021
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,680
As a young man,

1022
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,280
why do you

1023
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
have the same hobby

1024
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,520
as old people?

1025
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,280
Ah.

1026
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,480
Let me tell you.

1027
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
I have

1028
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,440
bad legs now,

1029
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,920
so I can't play basketball

1030
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,160
or walk well.

1031
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,920
Are you?

1032
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,760
I...

1033
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,280
I'm okay.

1034
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,760
So

1035
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,120
this tea is for knee protection.

1036
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,560
If you have tea

1037
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,280
for treating eyes,

1038
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,520
please give it to Nan Bei.

1039
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,360
It'll be best

1040
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,120
if it can treat glaucoma, cataract

1041
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,960
and myopia with 20 diopters.

1042
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,040
What happened to them?

1043
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,120
Nan Bei peeks at beautiful girls,

1044
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,720
so she is jealous.

1045
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,400
I...

1046
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,160
I don't think they are beautiful.

1047
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,480
Look at yourself.

1048
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,200
You must think they are beautiful.

1049
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,800
Your eyes are almost glued to them.

1050
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,360
Oh.

1051
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,640
Why do you care so much?

1052
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,600
You're jealous, right?

1053
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,320
You talk nonsense.

1054
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,080
I'm afraid that you'll lower

1055
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,840
the aesthetics of our team.

1056
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,240
Hao

1057
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Don't we have any plans today?

1058
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,240
You must be tired

1059
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
because there were many competitions in the previous period.

1060
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
There are fewer competitions

1061
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,920
between now and winter vacation.

1062
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,040
So I suggest

1063
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,920
you make

1064
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,520
a special training plan

1065
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,600
for the problems

1066
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,400
in the previous competition,

1067
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,040
OK?

1068
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,640
That's great.

1069
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,400
Let's get started.

1070
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,040
Hao

1071
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,040
Umm...

1072
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,520
It is rare for us to relax for a few days.

1073
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,600
Let's relax more.

1074
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,520
Don't be in such a hurry.

1075
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,520
What's wrong?

1076
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,440
This delays you to see the beauty?

1077
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,920
All right.

1078
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,040
Please.

1079
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,000
This can relieve internal heat.

1080
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,040
I think

1081
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,640
people all like beautiful things.

1082
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,080
Makeup

1083
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,320
is the same as city outlook.

1084
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,120
These are both for beauty, right?

1085
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,760
Right.

1086
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
So why did you say

1087
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,560
it's best for girls not to wear makeup

1088
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,480
before they are twenty?

1089
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,760
I wasn't

1090
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,160
mature enough then.

1091
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,120
All right.

1092
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,240
Stop arguing.

1093
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,320
It's not important.

1094
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,320
Besides,

1095
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,520
who doesn't wear makeup

1096
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,200
at our age...

1097
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,160
Hao, you wear makeup?

1098
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,520
Light makeup.

1099
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,960
You wear makeup?

1100
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,320
Why can't we see that?

1101
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,040
She is capable.

1102
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,840
It's called foggy nude look,

1103
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,040
commonly known as no makeup.

1104
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,440
We don't wear makeup.

1105
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,400
We're different.

1106
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,360
We are natural beauty.

1107
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,960
You don't understand.

1108
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,280
The British sociologist

1109
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,080
Mike Battoff said

1110
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,960
that women who wear makeup

1111
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,200
earn more

1112
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,920
than women who don't wear makeup.

1113
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,320
And they are more confident and beautiful.

1114
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,480
And they have more suitors.

1115
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,400
Really?

1116
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,640
Mike...

1117
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,960
Mike...

1118
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,080
Please say the name again.

1119
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,640
You just make it up.

1120
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,880
You've grown up. I can't fool you anymore.

1121
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,240
I think

1122
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,080
women dress up for their beholders.

1123
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,760
They must have their reasons

1124
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,920
for making up.

1125
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,320
You don't respect feminism

1126
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,440
by saying that.

1127
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,920
Doesn't it matter how you feel?

1128
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,600
If no one likes,

1129
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,120
will her own beauty be gone?

1130
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,320
If you

1131
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,240
like a person,

1132
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,040
don't you

1133
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,120
dress yourself up

1134
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,240
to attract his attention?

1135
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,520
No.

1136
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,320
I will.

1137
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,480
If I like a person,

1138
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
I will wear my AJ,

1139
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,960
put my hand in my pocket,

1140
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,680
walk to the beautiful woman

1141
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,920
and say to her

1142
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,520
lady,

1143
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,760
what's up?

1144
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,160
Are you crazy?

1145
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,000
It's getting more and more interesting.
