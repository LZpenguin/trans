00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,480
Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP02

2
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,160
Team leader

3
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Team leader

4
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,400
What are you doing?

5
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,640
Nothing.

6
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,240
That's

7
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,440
what has happened.

8
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,560
Because both of your teams

9
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,640
won

10
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,920
yesterday's competition.

11
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,160
And you did very well.

12
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,240
So

13
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
I give you a suggestion

14
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,920
on behalf of the university.

15
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Combine the two teams

16
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,560
to form a new school team

17
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,080
and select suitable teammates.

18
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,520
What do you think?

19
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
No way!

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,120
We still hope you

21
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
can reconsider it.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,320
After all, husky is

23
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,360
essentially different from wolf.

24
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,920
Wolf.

25
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Excuse me.

26
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
We're human.

27
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,920
Human needs to protect animals.

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,440
Dogs are our good friends

29
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,640
and so are wild animals,

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,520
even if they like to bite.

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,360
I heard that a debate team

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,840
narrowly won the low-end competition yesterday.

33
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,160
My fellow debaters, if you spread rumors again,

34
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,280
beware of our malicious retaliation.

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,320
In fact, in the debate competition,

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,840
whether it is a narrow victory

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
or a big victory,

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,400
as long as you win,

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
it is called a complete victory, right?

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Sir

41
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
There's no problem

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,080
for you to say that about our team.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,560
As for them...

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,320
My fellow debater, do you

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,040
have any misunderstanding about the complete victory?

46
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,160
I heard that it used to seem that someone

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,000
gave up the best debater

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,400
to others, right?

49
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,440
Excuse me, I have to answer the phone.

50
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,320
You guys talk about it

51
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,120
and give me an answer later.

52
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,720
Are you

53
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,840
the senior's girlfriend?

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,160
Are you crazy?

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,760
Why do you fabricate arguments?

56
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,720
Who are you talking about?

57
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm talking about the person who asks the question.

58
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
My fellow debater, please

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
do not sidestep my question.

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,840
Are you

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,920
the senior's girlfriend or not?

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm not.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,000
Is what you said credible?

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,240
Behave yourself.

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Who are you talking about?

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,440
Yin Nan

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,520
There's no one opposite us,

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,680
but why do I always hear

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,360
strange noises?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,280
You're right.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,440
No one.

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,520
It's air.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,480
It's air that buys your university.

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,520
Bro, keep your public persona.

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,040
Bro

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
Maybe I should make a pot of chrysanthemum tea

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,960
to cool you off?

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,280
We are not getting irritated.

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,160
Bad-mannered people get irritated easily.

81
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,120
Why are you everywhere?

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,040
Loser.

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,160
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,840
I'm talking about you.

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,080
All right.

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,800
Why did you

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
go to a hotel room

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,440
with the senior?

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,680
Because we have no place to train.

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
That's for training.

91
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,320
Dango

92
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
Please be ambitious.

93
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,360
Don't waste your time

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,200
on such a bad person.

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Who are you talking about?

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,000
Who are you talking about?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,520
I'm talking about you.

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Say it again.

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,400
How are your discussions going?

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,320
Have you got the results yet?

101
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
Our team of Western University of Science and Technology

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,240
disagrees with it.

103
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Our team of DUFE

104
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,920
disagrees with it even more.

105
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,720
Just in time.

106
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,160
I was just informed.

107
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,960
The university will hold an exhibition match

108
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,720
for your two teams

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
next week.

110
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,160
Who has the final say

111
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,880
depends on who wins.

112
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Do you agree?

113
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,640
Do you hear that?

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,680
After the match,

115
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,400
the school team will be ours.

116
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,480
We agree.

117
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,160
We agree, too.

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,920
Well.

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,240
Looking forward to your wonderful performance.

120
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,320
Let's see who will win.

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,080
Ah.

122
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Why don't Xiaoyu and Yin Nan

123
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
get along well?

124
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Have you ever heard of a story called

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
Other People's Children?

126
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,280
Yes.

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,800
It's an inspiring story.

128
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
And I'm that kind of child.

129
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,880
Ah.

130
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
What happened?

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,480
Tell me.

132
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,920
They were neighbors

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
when they were children.

134
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
Xiaoyu's mother always

135
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
takes Yin Nan as an example.

136
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
She also enrolled them

137
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
in the same interest class.

138
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,080
Miss, I've finished drawing.

139
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm great, right?

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,080
Yin Nan, you draw very well.

141
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,000
Great.

142
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,720
You get a lot of gifts.

143
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
I can barely hold them.

144
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,720
That year,

145
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,080
Xiaoyu finally

146
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,160
got the first place

147
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,120
in the final exam.

148
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
She thought she defeated Yin Nan.

149
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,920
It turned out that

150
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,680
Yin Nan skipped the grade directly.

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,640
She was admitted to the university in advance.

152
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,560
Feel sorry for Xiaoyu.

153
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,320
What are you talking about?

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,200
Nothing.

155
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,080
Ah.

156
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,360
There is no action without consequence.

157
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Karma is a bitch.

158
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,080
If she hadn't forced me,

159
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,840
I wouldn't have become

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,800
what I am now.

161
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,440
Come on, Xiaoyu.

162
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,040
Win for sure, Xiaoyu.

163
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,840
Come on.

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,040
Enjoy yourself.

165
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,080
We'll train later.

166
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,440
Please prepare for the debate and return to the classroom quickly.

167
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,720
My fellow debater, since you have given

168
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,400
a series of...

169
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,360
Friends

170
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,680
The fact that Thanos wears gloves

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,880
on both hands

172
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,160
is not enough to describe

173
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,200
our opponent's horror.

174
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,480
Qiu Lingyan

175
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
used to be the best debater in the district

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
for three consecutive years

177
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,280
during her high school years.

178
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,760
She is good at using logic rings to attack opponents.

179
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
Her defensive counter-attack is also very prominent.

180
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,760
This boy is called Ding Li.

181
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,560
He is the fourth debater.

182
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,920
He is very good at grasping the key points.

183
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,560
It is said that his debate style

184
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,040
is a bit unconventional.

185
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,520
Xiaoyu, Nan Bei

186
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,320
I heard that these next two

187
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,880
are your old friends.

188
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,440
Please introduce them.

189
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,320
In high school,

190
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
everyone called Yin Nan the Great Devil.

191
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,080
I don't think so anyway.

192
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,000
How's her ranking?

193
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,880
She luckily won a championship

194
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
in her first year of high school.

195
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Xiaoyu was the runner-up.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,240
She was also lucky in her sophomore year of high school.

197
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,560
She was still the runner-up.

198
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,400
What about Liu Yanze?

199
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Liu Yanze

200
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,680
is known as Invincible Asia in Dongzhou.

201
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,840
Hum.

202
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,960
I think they are just more alike in gender.

203
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,560
That means

204
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,600
neither of them has ever lost.

205
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,720
Soon.

206
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,640
Ah.

207
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,280
Liu Yanze is so good.

208
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,640
I have such a good taste.

209
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,240
Now is the critical moment.

210
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,560
Please stop thinking about falling in love.

211
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,440
I also get their record last year

212
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,800
from Mr. Li.

213
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,320
25 wins and 0 loss.

214
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,120
Nine withdrawals.

215
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,760
Look, friends.

216
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,760
That's what they are.

217
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,920
They only dare to compete against people who are inferior to them.

218
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
They flinch when they meet someone better than them.

219
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,880
We don't have to be afraid of them at all.

220
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,320
The reason for nine withdrawals

221
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,640
is that their opponents thought they were too strong,

222
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,760
so they withdrew voluntarily.

223
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,120
We have nothing to fear.

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Even

225
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,520
a blind squirrel

226
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,640
can find nuts.

227
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
They're not nuts.

228
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
What are you doing?

229
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
Stop chatting.

230
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,680
Ah.

231
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,240
Time is short and tasks are numerous.

232
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,920
Let's train right now.

233
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,560
Oh.

234
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,960
You're good.

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,640
Why are you

236
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,840
so keen on the competition?

237
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,160
I can't

238
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,640
lose face in front of my Prince Charming.

239
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,720
I'll win him over.

240
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll beat him with strength.

241
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,680
Right.

242
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,520
I'm going to rely on this game

243
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,400
to let Liu Yanze know

244
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,360
who the Dad is.

245
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,800
Let Yin Nan know

246
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
who the Mom is.

247
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,800
Well, I'm also encouraged.

248
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,760
Friends

249
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,520
Let's

250
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,680
make a plan now.

251
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,440
OK.

252
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,280
Come on.

253
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,520
Finally.

254
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,520
From 7 a.m.

255
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,840
to 12 p.m.,

256
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,360
minus the time to eat and sleep,

257
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,200
we need to train intensively

258
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280
for 12 hours.

259
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
The training content includes

260
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,280
voice,

261
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,240
logical inertia,

262
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,480
on-the-spot reaction,

263
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,680
watching of classic events,

264
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,200
review of competitions

265
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,880
and others.

266
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,880
How about it?

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,560
Not bad, right?

268
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,160
En.

269
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,400
It's good that you can stick to it.

270
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,760
Sa

271
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,920
You're underestimating us.

272
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,360
I think this amount of training

273
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,680
is just so so for us.

274
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,040
Hao, right?

275
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,640
I really wanna believe you.

276
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,600
But

277
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,520
from what I know about you,

278
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,880
I think it's a little impossible.

279
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,720
I set my alarm

280
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,600
at 6:00 a.m. now.

281
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,920
All right.

282
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,760
It's like we don't know

283
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,000
how you spend your day.

284
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,040
How do I spend?

285
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,680
The alarm clock goes off at six o'clock.

286
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,640
From the moment

287
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,440
he opens his eyes,

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
the only thing that moves

289
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,200
all over his body

290
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,360
is his thumb.

291
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,360
This state

292
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,920
lasts until ten o'clock in the evening.

293
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,720
He actually

294
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,000
watches TikTok to fall asleep.

295
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,640
When he wakes up,

296
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,240
a new day begins.

297
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,000
Look.

298
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,320
This is his day.

299
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,080
I don't even bother to talk about you.

300
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
You think you're good?

301
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,280
What about me?

302
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,520
You spend the morning in a recurring tangle of

303
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:33,960
getting up

304
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,000
and not getting up.

305
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,840
At noon,

306
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,800
hunger prompts you

307
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,640
to start a new day.

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,680
But the sun

309
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,880
blocks your view of TV series.

310
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,440
So you prepare snacks

311
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
and drinks,

312
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,280
hide in the curtains,

313
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
open the video website

314
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,960
and continue

315
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,480
watching TV dramas

316
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,480
until you fall asleep.

317
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,760
This is her day.

318
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,440
Ah.

319
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,480
Look.

320
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,640
Do they look like old friends

321
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,760
who have known each other for 30 years

322
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
complaining about each other here?

323
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
Dango, please don't waste the picture,

324
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,200
okay?

325
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,200
It's your day

326
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,960
to change my TV series

327
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,760
into your Taobao.

328
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,080
What are you watching?

329
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm shopping online.

330
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,080
What do you wanna buy?

331
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
You like this lipstick?

332
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
I also like this lipstick.

333
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,960
Buy it.

334
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,400
I still need to think about it.

335
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
What if this lipstick

336
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,680
doesn't suit me?

337
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,680
If you like it, buy it.

338
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,520
Don't think about it.

339
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,320
Why do you

340
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,560
train so hard?

341
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,280
Buy it.

342
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,480
I wanna defeat Yin Nan.

343
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
You think too much.

344
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,600
If you like it but you don't buy it,

345
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
how can you beat her?

346
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,840
Buy it.

347
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,360
Buy it.

348
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Please calm down, don't...

349
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
Please don't suppress yourself.

350
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,880
Buy it.

351
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,960
Please be nice to yourself.

352
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,440
Buy it.

353
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,160
Please reward yourself. Buy it.

354
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,880
OK.

355
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,720
So I'll buy one, too.

356
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,280
So we both have it.

357
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,280
But don't worry, Hao.

358
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,680
In order to beat Western University of Science and Technology,

359
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,240
and preserve

360
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
our beautiful home,

361
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,920
I will definitely quit watching TV shows,

362
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,760
TikTok,

363
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,640
and Taobao.

364
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,120
Well.

365
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
Let's take a five-minute break

366
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,080
and then start training.

367
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,480
Hum.

368
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,600
Hao

369
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
Making plans over the past few days

370
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
has killed

371
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,920
all my brain cells.

372
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,080
I need a rest.

373
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,240
Hao, or we'll get up early

374
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,160
tomorrow morning.

375
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,880
Please don't train today.

376
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,120
All right.

377
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
Please go to bed early today.

378
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,720
Let's start training

379
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,760
at seven o'clock tomorrow morning.

380
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes, madam.

381
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,080
Hao, what's the matter?

382
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,080
All auditoriums for competition

383
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
have been lent out.

384
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Even all large classrooms

385
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,360
have been arranged.

386
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,680
Our promotional videos

387
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,160
have been released.

388
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,240
How humiliating

389
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,280
if the location is a small classroom by then.

390
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,680
It doesn't matter.

391
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,200
Let me ask Mr. Li again.

392
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
There's the spare auditorium

393
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,760
at the north entrance.

394
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,360
The spare auditorium at the north entrance?

395
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,320
I heard it's haunted.

396
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
It's not that dramatic.

397
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,880
I've held events there.

398
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,280
There's just old equipment,

399
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,880
air leak in winter

400
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
and rain leak in summer.

401
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
It's not that scary.

402
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Hello, FlashEx.

403
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,600
Coming.

404
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,520
Thank you.

405
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,160
Dango, what do you buy again?

406
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,560
Good stuff.

407
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,160
Xiaoyu

408
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,000
Sa

409
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,880
And mine.

410
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,520
Yes.

411
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,640
From now on,

412
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,360
no one can use the cell phone as an excuse

413
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,080
to forget the training time because it is dying.

414
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
From now on,

415
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,400
we should

416
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,080
take the time of this watch as the standard.

417
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,920
Well.

418
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,120
From now on,

419
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,360
let's

420
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,600
get the competition back

421
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,760
by the hour.

422
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,240
By the minute.

423
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
By the second.

424
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,440
Yes.

425
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,640
Come on.

426
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,080
I can see

427
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,960
that you didn't sleep well last night.

428
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,080
You too.

429
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
You must have stayed up late

430
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,600
to read the material again last night.

431
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,040
You're amazing.

432
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,920
You too.

433
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
Let me give you the thumbs-up.

434
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,600
In that case,

435
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
let's get started.

436
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,360
Who should we start with?

437
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,640
Nan Bei

438
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,040
Look.

439
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,720
He goes to the left and is touched.

440
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,120
Here he comes again.

441
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,200
He...

442
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,840
What are you watching?

443
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,680
Look, Dog-headed Brother updates the video.

444
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,400
He is performing a lion dance

445
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,640
in his dorm room

446
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,480
with that husky pillow as his head.

447
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,480
Ah.

448
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,960
Great.

449
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,480
You also have

450
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,160
this pillow.

451
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,880
Hum.

452
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,200
Ladies first.

453
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
Either of you can start.

454
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,200
Let me add to that.

455
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,040
Xiaoyu

456
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
You must have a lot of thoughts

457
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,840
to say.

458
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,200
Come on.

459
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,800
You first.

460
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
Xiaoyu, let's watch the TV series together.

461
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,560
In preparation for next week's debate competition,

462
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,040
I have vowed

463
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
to abstain from all recreational activities.

464
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,040
Oh.

465
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,280
It is the century competition

466
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,160
between you and Western University of Science and Technology,

467
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,480
which claims to represent the pinnacle

468
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,880
of modern Chinese debate in China.

469
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,680
How do you know that?

470
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,880
Now the whole university is spreading it.

471
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,680
Xiaoyu

472
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,200
You are now the heroine

473
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,680
representing DUFE.

474
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm with you.

475
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:46,920
What's wrong?

476
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,240
Ah.

477
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,640
It's okay.

478
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,040
You should

479
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,920
make full preparations for the competition first.

480
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,280
Ah.

481
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,880
How did this happen?

482
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,320
Ah.

483
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,200
Qincai is mine.

484
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,480
No, she's mine.

485
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,200
So what?

486
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,000
You guys stop fighting.

487
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,560
Stop fighting.

488
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,600
Dango

489
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,160
Or you first.

490
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,160
I'll sort out my thoughts.

491
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,280
I'll sort out

492
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
your words later.

493
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,160
Why are we

494
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,480
so humble?

495
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,480
Nan Bei

496
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,040
Ah.

497
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,640
Don't you always have trouble holding your words?

498
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,800
You first.

499
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,880
It's okay.

500
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,680
You both can.

501
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,720
You first.

502
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,280
Ah.

503
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,840
Don't be polite to us.

504
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,400
Come on.

505
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,880
You first.

506
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,840
Come on.

507
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,880
No.

508
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
If you go on like this,

509
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,560
I have reason to believe

510
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,120
that you didn't read the information

511
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,400
last night.

512
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,400
It would not be too much

513
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,920
for me to suspect

514
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,600
that you did not prepare anything

515
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
last night, right?

516
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,960
Why do you two say that?

517
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,720
It's as if none of us

518
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
has prepared the information

519
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
and none of us wants to start first.

520
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,800
Nan Bei, you must

521
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,760
have watched TikTok all night last night.

522
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,080
You must have watched TV shows again.

523
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,560
You both are too much.

524
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,760
I just shop for daily necessities.

525
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,440
Strictly speaking,

526
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,280
this is not an entertainment.

527
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,160
Why?

528
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,200
We have an appointment to train together.

529
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,880
You don't keep your word.

530
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,520
Hao

531
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
How is the preparation for the competition going?

532
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,480
They are all working very hard

533
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,000
and enthusiastically to prepare for the competition.

534
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,200
What's going on?

535
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,560
I'm right.

536
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,760
Great.

537
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,120
What is your business?

538
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
Mr. Li

539
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,320
Now

540
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,760
the auditoriums for competition

541
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,800
have been lent out.

542
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,840
I would like to ask

543
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
who is managing

544
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
the spare auditorium at the north gate.

545
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,400
The spare auditorium at the north gate?

546
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Let me take a look.

547
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,000
Take a look.

548
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Yes, it's this.

549
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,000
This is the clubroom

550
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,080
of Sunset Club.

551
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
Sunset Club?

552
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,600
Look.

553
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,640
This is the signature of the person in charge.

554
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Mr. Li

555
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,000
I'd like to ask about

556
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,640
the use of this auditorium.

557
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,760
I'd like to talk to their club about

558
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,960
whether we can use it together.

559
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,200
You mean

560
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,240
to find this person in charge?

561
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,160
Yes.

562
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,400
I have to remind you

563
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,160
that if you wanna look for help from this person,

564
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,080
you must be

565
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
fully prepared mentally.

566
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,560
Ah.

567
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,200
Excuse me, are you Ma Nan?

568
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Yes, I'm.

569
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,480
Who are you?

570
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,320
Hello.

571
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm Tao Hao from the Students' Union.

572
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,680
We both serve in the Students' Union.

573
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,880
But I never

574
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,840
met you at the student union.

575
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,160
This is normal.

576
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
I don't stay there very often.

577
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,000
Ma Nan

578
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,800
I come to see you this time

579
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
because my debate team

580
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,120
wants to borrow the auditorium

581
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,320
to play a game.

582
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
I heard from Mr. Li

583
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,680
that it is now used

584
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,720
by a club called Sunset Club,

585
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,200
right?

586
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,560
Right.

587
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,720
Can you

588
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,080
lend it to us?

589
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,640
I don't think so.

590
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Sunset Club has many activities.

591
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,800
Ma Nan

592
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,960
This competition

593
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,880
is very important for us.

594
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Is there any other way...

595
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,280
Once upon a time,

596
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,160
Alexander the Great,

597
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,400
king of Macedonia,

598
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
visited the philosopher Diogenes

599
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,480
when he was passing through Corinth.

600
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,120
He then asked Diogenes.

601
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
He said, Mr. Diogenes,

602
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,600
whatever you want

603
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,960
I can give you.

604
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
Guess what Diogenes answered.

605
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,440
Get out of the way, please.

606
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
You're blocking my sunlight.

607
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,640
So you know it.

608
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,320
I think that if you don't know,

609
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,560
it'll work better if I say it.

610
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,520
You're blocking my sunlight.

611
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,800
I get it.

612
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,120
I'm Diogenes.

613
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,880
You're Alexander.

614
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,880
I'm being sarcastic, you know?

615
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,280
So...

616
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,080
Ma Nan

617
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,680
Please give me the contact

618
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
of Sunset Club directly.

619
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,480
I'll contact them myself.

620
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,440
The contact of Sunset Club

621
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,720
is in

622
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,880
the student union's record book.

623
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,640
No need for that.

624
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,280
They are too busy

625
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,360
and probably don't have time.

626
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,200
Here's the deal.

627
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,040
You wanna

628
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,560
borrow the auditorium for one day.

629
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
You write an application

630
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,040
and give it to me.

631
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,560
Then I hand it over to the superiors.

632
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,160
If they agree,

633
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,080
I'll lend you the classroom key.

634
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,480
Okay, thanks.

635
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,480
Oh.

636
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,520
Please continue

637
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,600
to enjoy the sunshine.

638
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,400
Mr. Diogenes

639
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,240
It seems we

640
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,520
are all in bad shape.

641
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,760
Let's recite

642
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,320
the article of the brain box to boost our energy.

643
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,000
Come on.

644
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Let's recite this paragraph.

645
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,680
When everyone

646
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,320
is reciting the manuscript

647
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,720
to be perfect,

648
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,000
I will advise you to leave.

649
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,440
In this way,

650
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,280
In this way,

651
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,440
your usual language,

652
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,560
occasional stuttering,

653
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,120
incoherent words under excitement

654
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,080
are all weapons instead.

655
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
When everyone

656
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
is improvising

657
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
imperfectly,

658
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
I advise you to recite the manuscript.

659
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,760
At this point,

660
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,080
At this point, the words under excitement,

661
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,280
the smooth rhythm,

662
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,240
the sentences

663
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,440
with parallelism and rhyme

664
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,800
become conspicuous.

665
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,920
I really like this paragraph.

666
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm also right.

667
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,200
Ah.

668
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,080
Convention.

669
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,160
Gentlemen's agreement.

670
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,400
All entertainment is prohibited

671
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,480
prior to the competition.

672
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,560
Let's monitor each other.

673
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,480
The stricter the punishment system is,

674
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,960
the better it is.

675
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,160
Deal.

676
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,280
Ma Nan

677
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,320
All the documents

678
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
have been signed by the teacher.

679
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,720
Now you can

680
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,560
give me the contact

681
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,080
of the president of Sunset Club.

682
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,160
Don't bother.

683
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,240
I can contact him myself.

684
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,680
I've already contacted them.

685
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,280
They allow

686
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,440
you to use the spare auditorium.

687
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,120
Really?

688
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,440
Yes.

689
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,760
Then I'll go to the auditorium now.

690
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,480
But you may not be able to get in now.

691
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Why?

692
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,440
Because Sunset Club

693
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
lost the key.

694
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,680
They said they'd let me know

695
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,520
if they found it.

696
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,280
Can they find it?

697
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,680
Maybe one day.

698
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,760
Maybe more than ten days.

699
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,800
To sum up,

700
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,680
hypothesis of rational man

701
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,560
is less adaptable

702
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,520
in modern society.

703
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,280
How long?

704
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,320
Three minutes and 26 seconds.

705
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,400
Not bad.

706
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,640
How many arguments do I have?

707
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,640
Three big arguments.

708
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,480
Five sub-arguments.

709
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,360
There are still two arguments that lack supporting evidence.

710
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,040
I did well.

711
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,040
I think we don't

712
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,200
wanna play with our phones.

713
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
After we calm down,

714
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,440
we get no less happiness from preparing for the debate

715
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,440
than watching dramas.

716
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,280
That's great.

717
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,120
We get through this

718
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
together.

719
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,400
Thank you, Nan Bei.

720
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,600
Thank you.

721
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,400
I'll buy something to drink.

722
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,080
What would you like to drink?

723
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,600
Lemon tea.

724
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,640
OK.

725
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,360
Qincai, let me explain.

726
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,960
I don't wanna hear it.

727
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,720
Qincai

728
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,760
Things are not

729
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,160
what you think.

730
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,600
I don't wanna hear it.

731
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,400
Qincai

732
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,640
Qincai, please don't go.

733
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,520
Be careful.

734
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,520
Qincai

735
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,640
Qincai

736
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,520
Qincai

737
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,960
Oh, my God.

738
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,920
Is it good?

739
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,360
Nan Bei, why are you here?

740
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,520
How could you cheat me?

741
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,360
Let me explain.

742
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,280
Explain what?

743
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,200
I don't wanna hear it.

744
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,720
You want.

745
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,960
I don't wanna hear it.

746
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,480
Hello, I'm here.

747
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,880
I see you.

748
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,440
Nan Bei

749
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,720
Nan Bei

750
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,920
Nan Bei

751
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,320
Nan Bei

752
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,720
Nan Bei

753
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
I knew

754
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,720
it was doomed love

755
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,080
the first day I met her.

756
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,440
Hello.

757
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,600
What's wrong with you?

758
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,600
I just had surgery on my heart.

759
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,600
The doctor said I was not allowed to exercise strenuously.

760
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,720
You're overdoing it.

761
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,200
Hello.

762
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,760
What's wrong with you?

763
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,120
I seem to be suffering from heatstroke.

764
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,640
Heatstroke?

765
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,080
I'm dizzy, thirsty and a little nauseous.

766
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,280
Nauseous?

767
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
You pretend well.

768
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,560
Next.

769
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,840
I'm coming.

770
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,120
What's wrong with you?

771
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,120
Miss

772
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,080
I fainted

773
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,040
when I was standing just now.

774
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,520
I'm dizzy,

775
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,800
thirsty

776
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,560
and a little nauseous.

777
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,240
Am I suffering from heatstroke?

778
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,800
21 pretenders

779
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,840
have come this morning.

780
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
You're the 22nd.

781
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,840
Ah.

782
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm the 22nd.

783
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,480
Miss

784
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,120
What's wrong with you?

785
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm dizzy, thirsty

786
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,040
and a little nauseous.

787
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,840
She's the 23rd.

788
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,400
It's no use

789
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,800
pretending to be ill.

790
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm really sick.

791
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,440
I'm really sick, too.

792
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,800
We are all really sick.

793
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
Do you know this?

794
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,960
Now I give you two choices,

795
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,840
either go out by yourself

796
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,240
or take your temperature

797
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,440
and send you to the class teacher.

798
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
Ah.

799
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,760
I'm well.

800
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,040
What are you doing?

801
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,360
I feel bad.

802
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,120
Let's stick to it.

803
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,520
I really feel bad.

804
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,200
Nothing is impossible

805
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
to a willing mind.

806
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,240
It's okay.

807
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,920
Let's do some trauma next time.

808
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,840
Trauma is realistic.

809
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,520
I really feel bad.

810
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,600
All right. You still pretend

811
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,760
after all this time?

812
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
But you pretend well.

813
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,040
I should learn from you.

814
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
I'll be like you next time.

815
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,520
Ah.

816
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,120
Ah.

817
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,200
Ah.

818
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,360
Are you all right?

819
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,160
Ah.

820
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,560
Ah.

821
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,720
Someone faints here.

822
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,440
Ah.

823
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,120
Ah.

824
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,040
Come around?

825
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,840
I take a small part of the blame

826
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,080
for letting you have an infusion.

827
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,640
But you,

828
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,200
as a contemporary woman,

829
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,800
should be brave enough

830
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,120
to express yourself.

831
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,200
How can you

832
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,880
stand behind me

833
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,840
so timidly?

834
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,520
Next time,

835
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
you should stand in front of me.

836
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,240
If you're sick, you must speak up.

837
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,440
Are you done?

838
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,360
I sacrificed myself

839
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,280
to get you to the infirmary

840
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,720
before you went into shock.

841
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,920
It was my fault to pretend to be sick before.

842
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,880
Let's call it even now.

843
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,200
You don't look

844
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,080
very clever,

845
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,360
and you talk so much.

846
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,280
You should debate

847
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,200
if you have this ability.

848
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,320
You should know that our university

849
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,040
has a debate team.

850
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,640
I'm Nan Bei,

851
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,600
the rising star

852
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,600
of the debate team of DUFE.

853
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,400
I'm Mu Xiaoyu,

854
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,280
the future of the debate team of DUFE.

855
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,560
Nan Bei

856
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
You come around.

857
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,680
That's ok.

858
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,240
I do think of some

859
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,240
old things.

860
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,600
You scared me.

861
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,200
Tao Hao, you come just in time.

862
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,080
I suspected

863
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,000
that Sunset Club

864
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,920
used the public resources of the university privately.

865
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,400
Now it's true.

866
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,160
I looked into it.

867
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,040
In the archives,

868
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
the president of Sunset Club

869
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,520
is Li Jinjiao,

870
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,400
and the member is Wang Yinjiao.

871
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,480
You made

872
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
all this up.

873
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,600
I initially wanted to call them

874
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,000
Benboerba and Baboerben.

875
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,840
I later gave up

876
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,240
when I thought they were easy to see through.

877
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,840
I won't report these

878
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,600
to the university for the time being.

879
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,600
I'll give you one day

880
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,800
to clean up this place.

881
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,280
One day?

882
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,240
Yes.

883
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,440
This workload is a bit heavy.

884
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
So I suggest

885
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,920
you clean it up

886
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,600
from now on.

887
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,400
Thank you, Ma Nan.

888
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,560
Would you like to?

889
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,600
I do.

890
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,240
What to do?

891
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,320
I don't even know

892
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,080
if Qincai is dead.

893
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,960
All right.

894
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,920
When the competition is over,

895
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,880
I'll watch the replay with you.

896
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,120
Excuse me.

897
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,840
Dango

898
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,080
Nan Bei and I have made up our minds

899
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,960
to delete Tik Tok and videos

900
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
from each other's phones.

901
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,880
Really?

902
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,000
Great.

903
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,040
I've also deleted Taobao.

904
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,560
Friends

905
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,680
There is a piece of wonderful news.

906
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,000
We can use

907
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,240
the spare auditorium for the competition.

908
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,280
Really?

909
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,960
Yes.

910
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,160
I know

911
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,040
anything can be done

912
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
with Hao.

913
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,640
We also successfully

914
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,080
quit cell phone dependence.

915
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,480
Really, friends?

916
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,880
The darkness has passed.

917
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,080
The dawn is not far away.

918
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,040
Let's forget about the pain

919
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
and prepare for the competition.

920
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,280
Let's go.

921
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,720
Let's go.

922
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,560
Dango, you're great.

923
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,880
You correct your shortcomings immediately.

924
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,560
Nan Bei and I

925
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,320
are not as good as you.

926
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,280
There's nothing I can do.

927
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,080
I can't keep buying.

928
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm also out of money.

929
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,520
It's better not to buy.

930
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,840
Save you regret it.

931
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,200
You can save money

932
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,920
by drinking fewer cups of milk tea.

933
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,760
Hello.

934
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,520
Ah.

935
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,120
These shoes are very popular.

936
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,200
Ah.

937
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,760
Not bad.

938
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,240
You also like sneakers?

939
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,120
Yes.

940
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,440
What brands and styles

941
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,040
do you like?

942
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,880
I can get them all.

943
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,960
But you have to add some money

944
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,880
for me to make money.

945
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,640
You wanna make money.

946
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,360
Why do you come here in line?

947
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,520
This pair of AJ is a replica version,

948
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,560
which is easy to depreciate.

949
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,560
And the main customers of this pair of shoes

950
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,760
are students.

951
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,560
They can wait a few more months.

952
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,120
They can wait until the shoes are 50% off and 30% off.

953
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,840
Apple next door launches new products today.

954
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,640
This is the rigid demand.

955
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Thanks.

956
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,080
Ah.

957
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,840
Hum.

958
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,280
Hello.

959
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
Why are you sighing?

960
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,920
Maybe what he wants is not a pair of shoes

961
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,520
but care.

962
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,840
For example,

963
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,160
you should cook noodles

964
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,960
for him who stays up late to review

965
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,960
late at night.

966
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,680
Oh.

967
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,840
I got it.

968
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,120
Thanks.

969
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,880
You're welcome.

970
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,520
I'll be right back.

971
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,040
You're welcome.

972
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,880
Hello.

973
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,640
What's wrong?

974
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,680
You like to play basketball, right?

975
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,160
Just so so.

976
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,120
Let me tell you

977
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,520
some of the most important things in life.

978
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,600
What?

979
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,840
Do you know

980
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,800
what Socrates said?

981
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,800
I don't know.

982
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,560
Know yourself.

983
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,720
Do you know

984
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,280
what Gustave Le Bon said?

985
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,880
I don't know.

986
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,200
Know the crowd.

987
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,880
I got it.

988
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,560
Thanks.

989
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
You're welcome.

990
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,280
Hello.

991
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,360
Hello.

992
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,560
I think you're a talent.

993
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,160
I'm flattered.

994
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,680
But now you have a problem.

995
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,480
What?

996
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,280
There are at least

997
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,760
170 people ahead.

998
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,840
There are still two hours before the sale.

999
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,040
In your way,

1000
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,200
even if you win one over in five minutes,

1001
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,560
you still can't buy it.

1002
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,680
So?

1003
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,400
I suggest we cooperate.

1004
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,240
Excuse me.

1005
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,200
I'm used to fighting alone.

1006
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,560
Then you convince me first.

1007
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,520
Right.

1008
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Deal.

1009
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,360
Ah.

1010
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,760
Hello.
