00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,200
Hello Debate Opponent 2
EP09

2
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,800
-I...  -Yu, Yu, Yu!

3
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,040
The photos of you and Nan Bei were exposed!

4
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,520
What photos of me and Nan Bei?

5
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Look.

6
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,560
Are they you and Nan Bei?

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,680
It's the hottest post on the BBS.

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,280
It's updated every day.

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,080
Danger!

10
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,280
Hey, hey, hey!

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,960
Okay. I admit it.

12
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,720
Sometimes,

13
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,320
I stole your

14
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
wet tissues to wipe my basketball.

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
No wonder my wet tissues usually twice a pack

16
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,000
are used up so quickly!

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,520
Wait.

18
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,200
I don't come here

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,960
for this!

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,000
Look!

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,920
Are, are they...

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,120
Yes!

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,440
But we're not...

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,240
No!

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,640
I...

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,480
What do you mean?

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,440
You also don't know this?

28
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
I... Of course not!

29
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm also one of the victims!

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
Are they blind?

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,760
How do we look like a couple?

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,840
Calm down.

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,160
Let's analyze it.

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Who is likely to play such a dirty trick to us?

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,480
Photographer.

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,000
Film editor.

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,440
Ah!

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Ah!

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,160
I didn't do it! Really!

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,000
Look at those photos

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,240
I took before!

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,200
The composition

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
and post-production of yours are not professional!

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,200
I, I'm professional!

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,280
What he said

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,360
seems to make sense.

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,000
Ouch.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
Hello, Manager.

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Hao

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Xixi asked for a leave.

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,000
She has

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
a contract of clients.

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,280
It's not finished.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,320
There are so many places to adjust.

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,920
You do it.

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,120
Well...

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,240
It will need at least one hour to adjust the contract.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,760
Maybe I'll skip the training.

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,240
No way.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
It's an argument today. I cannot skip it.

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,480
Okay?

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,560
Yes.

63
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,960
Okay.

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Yes.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,520
Jesus.

66
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,200
Are you

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
still mad at the post?

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,480
What's wrong with those people?

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,120
Why are there so many

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,800
likes and comments!

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,440
What the hell?

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,760
So sweet.

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,560
Go and get married.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,640
Opps! It's the feeling of heartbeat.

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,920
Nan Bei and me.

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
It's about Nan Bei and me.

77
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
How come do we look like a couple?

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,240
Do we look even close to

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,080
a couple?

80
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,840
Tell me where we look like a couple.

81
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Where?

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,320
I'll correct myself.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,720
Actually...

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:52,800
You...

85
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,640
Why did you also buy these pair of shoes?

86
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,440
Aren't they limited edition?

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,080
It is the limited edition activity.

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
I thought only I got these.

89
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,040
They've already been clichés.

90
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
You tied your shoelaces differently.

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,120
Why?

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,720
Let me tell you.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,280
If shoelaces are tied

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,160
in a plain way,

95
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,320
like hairstyles of a person,

96
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
it will be so strange when it doesn't match the person.

97
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
I have a new method to tie shoelaces.

98
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,960
Let me teach you.

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,680
It sounds great.

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,920
Honey. If you treat it in such a way,

101
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
every two can be a couple.

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,440
What are you eating?

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,000
Blueberry biscuits.

104
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
I made them by myself.

105
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,800
Do you want to have one?

106
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,400
Okay.

107
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,200
Ma Nan. Pass me the eraser.

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,920
Hmm.

109
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,520
What you said

110
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
does make sense.

111
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:51,920
See?

112
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,600
But there's

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,960
still no way we can do about it.

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
You should know

115
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,720
that you two

116
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
are undoubtedly

117
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,800
a real couple

118
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,960
for others.

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Rock Tea.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
As its name implies, where there's rock, there's tea.

121
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
Where there's no rock, there's no tea.

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
It tastes rich and mellow, and shows its quality in the water.

123
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,040
Besides, favor remains after people drink it.

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,600
Please.

125
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,080
Do you want to drink, Xiaoyu?

126
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,440
No.

127
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,760
How's that?

128
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,240
Brilliant!

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,760
You know,

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,320
you've really taken advantage of it.

131
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
The tea is 500 yuan per kilo.

132
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,160
Why don't you buy some

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,920
and taste it whenever you like?

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Bro

135
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,880
Aren't we here for the training?

136
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
You come here to sell things?

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,880
Drinking tea is to cultivate our mind

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,640
and get rid of distractions.

139
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,560
There's still one who's not here.

140
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,040
Where is Sister Tao Hao?

141
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,760
She said

142
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
she would be here soon.

143
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,040
Alright.

144
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
Wait for a while.

145
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,160
Sister Tao Hao

146
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,320
Hello.

147
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,120
Sorry. Sorry.

148
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,440
Hao

149
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,840
I'm late.

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Today's argument

151
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,080
should be free debating or grouping?

152
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,040
Grouping, grouping.

153
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
Every time we choose free debating,

154
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm always the one who is beaten!

155
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,280
Follow me.

156
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I'll help you.

157
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,600
Jesus Christ! I'll help you!

158
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,200
Okay.

159
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,080
I'll be in a group with Hao.

160
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Come on.

161
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,280
She fell asleep so fast.

162
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,200
She could fall asleep even if we were so noisy!

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
How tired she is!

164
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,240
It's normal.

165
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,040
Vice president of seven clubs.

166
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
Vice minister of three student departments.

167
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,120
It's already good that

168
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,040
she doesn't help the old coach.

169
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Let me have a look.

170
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,040
One, apply for the budget for clubs.

171
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,800
Two, reimburse for Mr. Li.

172
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,360
Three, the student union...

173
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,720
It's alright.

174
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,360
There are only five to-do-lists.

175
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,640
Although she's busier

176
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,880
than five of us,

177
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,240
I don't think she's terribly busy.

178
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,400
Let me have a look.

179
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,880
Oh, oh, oh.

180
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,000
I...

181
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,080
Fifty-six to-do-lists.

182
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Two of them are about you.

183
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
Help Nan Bei order the court.

184
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
Can't you order it yourself?

185
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,680
Help Nan Bei order

186
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,160
an stylish restaurant.

187
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,720
Why can't you browse DianPing?

188
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
Why...why do you need

189
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,920
an stylish restaurant?

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
Don't your parents run a braised chicken restaurant?

191
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,880
Wait a moment.

192
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,360
There are also lists about you.

193
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Xiaoyu's detergent powder.

194
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,160
Can't you buy it yourself?

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,880
Help Xiaoyu return books.

196
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,040
Mu Xiaoyu

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,320
I have to

198
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
educate you now.

199
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,440
You've been more than 50 kilograms.

200
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,520
How can't you return books?

201
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
Don't you have self-care ability?

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,880
No, I... I mean,

203
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,520
if you want to return books

204
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
that are too heavy for you,

205
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,200
I can help you.

206
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,640
Piss off.

207
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,040
Ma Nan

208
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
Why does she help you to give out leaflets?

209
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,840
For what?

210
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,080
I bought too much tea.

211
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,280
So I want to have a sale promotion.

212
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,520
Jesus! You!

213
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,880
Poor girl!

214
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
She's so tired!

215
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,400
Let us help her to handle some things.

216
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,160
You...

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,960
If you didn't wake up,

219
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,800
I would become paralyzed.

220
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,920
Hao

221
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,640
Wait for a while.

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm almost done.

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Xiaoyu, let me do it.

224
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,680
It's okay.

225
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,280
Hao

226
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,840
The application lists of clubs

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,760
have been finished for you.

228
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
Thank you. It's so kind of you.

229
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,680
I've been sleeping for so long!

230
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,160
The... the training today...

231
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
Don't worry, Hao.

232
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
We have already

233
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,440
finished our training.

234
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,560
Take a good rest today.

235
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,520
Give yourself a break.

236
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,480
Right.

237
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
Look how tired you are.

238
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,040
Take a rest from time to time.

239
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
Take a sun bath. Look at the sky.

240
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,880
Look how beautiful the sky is.

241
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,000
I've only worked for one afternoon,

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
but my back aches already.

243
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,120
Hao need deal with so many

244
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,960
things every day.

245
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,520
It's likely for her to get a cervical spondylopathy

246
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,600
or a slipped disc.

247
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,840
You clearly know

248
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,760
what kind of person she is.

249
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,720
Multi-tasker.

250
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,160
How could you say like that?

251
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,200
Hao doesn't know how to refuse others.

252
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,160
Do you think she is not busy?

253
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,920
She's not like you,

254
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,000
who looks so mean.

255
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,720
As a man, I...

256
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,840
Were it not

257
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,000
your bad temper,

258
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,400
how could I be so mean!

259
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Fight back against me!

260
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,480
I dare not do, but I dare think.

261
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
Come here. Come here.

262
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,680
Duck!

263
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,880
Duck!

264
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,320
Give it a name.

265
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,360
It seems inappropriate to

266
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,400
call it duck.

267
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,480
Right.

268
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,280
Call it...

269
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,360
Xiwang

270
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,840
Happiness and wealth.

271
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,160
It also means hope.

272
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,000
So good.

273
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,360
What an idiot!

274
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,360
Is he, duck?

275
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,280
Xiwang

276
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,800
Xiwang

277
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,400
I've added

278
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,280
the investigation result.

279
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,760
I'll send it to Mr. Li right away.

280
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,760
Alright.

281
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Don't worry.

282
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,400
Have fun with Nan Bei.

283
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,280
Hao

284
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,200
As to the expenditure

285
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,120
of each club,

286
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,000
you should specify

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,880
those who exceed the limit.

288
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,280
Okay. Okay.

289
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,040
I'll send it soon.

290
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,040
The document of traffic rules

291
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,280
of shuttle between campuses

292
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,840
should be scanned before the meeting.

293
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,520
Got it.

294
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:56,880
Hello.

295
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,280
Hao, are you busy?

296
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,800
No.

297
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,040
The client needs a

298
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
preliminary project scheme

299
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,840
in a haste.

300
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,600
Write it for me.

301
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,440
Alright.

302
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,120
I'll send it right away.

303
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,960
Wait.

304
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,920
Remember to send an e-mail to the client.

305
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
And send the document in the meeting

306
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,600
together.

307
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay. Right away.

308
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,600
Hello. Yes?

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,560
Hao

310
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,040
Have you finished doing the slides?

311
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,840
I've been busy since then. I forgot.

312
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,520
The teacher is pressing for it.

314
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,920
We should hand it in today.

315
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,040
If you are busy,

316
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,080
I'll do it myself.

317
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,320
Don't be angry.

318
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,520
I guarantee that I'll finish it tonight.

319
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
Well, alright.

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,560
Thank you.

321
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,360
I have other things to do now.

322
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,360
I'll call you later.

323
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,440
Okay.

324
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,080
Okay.

325
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,480
Hao

326
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,400
Why are you lying on the ground?

327
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,120
You can take a nap on the bed.

328
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm fine.

329
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,720
I was just doing exercise.

330
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Bad taste!

331
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,640
What a bad taste they have!

332
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,760
What are you looking at?

333
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,800
I...

334
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,000
You're insane!

335
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,720
You're insane!

336
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,360
Why do you always

337
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,600
stand behind others?

338
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,080
Did you see the campus post?

339
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,920
Fans are insane.

340
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,320
Let's post to clarify our relationship.

341
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,080
Come on.

342
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
In this kind of gossip,

343
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,440
do you think you can

344
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
depend on yourself to

345
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,520
change others' thought?

346
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,480
Then what should we do?

347
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,960
Leave it alone?

348
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,360
In my opinion,

349
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,840
if it's a misunderstanding

350
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,720
at the beginning,

351
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,680
just be more careful in the future.

352
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,560
Our campus is not that big.

353
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,960
As time passes by,

354
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,720
people will know

355
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,840
what on earth happened.

356
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,520
That's what I want to hear.

357
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,760
Being a team member with you

358
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,520
is the least thing

359
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,800
I'll do again in my life.

360
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
Look at it by yourself.

361
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
Do I owe you?

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
Like a ghost. Check it out.

363
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Look at it. Look. Look at it!

364
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,920
Number eight. What's the big deal?

365
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,320
Who cares?

366
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,560
Take it easy.

367
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,800
I'll go after fetching documents.

368
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,400
What do you mean?

369
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,320
We are all victims

370
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,040
of "the best couple" post.

371
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,320
Liu Yanze and I

372
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,080
are also

373
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,680
one of the couples they formed.

374
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,480
However, compared to you,

375
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,120
our condition is worse.

376
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,000
The rank of Liu Yanze and I

377
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
is always the first.

378
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,560
So annoying.

379
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,240
Is that an annoyed appearance?

380
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,200
You must enjoy it!

381
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,480
Are you

382
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,840
mad because

383
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,920
our ranking

384
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,160
is higher than yours?

385
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,000
Isn't it normal?

386
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,760
It's true.

387
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,800
The billboard

388
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,040
is updated every week

389
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,960
for revote.

390
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,120
They always rank the first every week.

391
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,720
Are...

392
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,480
you okay?

393
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,080
These are the latest

394
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,280
photos and videos of couples.

395
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,840
Wait.

396
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
If you continue to do it,

397
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,880
sooner or later,

398
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
you will be exposed.

399
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Mu Xiaoyu won't let you go.

400
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,400
You'll never know

401
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,480
how we CP fans feel.

402
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,880
Then,

403
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,480
wish you good luck.

404
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,560
Thanks for watching the weather forecast.

405
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,320
Smog continues to gather in our city,

406
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,760
having a negative effect on

407
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,480
the production and daily life of citizens.

408
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,040
Super smog gathering above our city

409
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,520
is predicted to

410
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
disperse tonight.

411
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,240
The sunny day expected

412
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
for so long is coming.

413
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,280
Excuse me.

414
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,960
Sorry. I know I'm wrong.

415
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't be mad at me!

416
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,320
If I watch a movie at my dormitory,

417
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,760
I can talk about the plot with my roommates.

418
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,040
But you just look at your phone.

419
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,040
We only come out once a week.

420
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,080
There are only three hours to

421
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,800
have dinner and watch a movie.

422
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,120
Don't tell me

423
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,880
you cannot even give me

424
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,680
three hours?

425
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,760
But my junior and her boyfriend

426
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,920
have been quarreling for so long.

427
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,600
She cries so sadly.

428
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,360
I cannot leave her alone.

429
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
What makes a difference

430
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,480
if you comfort her two hours later?

431
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
You always care about others'

432
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,240
relationship.

433
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,200
How about ours?

434
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,520
Sorry.

435
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:37,880
I may

436
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,360
be under great pressure during internship.

437
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,880
Don't have dinner this evening.

438
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,800
Why don't you have

439
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,120
Yao Shen instant noodles?

440
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,600
The last one

442
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
is bought by that lady.

443
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,760
Senior

444
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,840
What a coincidence!

445
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,800
You, you can eat mine.

446
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
I haven't eaten it.

447
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,240
Is it proper to eat yours?

448
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,080
It's okay.

449
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,160
Alright.

450
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,040
It would be better if there are pickles.

451
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,560
I know a kind of pickles

452
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,400
which tastes so good.

453
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,160
Senior

454
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
It would be better if there are sausages.

455
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,760
I'll buy it.

456
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,960
Try it, Senior.

457
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,240
Any drink?

458
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,720
Coke?

459
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,560
Senior

460
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,880
Hello, Manager.

461
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,000
Hao

462
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,120
Didn't I tell you

463
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
to send the email to the client before leaving work?

464
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,360
The client said he didn't receive it at the end of the day!

465
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,400
Sorry, Manager.

466
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,560
I was two minutes late.

467
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,280
But I've

468
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,520
apologized in the e-mail.

469
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,160
What's the point of apology?

470
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,320
Xixi asked for a leave these days.

471
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,040
There's only you who

472
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,880
can do these things.

473
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,920
Why did you do things

474
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
without consideration?

475
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,920
Manager, I...

476
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,760
What?

477
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,320
Remember:

478
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,280
Be serious

479
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,920
at work!

480
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,520
Sorry.

481
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,360
Give me some tissues.

482
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,600
Here you are.

483
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,440
I'll pay you later.

484
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,160
Here.

485
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,760
One day, when I walked home,

486
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,360
I came across a magic lamp.

487
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
I wiped it with a cloth,

488
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,800
and an elf popped out of it.

489
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,200
He told me that

490
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,800
he could grant me a wish.

491
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,160
Whatever I wanted.

492
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,960
However,

493
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,520
once your wish came true,

494
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,640
your enemy,

495
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
whom you hated most,

496
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,240
would get

497
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,080
the same twice as much.

498
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,480
Therefore,

499
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,000
I made a wish:

500
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,320
Every day in my life,

501
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
every day,

502
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,040
I can sleep for twelve hours.

503
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,080
How's that?

504
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,440
Is it great?

505
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,720
I've heard it before.

506
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,360
Oh.

507
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,920
I don't notice that you

508
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,080
have an internship outside.

509
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,160
My boyfriend's manager

510
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,760
is too busy.

511
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,000
I help him

512
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,360
to do part of the work.

513
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,480
So you have work at university,

514
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,680
in the debate team,

515
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,280
and you also

516
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
help your boyfriend to work.

517
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,640
Why?

518
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,440
When I was in Junior 3,

519
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,040
my sister was born.

520
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,040
I had to

521
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,400
make myself more thoughtful

522
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,240
and more obedient

523
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,480
to gain my parents' attention.

524
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,960
Hao, eat with us.

525
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,560
Dad, Mom. You eat first.

526
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,040
After she falls asleep,

527
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,280
I'll come to eat.

528
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
Because of my parents' jobs,

529
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,960
we often moved house.

530
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,480
Every time we moved,

531
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,280
I should get into

532
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,920
a new school to study.

533
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,160
As a transfer student,

534
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
I felt it hard to

535
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,600
integrate into the class.

536
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
I had no friends in the class.

537
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,320
Later...

538
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,040
Class is over.

539
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,760
Let's call it a day.

540
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,840
I'll go now.

541
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,600
Bye-bye.

542
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,280
Bye-bye.

543
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,920
Let's go home together.

544
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,400
But I'm on duty today.

545
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,440
You can go first.

546
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,360
I can help you.

547
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,520
You're so nice!

548
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,680
Let's do it.

549
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:44,920
Okay.

550
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,680
So from then on,

551
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,480
you started to gain attentions

552
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,000
by pleasing others.

553
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,000
Tao Hao

554
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,040
This is not right.

555
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,560
What should I do?

556
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,240
Correct it!

557
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,760
So, Tao Hao.

558
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,280
Your situation is very severe now.

559
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
In order not to affect

560
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,360
the routine of our team,

561
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,280
let's start to

562
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,920
train you now.

563
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,600
Okay.

564
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,120
Just tell me,

565
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,400
how to correct me?

566
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,440
From now on, refuse every request

567
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,600
that you want to refuse.

568
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,480
Oh.

569
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,680
Well...

570
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,600
Is it easy?

571
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,640
Of course.

572
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,840
Let's have a try.

573
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,440
Who'll go first?

574
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,600
I'll do!

575
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,160
Okay. You go first.

576
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,360
Hao

577
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,640
We'll clean our dormitory tomorrow.

578
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,440
You do it by yourself.

579
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,240
Okay.

580
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,200
What?

581
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,320
Dear me!

582
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,880
It doesn't work!

583
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,440
Our dormitory

584
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,200
is always cleaned up

585
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,840
by Hao.

586
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,440
Your turn.

587
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,680
Hao

588
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,440
I don't want to write for the first debater.

589
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
please help me.

590
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,360
When I searched for materials yesterday,

591
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
I've finished it.

592
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,760
What?

593
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,360
Hao

594
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,360
I was just joking!

595
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,000
You should refuse us!

596
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,520
Well,

597
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
because our friendship

598
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
is so good!

599
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,760
If it's from someone else, I may succeed.

600
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,680
Your solution doesn't work!

601
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,440
It's okay.

602
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I have faith in her.

603
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,440
I believe her.

604
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,120
Do you have any

605
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,360
problems of jobs next week?

606
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,520
No problem.

607
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,560
You didn't write anything.

608
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,480
Of course you have no problems!

609
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,600
I have a good memory.

610
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,080
Really?

611
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,200
Why haven't you graduated?

612
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,160
Sorry.

613
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,080
I'm late.

614
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,440
Hao. Take your time.

615
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,880
Take your time.

616
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
Well, Hao.

617
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,120
Did you finish the table

618
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,960
of club fees?

619
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,760
Yes.

620
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,200
Here it is.

621
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Have a look.

622
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,120
Have a look. Mr. Li.

623
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
These are the clarification of

624
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,760
cost overruns of three clubs,

625
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,800
and schedule

626
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,520
for the experimental shuttle

627
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,240
between campuses.

628
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,000
Please sign over there.

629
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,600
Okay. There are only two of them.

630
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,640
Oh.

631
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
This is the third one.

632
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,120
Hao. It's of the last year.

633
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,160
See? It has been signed.

634
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,160
Sorry.

635
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,480
I'll print it right now.

636
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
No, no, no. Thanks.

637
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,280
No need.

638
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,640
Oh, right.

639
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,600
Who'd like to send the document

640
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
to the School of Management?

641
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,800
I'll do it. Mr. Li.

642
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,480
You need to take a rest.

643
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
You send it for me after a while.

644
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:29,880
Okay?

645
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,840
Thank you, Mr. Li.

646
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,400
Okay. I won't bother you now.

647
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,040
I'll go for a meeting.

648
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,200
Nailed it.

649
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,360
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

650
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,600
Hello.

651
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,000
Watch a movie?

652
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,680
But I'm busy in the student union this afternoon.

653
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,080
How about this evening?

654
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,880
The last movie is in this afternoon.

655
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,760
Alright.

656
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,000
Hao

657
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,000
Could you please

658
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,720
help me to send the document

659
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,680
to the School of Management?

660
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,120
Okay.

661
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,640
Thank you, Hao!

662
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,240
Hey.

663
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,880
I'll go with you.

664
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,080
And I'll bring you to a place.

665
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:26,880
Okay.

666
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,520
No matter

667
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,880
how hard he plays,

668
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,840
or how good he plays,

669
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,680
don't give him a penny.

670
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,480
You'll win if you listen to five songs.

671
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,200
This song is for my dad

672
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,920
who's ill abed.

673
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,680
Hold it.

674
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,680
The next song is for my sister

675
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,680
who is born

676
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
to have a harelip.

677
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,960
Hum?

678
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,200
What's that?

679
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,320
I, I really don't know it.

680
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
I didn't know why it just came out...

681
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,360
Take it back.

682
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,320
Fine. Give it to him.

683
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,160
I...

684
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,040
Do you have QR code?

685
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,800
Yes.

686
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,200
♪ I've been racing with youth ♪

687
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,520
♪ Every second is good ♪

688
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,720
♪ This one-direction track ♪

689
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,840
♪ is full of gunpowder ♪

690
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,600
Right now,

691
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,440
the debating room belongs to them.

692
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,160
Who knows if

693
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,960
they'll come?

694
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,240
Not here.

695
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,880
Wow! How dare they changed the lock!

696
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,120
Despicable! Dirty! Rascally!

697
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,240
Did you unlock it

698
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,200
in a wrong way?

699
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,000
Let me try.

700
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,800
They did change it!

701
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,600
Filthy! Disgusting! Bastard!

702
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,200
Right!

703
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,280
Whatever.

704
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,280
It's not an electric lock.

705
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,680
Get out of the way.

706
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,120
Hurry up.

707
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,760
I...

708
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,800
I...

709
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:23,920
Do I need to ask the guard

710
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,320
to look at this?

711
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,360
Yin Nan, Yin Nan.

712
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
You are what you're called!

713
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,240
You're sinister and cunning!

714
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,200
Tell me why you changed the lock.

715
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,320
We also need to use the classroom!

716
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,440
Haven't you learned

717
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,360
the knowledge of

718
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,560
fire alarm and security in our university?

719
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,160
We're also a debate team.

720
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,960
Don't go too far.

721
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,600
Forget it. Forget it.

722
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,440
Not worth it. Not worth it.

723
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,840
As for the final interpretation right,

724
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,600
I've made it clear.

725
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,160
If you don't understand it,

726
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,160
ask the one beside you

727
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,480
who learns the law as a dabbler.

728
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,840
Who's the dabbler!

729
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,240
Not worth it. Not worth it.

730
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,240
Not worth it. Not worth it.

731
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,600
Not worth it. Not worth it. Not worth it.

732
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Not worth it. Not worth it.

733
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,560
Not worth it. Not worth it.

734
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,240
Can I be happy by watching it?

735
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,920
Could you throw

736
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,480
your own phone next time?

737
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,640
Sa has been teaching us:

738
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,320
Don't be angry.

739
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Don't be angry.

740
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,440
Life is like a game.

741
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
I've heard you just picked a lock.

742
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
I finally know that

743
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,840
you study the law

744
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,480
to be on the edge of breaking the law.

745
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,160
Does it work?

746
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,760
Maybe.

747
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,960
Hello, Dango.

748
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,280
Hello, Xiaoyu.

749
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,800
I have a meeting in the comic club.

750
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,560
I cannot make it there.

751
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,880
Don't forget Hao's

752
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,080
birthday cake.

753
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,120
It depends on you and Nan Bei.

754
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I see. I see. I see.

755
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,320
Go ahead.

756
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,680
Alright.

757
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,720
Hurry up. Nan Bei.

758
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,640
We should prepare...

759
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,480
Where's the dessert I left here?

760
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,200
I'll throw it up for you.

761
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,080
Here you are.

762
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,120
Thank you.

763
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,600
Thank you for your company.

764
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,560
It's on me.

765
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:32,880
Okay.

766
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,160
Hello.

767
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,360
I need two strawberry ice creams.

768
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,960
Okay. Eighteen yuan in total.

769
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,680
Isn't it 12 yuan for each?

770
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,520
Did you make it wrong?

771
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,080
Our store has a discount today.

772
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,640
Half price for the second for couples.

773
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,600
Well, we're not a couple.

774
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,880
Not yet?

775
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,800
Have you bought them?

776
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,040
Right away.

777
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,560
I'll look for seats.

778
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,240
Okay.

779
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,800
Consider the couple discount.

780
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,200
Senior

781
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,400
Did you watch a movie

782
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,840
released lately

783
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,200
called "There is a Wood in the North"?

784
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,400
Nope.

785
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,600
Several days ago, my boyfriend

786
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,280
brought me to watch it.

787
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,080
It's good.

788
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,120
Oh.

789
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,400
The downstairs of the cinema

790
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,440
is a Hong Kong style cafe.

791
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,080
After watching the movie,

792
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,560
my boyfriend had dinner with me there.

793
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,480
Oh.

794
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,520
What's the matter?

795
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,600
I'm fine.

796
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,440
I, Senior, I...

797
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,480
My boyfriend is called Shi Jinxian.

798
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
What do I care?

799
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,200
Oh.

800
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,400
Just chatting.

801
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,080
Hello. Do you have an order?

802
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,440
Yes.

803
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,640
Dumb Mu.

804
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,560
Wait a moment.

805
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Miss Mu, right?

806
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
Please sign over here.

807
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,160
Okay.

808
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,800
Thank you.

809
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,160
You're welcome.

810
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,200
Are you going to make it alone

811
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,120
or by both of you?

812
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,120
Make, make what?

813
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,320
DIY cake means

814
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,840
making the cake yourself.

815
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,440
Wait me for a while.

816
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,880
If you cannot

817
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,280
explain it to me why we should

818
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,160
make the cake by both of us

819
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,960
with one sentence,

820
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,960
the thing that will be baked

821
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,880
will be your head.

822
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,480
Slow down. Slow down.

823
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,440
Smoke ahead.

824
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,320
There must be four of them.

825
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,280
Got it. Got it.

826
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,760
Come on.

827
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
Get on the car. Circle shrank.

828
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,720
Wait! I haven't got on the car!

829
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,920
-Hurry up!  -Wait for me!

830
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
Wait for me. Wait for me.

831
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Hurry up, bro!

832
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,600
Come on. Get on the car.

833
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,640
Wait me for a while.

834
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,680
Hurry up.

835
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,480
No way. I can't handle it.

836
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,040
Hurry up.

837
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,440
Right away. Right away!

838
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,600
I come back.

839
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,920
Wait a minute.

840
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,880
Let, let me ask you:

841
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,920
How does Hao treat us?

842
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,000
Good.

843
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,680
Hao

844
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,560
treats us so well.

845
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,240
Today is her birthday.

846
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,680
So we shouldn't

847
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,360
find a cake that is

848
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,200
so common

849
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,320
on the rack to her,

850
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,880
right?

851
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,960
Yes.

852
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,480
So,

853
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,280
how can we find a way that is

854
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,760
original,

855
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,120
ingenious,

856
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,840
and meaningful?

857
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,920
We must

858
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,640
make a cake by ourselves.

859
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,040
Am I right?

860
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,320
Do you know how to make it?

861
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,760
Do I

862
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,000
do things without preparation?

863
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,360
This rough style...

864
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,960
Excuse me.

865
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,120
Let a baker teach us.

866
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,640
The red light lasts for such a long time.

867
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,480
The setting time of traffic lights

868
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,080
depends on vehicle volume.

869
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
It's a four-lane double way.

870
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,840
There are universities around it.

871
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,920
So, it should be over two minutes.

872
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,200
There are still two minutes left?

873
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,480
Right.

874
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Only less than one minute is passed.

875
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,240
As long as two people

876
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,480
have a tacit mutual understanding,

877
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,520
they can shut up

878
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,600
and enjoy a moment of silence.

879
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,280
Aren't you embarrassed?

880
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,080
Of course I am.

881
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,040
But embarrassment is normal.

882
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,800
You need to get used to it.

883
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,680
By the way,

884
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,680
it's you who are more embarrassed.

885
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,160
Tao Hao

886
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,240
Senior

887
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,680
You're good-looking.

888
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
But I have no interest in you.

889
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,200
Why?

890
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,160
No.

891
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,640
Thank you.

892
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,200
I'm the one who likes freedom.

893
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,360
Relationship for me

894
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,760
is too troublesome.

895
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,680
If I have to find one, I'll find a wife.

896
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,120
If you were

897
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,560
the one as my wife,

898
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,760
I couldn't imagine

899
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,600
how boring it would be

900
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,840
of my life after marriage.

901
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
S...Senior

902
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,520
You've already elaborated your opinion.

903
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,880
I know what you mean.

904
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,880
I noticed that

905
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,120
you were a little bit nervous

906
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,440
from the ice cream store.

907
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,920
I just want to clarify it.

908
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,320
I think

909
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,080
you and I are alone,

910
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,680
so it's not appropriate

911
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,040
to be noticed on the street.

912
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,920
There are so many people.

913
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,280
Who cares about you?

914
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,480
Senior, you don't know it.

915
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,720
My boyfriend

916
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,560
often brought me

917
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,600
to go shopping on the street.

918
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,480
We also often ate

919
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,520
in the hotpot restaurant.

920
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,040
Every time, we would

921
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,000
sit at that place...
