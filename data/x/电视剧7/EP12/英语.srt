Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP12

2
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,920
How about we start now?

3
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,760
So many people haven't come yet.

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
How can we start?

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,040
How about you ask Dango,

6
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,760
where she is?

7
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,640
Nobody answered.

8
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
She must've gone somewhere

9
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,920
to eat delicious food.

10
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,960
Senior

11
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,960
You asked me to meet you in the classroom in the evening.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
What do you want to do?

13
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,520
What's this?

14
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,840
Open it and you'll know.

15
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
Low gluten flour 100g,

16
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
Tender tofu 50g,

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,720
and eggs.

18
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,200
This...

19
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,120
According to my taste last time

20
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,000
and recipe for butter cookies

21
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,560
from the Internet,

22
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,200
I wrote this.

23
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,520
But,

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
I can't make

25
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
what you made before.

26
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Senior

27
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,800
Do you really think

28
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,800
that making desserts

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,080
is so simple?

30
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
There're many cooking recipes

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
in the world.

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,840
Following the cooking recipes,

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,200
everyone can make food.

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
But,

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,560
the perfect proportion and purity

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,960
can only be made

37
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,760
by me.

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,280
First of all,

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,160
you should be familiar with the "temper" of your oven.

40
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,400
Does an oven have a "temper"?

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,680
Yes.

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,040
You should know

43
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
whether its temperature is high

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,320
or low.

45
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,960
So first,

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,640
you should prepare a thermometer.

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Learning is endless.

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
Can you please teach me?

49
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,320
Yes.

50
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,480
Look.

51
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,440
Look here.

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,160
You should sift the flour before you use it.

53
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
You should sift it

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,320
twice.

55
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,680
Hao

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,960
I have to hand in my paper

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,560
tomorrow

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,800
Or I'll fail.

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,480
You're good at writing and meticulous.

60
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,600
Please help me.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,880
Don't worry.

62
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
It's going to be fine.

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,400
OK.

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
Then I'll get you a glass of water.

65
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,560
Thank you.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,520
Senior Ma Nan

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,280
Someone asked me for help again.

68
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,840
So can I

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,440
go training later?

70
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
Why

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,560
did you ask me? What's wrong with you?

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,040
You've been helping me seriously.

73
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
But it's an emergency.

74
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,760
I can't refuse her.

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,640
So,

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,280
at least I can let you know it.

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,080
What's more,

78
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,600
on my birthday,

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
you didn't give me a gift.

80
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Can this request be

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
my gift?

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Okay.

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,720
So I'll go first.

84
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,360
I'll go there as long as I finish this.

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,600
Please

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
tell Xiaoyu and others.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,560
Thank you, senior Ma.

88
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,600
Hello.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

90
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,760
What's wrong with them?

91
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,920
Why didn't they answer the phone?

92
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,240
No one answered the phone.

93
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,840
Let me ask Ma Nan.

94
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
Hello, what are you doing?

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,320
Why aren't you here now?

96
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,280
We were here long ago.

97
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm playing computer game.

98
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
I'll go back after this game.

99
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,280
Don't worry.

100
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,640
OK.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,440
Hello?

102
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,240
Help!

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,640
You're the only one who can help me.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
Ma Nan is playing computer game again.

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,720
You can't rely on Ma Nan.

106
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
The students are late.

107
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,520
Why is Sa

108
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,400
also late?

109
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,120
I'll ask him.

110
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,480
Hello, Nan Bei,

111
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
I've got an emergency.

112
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,000
So I have to be there a bit late.

113
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,400
OK.

114
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,800
Bye.

115
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,080
Pull your arm harder.

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,920
It hurts.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,400
It hurts.

118
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,120
I came here to help you.

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,760
But my arm is stuck in it now.

120
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,800
What a disgrace!

121
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,360
Let's be more tacit.

122
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,800
About this,

123
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,760
let's make it a secret, okay?

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
Why are you so stupid?

125
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,520
You came here to help me.

126
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
But your arm is stuck now.

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,240
My great name!

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,880
Oh my god!

129
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Wait a moment.

130
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,120
What?

131
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Why are you holding my hand?

132
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm not holding your hand.

133
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
It's you who are holding my hand.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
And when you breathe,

135
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,520
please stay away from me.

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,000
Your breath,

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,600
I can feel it now.

138
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,080
Do you think I want to do that?

139
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,680
Two...four stars are shining in the sky.

140
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,360
Three stars are shining in the sky

141
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,680
Four...

142
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,440
She is gone.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,560
I'm on my knees.

144
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,080
Can you be politer?

145
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,120
Thank you.

146
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,880
You're welcome.

147
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,440
We're just here for training.

148
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,200
Why so many troubles?

149
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,400
It's all team one's fault.

150
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,520
Do you regret coming to team two?

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,040
Regret?

152
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,640
Yes.

153
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,080
I mean, do you regret coming to team two?

154
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
We didn't expect before we came to team two

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
that we would be terribly bullied

156
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,480
by team one.

157
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,200
We don't even have a place for training.

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
Heaven invests a person with great responsibilities.

159
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
It's just beginning.

160
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
And I told you before

161
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,280
that I would follow you.

162
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,920
I mean,

163
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,240
I will

164
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
accompany you to the championship.

165
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,840
You still remember that.

166
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,920
Of course.

167
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,760
Don't worry.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,120
It will come soon.

169
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,960
Nan Bei, Xiaoyu, I'm sorry.

170
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,160
Why are you so late?

171
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,280
Xiaoyu, let me tell you.

172
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,640
There is

173
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,400
something that makes me happy today.

174
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:29,840
Wait a moment.

175
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,440
Sir, I'll pay the bill.

176
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,040
How much is it?

177
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,520
It's paid.

178
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,000
What?

179
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,360
OK.

180
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,080
Where have you been in the morning?

181
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,880
I haven't seen you.

182
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
Good news!

183
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
I borrowed a car from the school.

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,080
The car will pick you up later.

185
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,960
So you don't have to take the subway anymore.

186
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,880
Good, Mr. Sa.

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,520
Not bad.

188
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,600
Yeah.

189
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,440
But we do need

190
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
to find another place.

191
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,800
Changing places every day

192
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,600
is not a good choice.

193
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:48,920
Yes.

194
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,360
Boys and girls

195
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,240
have to crowd in one room.

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,520
It's inappropriate.

197
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,320
Yes.

198
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
The point is

199
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,400
that the bathtub is so hard.

200
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,720
Here you are.

201
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:54,960
It's done.

202
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,840
Thank you.

203
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,640
-You're welcome.  -Thanks.

204
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,120
Let's go.

205
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,680
You choose "old friends are better than new ones".

206
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,400
I can understand.

207
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,280
Because you're afraid

208
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,880
that your old friends'

209
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,120
choices would be different from those of yours.

210
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,040
But we can see

211
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,880
that under the cover of

212
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,000
the pitiful appearance,

213
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,720
there is our selfishness to old friends

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,760
and our fear to make new friends.

215
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,160
So, on the pretext of morality

216
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,040
and love,

217
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,360
we kidnap the friendships.

218
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,880
Thank you.

219
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,800
The winner is

220
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,720
debate team two three five of positive side.

221
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,880
Congratulations!

222
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,280
What time is it now?

223
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Ma Nan

224
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,040
It's 8:30.

225
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
I remember that

226
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,000
we have class at nine o'clock.

227
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,680
How long will it take us to get back?

228
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,800
More than 40 minutes.

229
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,440
I think that skipping class once in a while is okay.

230
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,640
Look at you.

231
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,680
It's Mr. Li's class.

232
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
Mr. Li isn't here.

233
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,200
Are you looking for me?

234
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,960
What's wrong?

235
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,000
I see the ceiling twirling.

236
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,000
Are you OK?

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,560
Let's go to the hospital.

238
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,520
Or the school clinic, let's go.

239
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,560
No, I want to keep on learning.

240
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,760
OK.

241
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,360
You're pretending.

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,720
Keep on pretending?

243
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,080
Come to my office after class.

244
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,120
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
What are you doing?

246
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,120
Sit down.

247
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
OK, everyone.

248
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Today, we'll talk about

249
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
"Situation and Policy".

250
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,560
Please turn to

251
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,120
page 131

252
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,680
and see low-carbon economy.

253
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,840
Where are we going to train tonight?

254
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,920
What?

255
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
Where are we going to train tonight?

256
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,800
Train you?

257
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,600
I didn't mean that.

258
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
I say, where are we going to train?

259
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
We go to train.

260
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,080
We can go anywhere.

261
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,000
Coal,

262
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,960
oil, etc.

263
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
High carbon energy consumption.

264
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,480
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions

265
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,560
to...

266
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,160
Let's change our seats.

267
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,240
Thank you.

268
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,720
Thanks a lot.

269
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,920
Economic development situation.

270
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,320
Sir

271
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:58,920
What?

272
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
How do you sell the milk?

273
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,280
Today we have a special offer.

274
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,160
You can enjoy a discount after you apply for a card.

275
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,360
You only need to spend ten yuan a day.

276
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,680
If you order milk for more than seven days,

277
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
you could enjoy 10% discount.

278
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,520
And we will send it to your dorm.

279
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
This milk is very nutritious.

280
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,280
It's airlifted

281
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,360
from Ordos.

282
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,920
OK.

283
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,640
I'll order it for a month.

284
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,720
A month.

285
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,400
OK.

286
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,760
Let me calculate the price for you.

287
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,840
Do you need calculation?

288
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,760
I need to pay ten yuan every day.

289
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
There are seven days a week,

290
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,880
and four weeks a month.

291
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,880
And I also have 10% discount.

292
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,400
So I need to pay 250 yuan.

293
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,360
You don't need calculation anymore.

294
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,240
Do you pay with WeChat or Alipay?

295
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,520
WeChat.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
OK.

297
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,080
Senior Ma Nan

298
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,360
Are you ordering the milk?

299
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,520
No, I'll sell it to Mengyuan.

300
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,720
So,

301
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,520
are you going to work for Mr. Li again?

302
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,440
I'm going to borrow a classroom from him.

303
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
You're confident.

304
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,440
I was not confident at all.

305
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
But I'm confident as soon as I see you.

306
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,240
Why do I have

307
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,440
an unlucky premonition?

308
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,160
I was planning to meet him myself.

309
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,360
And I had no confidence.

310
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
But if you go with me,

311
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,080
the chances of success would be much bigger.

312
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't want to go.

313
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm busy.

314
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,560
Sir

315
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,680
How about we calculate

316
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,720
the price of milk he just ordered again?

317
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,600
Let's go to find Mr. Li.

318
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Goodbye.

319
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,800
Come again.

320
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,880
I don't have a classroom to lend you.

321
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,320
What's more,

322
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,880
is there anything

323
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,760
that stumps you?

324
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,400
I agree.

325
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,560
Do you need the teacher's help

326
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,400
with this kind of trifles?

327
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
To compete with team one,

328
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
you directly withdrew from the school team.

329
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,320
Where are your

330
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
spirits now?

331
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,480
Mr. Li

332
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,000
After all,

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,320
this classroom was the school's arrangement.

334
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,040
We have done

335
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,800
whatever we can do.

336
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,560
But we have no other solutions.

337
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
But now you belong to

338
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,480
the society team.

339
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
You can't

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,040
occupy the school resources.

341
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,840
Yes.

342
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,960
Isn't it cool under the overpass?

343
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,160
Isn't the steam room clean?

344
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,800
Isn't the sports field wide?

345
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,280
Who has given you the courage

346
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,720
to start an uprising here?

347
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,160
Am I right, Mr. Li?

348
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,520
Shut up.

349
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,600
Mr. Li

350
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,840
We signed up

351
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,360
for dozens of competitions.

352
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,960
We're facing with intensive schedules and heavy tasks.

353
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,480
We do need

354
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,880
a classroom for training.

355
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,840
We don't have blood ties with Mr. Li.

356
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,760
So we have to

357
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,720
obey the rules set by the school.

358
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,200
Why can't you understand?

359
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,080
In addition,

360
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,880
perhaps we would

361
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
be cut off from the famous competitions

362
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,240
and have to attend those

363
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,640
obscure ones.

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
So don't haggle over.

365
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,840
These are all our experiences.

366
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,600
Am I right, Mr. Li?

367
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,200
I said this for you.

368
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,920
I'm on your side.

369
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,400
Come to sit here quickly.

370
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm on your side.

371
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,680
What are you doing?

372
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,480
All the details of the club classrooms

373
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,080
are here.

374
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
You two,

375
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,680
help yourself.

376
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,080
Thank you, Mr. Li.

377
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,840
Thank you, Mr. Li.

378
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,960
Actuarial Science Club, Chess Club and Singing Club

379
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,160
are clubs

380
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,800
that have won awards in the city.

381
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,600
So they will not

382
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,160
give us their classrooms.

383
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
Basketball Club and Tai Chi Club

384
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,840
are outdoor activities.

385
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,880
So they don't have classrooms.

386
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,320
Look.

387
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,440
Foodie Union.

388
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,880
Why does Foodie Union

389
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,280
need a classroom?

390
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,920
Don't they just eat out?

391
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,040
Chinese Traditional

392
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,400
Dominoes Skill Game Research Association.

393
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,920
Don't they play mahjong together?

394
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,000
Why do they need a classroom to play mahjong?

395
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,560
Those kinds of obscure clubs

396
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,840
even don't have enough members.

397
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,040
So it's possible for them

398
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,240
to share classrooms with us.

399
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,600
That sounds right.

400
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,520
Let's split up.

401
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,080
OK.

402
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,960
Let's go.

403
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,880
Is that true?

404
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,480
Can we

405
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,360
share a classroom together?

406
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,520
Welcome.

407
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,320
We have

408
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,400
a big classroom.

409
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,840
So help yourself.

410
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,520
Thank you.

411
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,600
We are pretty experienced.

412
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,120
So don't worry.

413
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,560
See you.

414
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,920
Welcome to Biology Club.

415
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,880
Wow!

416
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,440
Oh my!

417
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,280
What's wrong with them?

418
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,720
Girls haven't come to our dorm for a long time.

419
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,680
So they need to clear up.

420
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,680
Oh, they don't have to do that.

421
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,560
We just came

422
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,360
to find a place for training.

423
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,760
Welcome to boys' dorm 213.

424
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,560
Why don't you enter the dorm?

425
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
They're better to go in to feel it first.

426
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,640
The boys' dormitory

427
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,760
stinks.

428
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,480
Now, I think

429
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,680
that leave the boys' dorm,

430
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,160
I can feel Maldives everywhere.

431
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm used to it.

432
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,000
How can it be so exaggerated?

433
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,560
I've sprayed half a bottle

434
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,720
of air freshener.

435
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,280
Or,

436
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
how about we go to the girls' dorm?

437
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,080
OK.

438
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
If you can come in our dorm, that would be okay.

439
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,080
Aunt, what did you have

440
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,920
for lunch today?

441
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,000
Did the food in the canteen taste good?

442
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,680
Aunt, this is the dance I just learned today.

443
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,160
Is it good?

444
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
It smells great.

445
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,440
Go in.

446
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,680
You go in.

447
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,960
You go first.

448
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,360
What are you doing here?

449
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,400
Come in.

450
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,520
Come in.

451
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:18,840
Have a seat please.

452
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,800
Please grab a seat.

453
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,040
My feet are not well.

454
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,880
My waist is ached.

455
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh my neck!

456
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,160
What are you going to do?

457
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,720
You're leaving as soon as you came in.

458
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,560
And,

459
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,880
My dormitory is a little shabby.

460
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,000
Please don't mind.

461
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,160
You allowed

462
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,120
to let us train here.

463
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,160
We appreciated it a lot.

464
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,720
Come in please.

465
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,480
Please come in.

466
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,920
Help yourself.

467
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,080
So,

468
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
everybody find a place to sit.

469
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,560
Where can we sit?

470
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,080
Hey.

471
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,200
You.

472
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,320
Which muscle are you working on?

473
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,400
Wow!

474
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,160
It's a famous brand.

475
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,160
Jingwen gave it to me.

476
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Did you hook up with her?

477
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,920
Why did she

478
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,400
give you such expensive clothes?

479
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
I wanted to confess to her.

480
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,680
Jingwen

481
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,120
Yes.

482
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,360
What?

483
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,880
The season is going to change soon.

484
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,760
I want to buy a coat.

485
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,360
So do you have a favorite one?

486
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,040
Let me see if it suits you.

487
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,960
No.

488
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,760
I like this.

489
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,080
It's nice.

490
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,040
Jingwen

491
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,280
Can you lend me

492
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
1500 yuan?

493
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,080
What's wrong with you?

494
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,920
You wanted to confess to her.

495
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,480
But you borrowed money from her

496
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,280
to buy a coat.

497
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,520
Why didn't you borrow money from me?

498
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,600
I borrowed money from her

499
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,920
because I wanted to confess to her.

500
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,320
What?

501
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,320
You know,

502
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,720
I borrowed 1500 yuan

503
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,360
from her to buy a coat.

504
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,200
I could pay it back over 15 years.

505
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,600
I could pay back 100 yuan a year,

506
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,200
8.3 yuan a month

507
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,600
and 27 cent a day.

508
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,720
So I could

509
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,880
give her a red envelope every day.

510
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,160
I could give her 13 cents in the morning

511
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,480
and 14 cents in the afternoon.

512
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,360
So I could confess to her by the implied meaning of numbers every day.

513
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,240
Are you a student of science?

514
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,440
How do you know

515
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,720
that I studied science in high school.

516
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,520
What happened to this coat?

517
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,040
Coat...

518
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,600
I don't know what happened.

519
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,600
When we

520
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,720
were eating,

521
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,000
she went out for a while.

522
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,240
When she came back,

523
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,120
she gave me this coat.

524
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,840
She is a good girl.

525
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
Look at her, she looked out for you.

526
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,600
She didn't want you to be embarrassed when you pay the bill.

527
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,880
But borrowing money from her

528
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,040
was not my original intention.

529
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,480
Let's forget it.

530
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,200
Let me ask you,

531
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,400
well,

532
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,920
when did you find out

533
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,160
that you like Jingwen?

534
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,520
When I first

535
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,440
saw her,

536
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,120
I could hear

537
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
hear our exclusive BGM

538
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,560
in my head.

539
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,280
Each couple

540
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,040
has their exclusive

541
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,680
BGM.

542
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,080
Is that true?

543
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

544
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,920
Don't you and Xiaoyu have one?

545
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,800
No.

546
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,920
How could you know that?

547
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,680
Bro

548
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,480
Things between you and Xiaoyu

549
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,640
seem remain unknown

550
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,800
only to you and her.

551
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,240
Is it so obvious?

552
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,720
Anyway, anyone with eyes

553
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,520
can see it.

554
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,480
Here is your take-out.

555
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,360
Shui

556
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,640
We didn't order the bar takeout.

557
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
Xiaoyang's guitar is broken.

558
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,600
I want to buy a new one.

559
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,680
So I took a part-time job.

560
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm leaving.

561
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,040
Please give me a five-star review.

562
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
No problem.

563
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,760
But,

564
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,240
do you know

565
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,640
where the training classrooms are in our school?

566
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,920
The classrooms have to be empty, not engaged

567
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,320
and accessible.

568
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,000
Backing one step to say,

569
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,080
a place where can keep out the wind and rain.

570
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,000
That's easy.

571
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,360
You can go to the attic of teaching building three.

572
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,320
Hey.

573
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,000
Make it clear.

574
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,080
That attic often stores

575
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,920
unclaimed express.

576
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,280
You can play cards,

577
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,800
have a rest

578
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,200
and even have a party there, no one will bother you.

579
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,320
Wait.

580
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,720
It stinks.

581
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,640
Be careful.

582
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,560
Look out!

583
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Xiaoyu, be cautious.

584
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,760
My job is done.

585
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,040
Enjoy yourself.

586
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,760
I'll leave.

587
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,600
You are so ungrateful.

588
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,480
It's changed a lot here.

589
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,400
Oh.

590
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,640
As the saying goes, the desolating gale freezes Yi River.

591
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,720
Pooh!

592
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,960
Your words are ominous.

593
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,200
Do you have that feeling?

594
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,920
We are like

595
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,720
ancient celebrities and heroes

596
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
who were forced to be bandits on the mountains.

597
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,520
So do you want to be a bandit?

598
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
What kind of bandits do you want to be?

599
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,080
That is "have my wish succeeded".

600
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,600
and "free as a cloud".

601
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,680
I declare

602
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,720
this is

603
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,840
our future base.

604
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,800
From now on...

605
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
From now on...

606
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,400
Let's clean the room first.

607
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,200
I always feel something missing.

608
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,240
Get it.

609
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,400
That's only an electronic lock.

610
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
It can't beat me.

611
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,160
I have many friends in the computer department.

612
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,160
Hey!

613
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,560
Hey!

614
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,240
What are you...

615
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,240
What are you doing?

616
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,840
I'm feeling it.

617
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,440
Hey!

618
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,680
Is your bag big enough?

619
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200
It's very big.

620
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,440
Western University of Science and Technology.

621
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,800
Western University of Science and Technology.

622
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,840
Why are there only their trophies?

623
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,040
What did I tell you before?

624
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,360
No.

625
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,960
I remember we have won many trophies.

626
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,240
Yeah!

627
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,440
Eureka!

628
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,160
I have no impression of it.

629
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,280
I have.

630
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,640
I won it five years ago.

631
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,240
Great.

632
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,800
Did they hide our trophies?

633
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,440
Hey.

634
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,400
I found your certificate of merit.

635
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,200
"The best debater of the chicken hot pot in Wutong road".

636
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,880
Yeah.

637
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,760
Great.

638
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,760
Why are you staring at me?

639
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,120
I did not.

640
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,280
Yes, you did.

641
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,440
You were laughing while you were looking at me.

642
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,760
That was weird.

643
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,520
I just think...

644
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,280
I just think

645
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,720
that the soybean milk should be delicious.

646
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,920
It's so hot.

647
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,160
Drink some water.

648
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,920
Nan Bei, be normal!

649
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,640
You're weird.

650
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,560
Review panel.

651
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,720
The evaluation of subsidies for poor students

652
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,720
was decided by each department at its own meeting

653
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,800
in previous years.

654
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,520
But this year, the school stipulates to

655
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,000
randomly select several departments

656
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,600
to cooperate to do it.

657
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,880
The school made this decision to prevent

658
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,960
the situation that evaluators

659
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,760
and the evaluated students are good friends.

660
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,560
So they don't have to feel awkward.

661
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,760
Do you have any objections?

662
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,120
How could we have no objections?

663
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,480
I have a question.

664
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,680
Why do we

665
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,800
have to do everything?

666
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,240
Are there no other students in our school?

667
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,760
It means that the members of our debate team

668
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,560
are excellent.

669
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,440
Yes.

670
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,160
I heard

671
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,680
that only students with high GPA

672
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,400
can attend the meeting.

673
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,280
Do you mean that my five-year GPA

674
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,440
is not as high as your two-year one?

675
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,360
OK.

676
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,080
Let me illustrate the standard.

677
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,000
The school has others poverty alleviation policies for

678
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,080
students who are in special poor.

679
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,920
So they are beyond

680
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,720
our discussion scope.

681
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
Now, the application forms

682
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,280
you can see now

683
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,600
are from ordinary students.

684
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Evaluations should be made

685
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,560
according to applicants' academic performance,

686
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,640
average per capital household income

687
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,960
and family background.

688
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,480
And,

689
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,840
I would also like to emphasize one thing.

690
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,480
Although our school can't give them

691
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,440
a large amount of money,

692
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,960
but for the poor students,

693
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,040
the money

694
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
is far more important

695
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,120
than we can imagine.

696
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,640
So everyone,

697
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,360
please make the evaluation

698
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,320
with a responsible attitude.

699
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,520
Hey.

700
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,000
Take it easy.

701
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,520
Don't worry.

702
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,680
I'm good.

703
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,000
So,

704
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,840
let's get started.

705
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,520
There is a student

706
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,080
whose family is in debt of 50 million yuan.

707
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,480
And their house was also mortgaged.

708
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,800
His family is in straitened circumstances.

709
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,480
Do you agree?

710
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,000
No.

711
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,040
I don't agree either.

712
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,920
If we make evaluations according to the debt situation,

713
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,520
Lin Chao from art management department

714
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,240
should take the grant.

715
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,880
His parents are rich.

716
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,400
Yeah.

717
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,280
But Lin Chao's family

718
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,040
owes the bank hundreds of millions yuan.

719
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,280
We should make a concrete analysis of each specific question.

720
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,360
OK, next one.

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,800
Next is a monitor.

722
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,760
Gao Zhenzhou

723
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,960
He is in the top five of grade.

724
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,880
And he gets excellent results in each subject.

725
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,160
He applied for the grant last year.

726
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,160
And he made it.

727
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,400
As long as he succeeded last year,

728
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,400
he should be able to meet the standard.

729
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,400
What's your opinion?

730
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,080
No.

731
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,800
Yes.

732
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,640
I agree.

733
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,240
He used the money

734
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,960
to set up a Happiness Fund.

735
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,600
Its purpose

736
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,960
was to lead all the students to a happy life.

737
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,200
But actually he used the money

738
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,760
to flirt with girls.

739
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,320
So how about this one?

740
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,600
In his family,

741
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,440
his father is the only labor force.

742
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,400
His family's annual income is less than 30,000 yuan.

743
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,520
He also has a younger sister

744
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,480
who just went to the primary school.

745
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,600
Even his tuition fee was borrowed from his relatives.

746
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
Family's annual income is less than 30,000 yuan.

747
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,040
That means the family's monthly income

748
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,600
is less than 2,200 yuan.

749
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,200
I think he meets the standard.

750
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,160
What about you?

751
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,720
I agree.

752
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,760
I agree.

753
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,680
I agree.

754
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,920
I agree, too.

755
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,440
Hao, what's wrong with you recently?

756
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,880
Don't mention it.

757
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,280
The previous treatment was excessive.

758
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,680
It has caused some complications.

759
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,240
So now she instinctively opposes everything.

760
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,160
We don't know that.

761
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,840
Ma Nan, why do you know that?

762
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,480
I told you before.

763
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Tao Hao is my research object

764
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,320
in psychology.

765
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,680
When something goes wrong, there must be a reason.

766
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,520
Hurry!

767
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,360
There are so many remained.

768
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,560
Let's move to the next one.

769
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,320
No.

770
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,320
So,

771
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,520
let's go on.

772
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,680
Go on.

773
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,880
What are you laughing at?

774
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,600
What are you looking at?

775
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,720
I'm watching love studies.

776
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,960
If you happen to act as six of them,

777
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,760
it means that you like him.

778
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,280
Let me have a look.

779
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,720
You look this kind of

780
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,560
pretentious forum.

781
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,320
It's a bluff.

782
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,200
It aims to fool people like you.

783
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,960
No, it's true.

784
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,240
Anyway,

785
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,960
it's true to me.

786
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,840
What is Nan Bei doing there?

787
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,600
Where is Nan Bei?

788
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,160
Where is he?

789
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,960
I don't see him.

790
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,920
He is the third one on the left.

791
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,920
I can see him at a glance.

792
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,520
Nan Bei

793
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,480
Yeah.

794
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,120
The first performance if you like a person is

795
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,880
that you can recognize him at a glance in the crowd.

796
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,760
And,

797
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,360
have you read the information

798
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,800
about poor students?

799
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,520
What's your opinion?

800
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,640
You don't want talk about it, right?

801
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
Let's go to eat something.

802
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,320
I know a delicious hot pot restaurant.

803
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,760
Let's go.

804
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,520
I don't want to go, I'm on a diet.

805
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,080
You go.

806
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,680
Why did you call me here?

807
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,600
What's the matter?

808
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,600
Can't I say hello to you

809
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,680
when I see you?

810
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,400
I'm leaving, goodbye.

811
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,680
Xiaoyu

812
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
Sister Tao Hao, can I sit next to you?

813
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,200
OK.

814
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,200
Everyone is here.

815
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,200
So let's go on the evaluation

816
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,240
according to the process of yesterday.

817
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,520
Ran Da's family

818
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,720
relies on subsistence allowances every day.

819
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,080
He meets all the standards.

820
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,840
Why did you kick him out?

821
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,240
Because his roommate reported

822
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,240
that he had just bought

823
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,560
a pair of roller skates worth 2,000 yuan.

824
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,320
So?

825
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,840
So he can't apply for

826
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,920
the grant for poor students.

827
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,720
Why?

828
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,080
A pair of roller skates worth 2,000 yuan

829
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
is a luxury.

830
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,000
He brought a luxury.

831
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,360
So he lost the right to apply for the allowance.

832
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
It's a convention.

833
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,720
Strictly speaking,

834
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
a pair of roller skates worth 2,000 yuan

835
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,920
is not a luxury.

836
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
It is at most

837
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,600
a medium and high-end entry-level product.

838
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,680
We should call it high consumption.

839
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,600
Then we can't approve it.

840
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,680
I don't agree.

841
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,760
What's wrong with you?

842
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,800
According to the convention,

843
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,960
we can't approve students with high consumption.

844
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,000
What convention?

845
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,000
Why are you always the special one with different thoughts?

846
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,240
We held this meeting

847
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,480
because we wanted to discuss

848
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,960
who could be given special care.

849
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,280
If we all follow the general trend,

850
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
we wouldn't have to hold this meeting.

851
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,520
Because most of the students

852
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,480
don't need the allowance.

853
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,800
That's a false deception.

854
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,040
I mean,

855
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,600
since our school has no clear provisions,

856
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,360
why should we obey that?

857
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
I think it's a hidden rule.

858
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Now, the point is

859
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,080
whether there are clear provisions

860
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,040
that stipulate

861
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,640
to disqualify the students with high consumption.

862
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
We don't have such provisions.

863
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,720
But if you have high consumption,

864
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,240
it should prove that you're not so poor.

865
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,480
Is there any

866
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,200
direct relationship

867
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,000
between consumption and poverty?

868
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,640
No.

869
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,920
But a student who goes to the canteen

870
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,160
but is reluctant to buy some meat

871
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,000
and a student who buys a pair of roller skates,

872
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,320
who do you think need the money more?

873
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,000
A student

874
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,400
whose phone is worth 1,000 yuan,

875
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,840
and a student

876
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,800
who uses an iPhone,

877
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,040
who do you think need the money more?

878
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,600
I don't agree.

879
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,120
I don't agree, either.

880
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,720
Now on the market,

881
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,840
a relatively cheaper iPhone

882
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,080
costs 5,000 yuan.

883
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,320
If a student

884
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,400
takes a part-time job in a milk tea shop,

885
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,200
he would have to stand

886
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,600
for eight hours a day.

887
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,880
During the eight hours,

888
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,640
he would have to keep brushing the cups,

889
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,320
adding water

890
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,120
and making milk tea.

891
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,160
He could earn

892
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,720
about 80 yuan each day.

893
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,560
That means

894
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,640
he would have to eat and drink nothing

895
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,720
for two months.

896
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,400
For him,

897
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,360
5,000 yuan is the cost of going home twice a year,

898
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,840
together with

899
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,320
all kinds of books,

900
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,920
medical treatment and social expenses for a school year.

901
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,960
Then,

902
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,880
another student

903
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,800
would buy an iPhone

904
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,960
with the money.

905
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,040
Who do you think

906
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,200
is more qualified to take the money?

907
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,720
So a poor student is not qualified

908
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,520
to use an iPhone, right?

909
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,560
If I meet

910
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,600
all the conditions of poor students,

911
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,640
because of the money,

912
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,720
should I be deprived of

913
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,120
all the rights to enjoy my life?

914
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,880
No.

915
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
But according to

916
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,600
the example I just gave,

917
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,880
who do you think need the money more?

918
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,520
The student could also save money

919
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,360
for a meal every day.

920
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,880
After a year,

921
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,760
he would be able to buy

922
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,280
a 5,000-yuan iPhone.

923
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,880
Couldn't he?

924
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,120
The money you saved

925
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,520
belongs to you.

926
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,240
But the poverty grant is not.

927
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,600
You can't use the country's money

928
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,800
to satisfy your own desires.

929
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,720
So,

930
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,320
as long as you've brought a pair of roller skates,

931
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,400
why do you need

932
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,480
the country's grant?

933
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,880
First of all,

934
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
we need to reach an agreement.

935
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Can high consumption

936
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,400
be a reason

937
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,760
to disqualify the grant application?

938
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,440
Yes.

939
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,960
It's true

940
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,120
that high consumption behavior can reflect

941
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,280
that he is not so poor.

942
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,840
As long as he is not so poor,

943
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,560
so this

944
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,440
is the reason

945
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,360
why he can't meet the standard of the poor students.

946
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,800
OK.

947
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
From your perspective, what kind of poor is real poor?

948
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,240
About this, there are provisions

949
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,760
in the subsidy rules.

950
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,400
But provisions don't ask him not to buy

951
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,520
a pair of roller skates.

952
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,520
His other conditions,

953
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,920
such as family background,

954
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,360
average per capital household income,

955
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,720
academic performance

956
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,680
and poverty situation,

957
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
can all meet the requirements.

958
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,560
Why can't we give him the grant?

959
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,840
You're right.

960
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,840
But the school asked

961
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,960
us to make the evaluations here.

962
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,040
Because they know that provisions are fixed.

963
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,680
They also need us to evaluate

964
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,640
whether a student is qualified

965
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,840
according to the reality.

966
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,760
I think that at least

967
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,920
one's high consumption can prove

968
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
that he is not so poor,

969
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,800
right?

970
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,080
Does a poor person

971
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,440
have the right to have high consumption?

972
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,760
Definitely yes.

973
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
So it is clear.

974
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,480
Imagine that

975
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,240
your "enough poverty"

976
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
can meet

977
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,680
the generally agreed poverty standard.

978
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
It doesn't need

979
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,760
any restrictions.

980
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,040
But the question is

981
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,800
how can we judge

982
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
that a person

983
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,560
who had high consumption behaviors

984
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,240
is not poor enough.

985
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,960
A high configuration computer

986
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,520
costs tens of thousands yuan.

987
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,120
For us,

988
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,240
it's certainly high consumption.

989
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,080
But for those students

990
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,280
who major in

991
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,960
animation,

992
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,120
it's an indispensable tool

993
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,960
for them

994
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,520
to do freelance jobs.

995
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,000
You can ask Dango about this.

996
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,280
So now,

997
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,000
how can we prove

998
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,520
that a so-called high consumption

999
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,480
must mean

1000
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,160
that his family is not poor enough?

1001
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,480
I can't prove that.

1002
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,920
I just think there is something wrong.

1003
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,560
Okay.

1004
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,400
Now you two have almost expressed yourself.

1005
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
Let's vote.

1006
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,280
Those who agree to give the grant to Ran Da,

1007
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,480
please raise your hand.

1008
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,080
Those who disagree, please raise your hand.

1009
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,200
Hao

1010
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,200
You don't have to object

1011
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,840
to show your character.

1012
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
I do think

1013
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,240
that what Xiaoyu said is right.

1014
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,320
The report is needed three days later.

1015
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,560
Then

1016
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,040
we'll vote again.

1017
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,880
That's all for today's discussion.

1018
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,480
It's a little tense

1019
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,120
due to the debate.

1020
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,600
How about we go to drink a cup of milk tea?

1021
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,280
My treat.

1022
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,920
The second performance if you like a person is

1023
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,120
facing with

1024
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,160
the sudden physical contact,

1025
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
you would feel shy

1026
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,160
and overwhelmed.
