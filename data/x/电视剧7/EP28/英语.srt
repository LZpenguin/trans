Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP28

2
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,880
Ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,320
Welcome to DUFE TV station.

4
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,680
I'm the substitute host, Shan Dan.

5
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,520
Recently, two debate teams in our university have

6
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,800
advanced to the top four of the provincial competition.

7
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,840
Let me bring you

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,240
a live report today.

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,800
Let's come to Team one first.

10
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,480
Come on, Team one.

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,360
We're too familiar with them.

12
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
So we won't waste time.

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,080
Let's come to Team 235.

14
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,680
Come on, Team 235.

15
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,720
We are the champions!

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Objectively speaking,

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
Nan Bei is right.

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
The opponents are strong.

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,640
We'll try our best.

20
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
We're the strongest even we won't try our best.

21
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,160
It's said that

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,200
the leader of Team one Liu Yanze

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
has been already taken.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,440
So

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,560
keep your hands

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,160
off him.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
OK. Come on.

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,080
Tao Hao, are you nervous today?

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,160
Mmm.

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:41,960
To be honest,

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
I must be a little nervous.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,120
But I think

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,720
my teammates

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,440
are ready for the competition.

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,440
Good luck.

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,280
Come on, Xiaoyu.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
Mmm, we.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,520
Come on.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,640
Are you confident of

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,840
winning the next competition?

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
We'll do our best.

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
It seems as if our team is going to win.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
You should have guessed.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,120
If we win,

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,600
we will wait for you in the final.

46
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,200
I found some of my previous feelings

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
while facing Liu Yanze.

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,160
How do you feel?

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,480
I want to hit him.

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,520
Hey.

51
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Your members are sitting well.

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
Your members

53
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
are very active.

54
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,160
Well.

55
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,440
I usually take the method of free range.

56
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,920
It can arouse

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
their enthusiasm.

58
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
Are you too strict with your members?

59
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
At least, you should have them...

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,480
You weren't strict at that time.

61
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,440
How did it end?

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,560
Ladies and gentlemen.

63
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Welcome to the semifinal

64
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
of the competition.

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm Li Yijie

66
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,840
the chief judge of the competition today.

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Today, the two teams

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,280
in the semifinal

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
will discuss which one needs more courage,

70
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,080
accepting the reality

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,760
or changing the reality.

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,480
So the point is that

73
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
accepting the reality

74
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,160
needs more courage than changing the reality.

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,080
Thank you.

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,120
Good argument. Solid and clear.

77
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,080
But the structure is too old.

78
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,640
Three-phase isn't popular now.

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,520
She's quite used to that.

80
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,000
So nostalgic.

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,680
It's hard to forget.

82
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,040
The definition is good.

83
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,600
I guess you will

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
address refutation in the first round

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
without reply.

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,840
Yes.

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,200
Whose idea is it?

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,360
It can be said that

89
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,240
the idea occurred to me because of you.

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,520
My fellow debaters pointed out in the argument that

91
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,320
sometimes the reality

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,040
is unchangeable.

93
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,760
So changing the reality

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
needs the courage to face despair.

95
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,680
Am I right, the first debater?

96
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,480
Yes.

97
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,600
Please give an example

98
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,360
that the reality

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,880
is unchangeable.

100
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,560
The third debater, please.

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
The attack is so vigorous.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,640
She

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,200
is rather brave.

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
For example, the law of gravitation

105
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,840
is unchangeable reality.

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,120
No, I don't think so really.

107
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
The gravitation

108
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,960
exists only in classical physics.

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,640
Because gravitation

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,240
is Newton's description

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
of reality

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,080
not reality itself.

113
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
What is the reality? The fourth debater, please.

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,920
Reality is

115
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,840
an objective fact

116
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,400
or thing.

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
If Newton's description itself

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,680
does exist,

119
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,400
why can't we

120
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,080
call it reality?

121
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Personally I think we can.

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,600
If reality cannot be changed,

123
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,200
what does changing the reality need?

124
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,840
Imagination

125
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,040
or courage?

126
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,680
The first debater, please.

127
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,920
Try to do what is impossible.

128
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't we need courage?

129
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,960
Team NEG broke the rules. No asking.

130
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,280
Xiaoyu is dragged down to Yin Nan's level.

131
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,800
She has a memory like a fish.

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,680
Don't blame her.

133
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,400
I remembered that you always raced to be the first to

134
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,840
answer questions and asked when you worried at that time.

135
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,600
So you always broke the rules.

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,400
So they are

137
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800
dragged down to my level.

138
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,640
The second debater in your team is good.

139
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,280
She's calm.

140
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
She

141
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
was not always like that.

142
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
She is a habitual criminal

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,760
like you.

144
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,640
But your refutation in this round

145
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,960
has not been substantially advanced.

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,240
It's good to play for a draw.

147
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,240
Really?

148
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,920
But I think

149
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,800
you have lost

150
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,440
a pre-emptive chance.

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,080
My fellow debaters.

152
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Does accepting the reality

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,080
means changing ourselves

154
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,960
according to you?

155
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,440
The fourth debater, please.

156
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,120
Yes.

157
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,240
So what's your standard

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
to judge which one

159
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,920
needs more courage?

160
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,600
The first debater, please.

161
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,400
The more difficult it is

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,560
the more courage it needs.

163
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,680
Why is it more difficult

164
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,480
to change ourselves

165
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,200
than to change the world?

166
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,160
Is your standard

167
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,880
based on

168
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,840
idealism?

169
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,160
The third debater, please.

170
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,880
Of course not.

171
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,640
Your side defined

172
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,680
changing the reality as the objective

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,200
while accepting the reality as the subjective.

174
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,080
It is problematic.

175
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
So what is accepting the reality?

176
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,760
It is a state

177
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,400
of not

178
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,160
making any changes to reality.

179
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Making a decision is certainly

180
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,840
a psychological process.

181
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
Why is the psychological process

182
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,480
not subjective?

183
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,960
The first debater, please.

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:17,960
Yes.

185
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
Making a decision

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
is a subjective psychological process.

187
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
But changing the reality

188
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120
also needs to make a decision.

189
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
Isn't it also a subjective

190
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,280
psychological process?

191
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,360
So what we want to compare today is

192
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,960
which one needs more courage

193
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
between the two.

194
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,920
Changing the reality

195
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,840
is a subjective process.

196
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,040
My fellow debater want to tell me that

197
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,360
high buildings rise from the ground

198
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,240
to hold back Wushan mountains' clouds and rain

199
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,280
till a smooth lake rises in the narrow gorges.

200
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,200
All of these depend on

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,880
subjective imagination?

202
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,280
The first debater, please.

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,960
No.

204
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
The point of your side is

205
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
the more difficult it is, the more courage it needs.

206
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,440
So

207
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,800
why is it more difficult

208
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,760
to change the world

209
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,600
than to change our hearts?

210
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,720
Change the

211
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,520
law of gravitation

212
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,680
or challenge the unfairness

213
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,440
of the society alone.

214
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,360
Which one is

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
easier than psychological construction?

216
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,400
I messed up.

217
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,760
We're done.

218
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
The judgment and definition

219
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
are both lost.

220
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,600
Team NEG attacked the argument

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,280
with the audience's first reaction.

222
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,640
And they forcibly linked

223
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,880
accepting and changing the reality

224
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,960
with subjectivity

225
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,040
and objectivity.

226
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,760
That made our argument

227
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,840
sound very ridiculous suddenly.

228
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,640
Do you think there's

229
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,360
something wrong with our attack?

230
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Your analogy itself

231
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,320
is very problematic.

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,160
You equated the movements of

233
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,280
changing the reality

234
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,720
with changing the world.

235
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,760
In fact,

236
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
we ignored

237
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,680
it must be psychological activities

238
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
that take courage

239
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
not the action itself.

240
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,960
Sure.

241
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,880
But now you have an

242
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,280
overwhelming advantage on the scene.

243
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,120
How to

244
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,960
express the meaning

245
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,880
effectively?

246
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
If I were the debater...

247
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,800
You will choose to attack.

248
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:47,960
Yes.

249
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,840
Now it's time for the third debater of Team AFF

250
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
to refute.

251
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,680
You defined accepting the reality as

252
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,480
"not rejecting".

253
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
But "not rejecting" is

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,120
a passive behavior.

255
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,080
So what courage does

256
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,000
a passive behavior need?

257
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,560
The third debater, please.

258
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,720
So it takes more courage

259
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,680
to change the reality.

260
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,440
You think it takes no courage

261
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,000
to accept the reality,

262
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,640
right?

263
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,160
The first debater, please.

264
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,080
What we discuss today

265
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,720
is not about whether your side needs courage

266
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,560
but to compare

267
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,360
accepting the reality

268
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
with changing the reality.

269
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
It certainly takes courage

270
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,200
for your side to accept the reality.

271
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
But it is less than

272
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,840
our side to change the reality.

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,960
When does "not rejecting"

274
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,760
take courage?

275
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,320
The fourth debater, please.

276
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,640
Why did Nan Bei

277
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,400
ask so many questions

278
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,480
about his motion

279
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,280
of the other side?

280
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,360
I don't know.

281
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,560
He must play his ace in the end.

282
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
This is called Socratic method.

283
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,640
Constantly develop continuous questions

284
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
about the point of the other side

285
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,480
until refutation.

286
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,640
Why not ask questions

287
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
about his own motion?

288
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,640
But the argument belongs to the other side.

289
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,040
I got it.

290
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,720
For example, I don't like

291
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,440
my blind date.

292
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,000
But due to my face

293
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,320
I still have to go to dinner with her.

294
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
I can't reject.

295
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,720
Is it a kind of courage

296
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,240
this time?

297
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,240
Is this courage

298
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,440
used in not rejecting

299
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,040
or in the

300
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,800
psychological process

301
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
of making up your mind?

302
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,280
The third debater, please.

303
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,640
The latter.

304
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,520
The psychological process itself

305
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
is an proactive behavior.

306
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,520
But courage

307
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,160
only matters on proactive behaviors.

308
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
Your side defined

309
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,200
accepting the reality as a passive behavior.

310
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,600
Isn't it contrary to

311
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,680
what we discuss today?

312
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,680
The fourth debater, please.

313
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,520
The point is that the psychological process

314
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,280
can guide behaviors

315
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,240
in the reality.

316
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,400
Isn't it the same?

317
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
If it is the same,

318
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
isn't the analysis and distinguishment of

319
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,960
subjectivity and objectivity

320
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,320
by the second debater

321
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,960
of your side meaningless?

322
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,320
The psychological process

323
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,360
guides practical action

324
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,160
no matter to accept

325
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,800
or change the reality.

326
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,160
Bravo!

327
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
Better than before.

328
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,960
Not bad.

329
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,920
My fellow debaters.

330
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
When you make a decision

331
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,840
facing the unknown

332
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
and the known,

333
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,880
is it more difficult

334
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,720
when you face the unknown?

335
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,200
The fourth debater, please.

336
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
For example, there are two buttons

337
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,720
in front of me.

338
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
I'll die if I push the first one.

339
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,520
I don't know what is going to happen

340
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,640
if I push the second.

341
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,560
The known is more frightening

342
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,040
than the unknown in the circumstances.

343
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
Are there

344
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,840
more timeservers

345
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,480
or people who brave the wind and the waves

346
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,680
in our society?

347
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,160
The second debater, please.

348
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,320
People who brave the wind and the waves.

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,280
Are there

350
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,680
more people who dare to

351
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,560
change the reality

352
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,600
or accept the reality?

353
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,080
The first debater, please.

354
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
It depends.

355
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,320
Today the development of the society is flourishing.

356
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,520
Most of us

357
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
choose to accept the reality.

358
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,240
But 80 years ago

359
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,320
during the War of Resistance Against Japan,

360
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,520
didn't the whole nation

361
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,440
rise in revolt

362
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
and change the reality of being trampled

363
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,360
by the Japanese invaders?

364
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,200
Very good.

365
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
So the history

366
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,320
greatly demonstrated the courage

367
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
of the Chinese nation, didn't it?

368
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,080
Why does the war of resistance need courage?

369
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,080
Does it take more courage

370
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
to change?

371
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,280
It certainly takes courage

372
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
to dare to fight against the invaders.

373
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
But the courage to face ourselves

374
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
and the real reality

375
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,880
is even more valuable.

376
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,080
This is the reason why

377
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,000
the theory of quick victory

378
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,760
that is eager to change the reality

379
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,680
and the theory of inevitable defeat

380
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,200
that cannot accept reality

381
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,480
have fallen through.

382
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,080
Only when we recognize the reality

383
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,920
can we find the real way to win.

384
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,160
From On Protracted War.

385
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,200
A draw.

386
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,440
Our theoretical logic

387
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,480
has not been repaired yet.

388
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,640
If we go on like this

389
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,840
you will still win.

390
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
But your team

391
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,240
is really good.

392
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm lucky.

393
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,120
You look like you're

394
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,880
back to the past.

395
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
In fact, I...

396
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Concentrate on the competition.

397
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,160
OK.

398
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,720
We ask for a pause.

399
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,080
Now Team NEG

400
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,280
has asked for a tactical pause.

401
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,480
A minute and a half.

402
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,840
Make good use of it.

403
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,800
During this period, the two teams and coaches

404
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
can come on stage to communicate with the debaters.

405
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,760
The timing starts right away.

406
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,520
The next step is to keep

407
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,560
our weak advantage.

408
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,560
But they have started to

409
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,400
counterattack at their own pace.

410
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,240
So I ask for a pause

411
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,320
to upset the pace.

412
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,080
Well done.

413
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,560
But the opponent

414
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,280
has the weak advantage now.

415
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,560
I reckon

416
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,440
their score is two or three points

417
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,200
higher than us.

418
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,080
But don't worry.

419
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,360
We can win back.

420
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,160
Diandian

421
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,160
The coach of Team NEG asked for a pause

422
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,720
to upset our pace.

423
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,680
Don't panic.

424
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,960
The most important next

425
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,040
is to repair our argument.

426
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
The next step is the summary.

427
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,080
It's your turn, Ma Nan.

428
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,240
OK.

429
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,240
After the pause

430
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
they should send their fourth debater

431
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,720
to summarize.

432
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
Their aim is to repair the argument.

433
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,240
No matter what perspective they repair from

434
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,840
you can break it

435
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,720
according to the original plan.

436
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,440
Got it?

437
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,840
OK. I see.

438
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,520
The summary

439
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,520
should avoid the attack point just now.

440
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
Break their point from

441
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,240
changing the reality

442
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,520
does not have absolute feasibility.

443
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,080
What do you think about it?

444
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:34,720
You're right.

445
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,560
Because there are many infeasibility in reality.

446
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
It is meaningless to simply equate it

447
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,880
with the degree of difficulty.

448
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,880
Although it doesn't hurt

449
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,400
our argument

450
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,360
the chance of winning is weak.

451
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,640
No.

452
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,920
I think

453
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,920
we should face

454
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,040
the questions in the refutation.

455
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,320
From

456
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,520
the perspective of changing the reality needs more courage.

457
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,480
But the point didn't have a leg

458
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,240
to stand on just now.

459
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,840
We can win back.

460
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,080
We can win only in this way.

461
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,760
Are you quite sure?

462
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,240
The coaches of the two teams have to go back now.

463
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,040
The competition will go on.

464
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,640
Believe me.

465
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
I believe you.

466
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,120
Come on.

467
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,520
Don't worry, Sa.

468
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,160
Come on.

469
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,960
Come on.

470
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,600
It's taken by surprise.

471
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,480
OK. The competition goes on.

472
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,400
Now let's invite one debater from Team AFF

473
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,280
to make a summary of refutation.

474
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,680
Thank you, the chief judge.

475
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,600
Ladies and gentlemen.

476
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
There must be one team

477
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,440
losing in the

478
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,280
competition today.

479
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,080
But when we have to

480
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,960
face the difficulties,

481
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280
how should we choose?

482
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,400
Face it

483
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,280
or escape from it?

484
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,240
It's really easy to escape from the reality.

485
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
I can make a scene.

486
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,760
I can say

487
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,600
there is an inside story of a plot.

488
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,520
I can no longer participate

489
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,360
in the debate.

490
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,520
I can also say I'm not the loser.

491
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,640
But what if I face it?

492
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I must admit that

493
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,960
I am inferior to others in skills.

494
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I should thank the opponent.

495
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,840
Even if I have reluctance and regret,

496
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,360
I should face it with a smile.

497
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,800
But for every debater

498
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
are you convinced of the result

499
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
of each game?

500
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,160
For adjudicators of the debate competition

501
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,960
is there an absolute

502
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,760
objective standard?

503
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,400
No.

504
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,680
But when we lose

505
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,560
in a competition we don't think

506
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,240
we will lose,

507
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,160
when we can't take part in

508
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,360
the competition on behalf of the school,

509
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,360
or when we have to

510
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
take part in some competitions

511
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,600
those can hardly be termed competitions,

512
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,840
how should we choose?

513
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,360
Face it or escape from it?

514
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,240
My fellow debaters said

515
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,040
changing the reality means

516
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,240
fighting against the rules of the world.

517
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,040
It's very difficult.

518
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,760
Changing the reality

519
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,480
will face everything unknown.

520
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,240
It's very difficult.

521
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,880
Changing the reality

522
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,760
will face a huge risk.

523
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,320
I will lose more.

524
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,960
It's very difficult.

525
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,080
But my fellow debaters.

526
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
There is one thing

527
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,160
more difficult

528
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,960
and arduous

529
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
than the sum total of the all.

530
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Ourselves.

531
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,960
When we should accept the reality,

532
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,760
it means we should change ourselves.

533
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,440
When we should accept

534
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,480
the fact that we should have a fight

535
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,080
it means we should

536
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,960
change our weakness.

537
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,440
When we should accept

538
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
the reality of losing our relatives,

539
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160
it means we should change

540
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,440
ourselves who are used to rely on others.

541
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,360
When we should accept ourselves

542
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,600
who have missed their true love

543
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,360
because of

544
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,680
our weakness and hesitation

545
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,560
or who have done a lot of stupid things

546
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,920
and said a lot of stupid words

547
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,600
because of our confusion

548
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,760
and shyness,

549
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
we must

550
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,600
change ourselves

551
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,120
to people who dare to pursue and know what we want.

552
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,040
Isn't it difficult?

553
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,400
It's too difficult.

554
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,040
We think

555
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,400
accepting the reality

556
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,280
takes more courage than changing the reality.

557
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,640
Because it's a

558
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,560
natural process.

559
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,480
It's a process

560
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,320
of cultivating ourselves.

561
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,040
In this process

562
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,120
although we're in a swamp,

563
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
our hearts are pursuing the starlight.

564
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,360
Thank you.

565
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
Now I have

566
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,640
got the result.

567
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,040
The winner of this competition is

568
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
Team 235.

569
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,480
Congratulations! Team 235 has advanced to the finals.

570
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,880
I didn't launch a fierce attack

571
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,440
for the sake

572
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
of Sa.

573
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,160
Let him treat.

574
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,920
I don't think he has time

575
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,480
at the moment.

576
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,880
Congratulations!

577
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,080
Thank you.

578
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,880
Hold her hands. Stupid.

579
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,120
Hold her hands.

580
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Stay here.

581
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm sorry to trouble you today.

582
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
Thank you for giving me a ride specially.

583
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,440
Throw the suitcase into the fountain.

584
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,200
Is it heavy?

585
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:18,960
No.

586
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
No, no, no.

587
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,320
Come on. Don't let her go.

588
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,800
Come on. Keep her.

589
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,360
Kabe-Don! Kiss her!

590
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,240
Sorry, sorry.

591
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm too excited.

592
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Well.

593
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,640
Bye.

594
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,040
Bye.

595
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,720
Wait, wait, wait.

596
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,360
She left.

597
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,800
Wait.

598
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,320
Diandian

599
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,240
So quick.

600
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,240
I thought I was going to chase for a while.

601
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,880
-What's wrong with you?  -Diandian.

602
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,440
Are you OK?

603
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,400
Diandian, please don't go.

604
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,960
Don't go to Canada.

605
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,280
Can you stay here?

606
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,960
No. I'll go with you

607
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,200
if you have to go.

608
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Will you take me with you?

609
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,520
I don't want to lose you again.

610
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,680
I don't want to

611
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,280
see you again

612
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,240
only when we get old.

613
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
I don't want to

614
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,200
regret your leave

615
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,720
and my weakness

616
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,840
from now on.

617
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
I don't want anything.

618
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,320
You take me away

619
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,840
like your

620
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,400
luggage

621
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
or stay here for me.

622
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,440
I must go to Canada.

623
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,800
But

624
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,960
I go there for visiting my relatives.

625
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
I'll be back.

626
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,760
You can't

627
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,880
leave me alone this time.

628
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,280
The final of the provincial debate league

629
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,920
will be held in two days.

630
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,440
The two teams in the final

631
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,160
are School Debate Team of DUFE

632
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,400
and the original Team two of DUFE

633
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,080
Team 235 now.

634
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
The school team

635
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,320
led by Liu Yanze

636
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,400
advanced to the final first

637
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,040
as the top in total points.

638
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,040
It is worth recalling that

639
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,920
the team

640
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,000
had once been the runner-up

641
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,920
with the same lineup in the league last year.

642
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,280
As the last social team

643
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,400
to have the chance

644
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,120
to advance to the league,

645
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,840
Team 235 was not favored at the beginning.

646
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,200
But as the dark horse

647
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,160
of the competition,

648
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,720
it advanced to the final

649
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
with the record of a complete victory.

650
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,160
Please look forward to

651
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,680
the summit competition.

652
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,720
Captain Tao Hao

653
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,760
That was a surprise hit

654
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,560
that you had won in the semifinal.

655
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,480
Did you think about it before the competition?

656
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,520
We didn't think too much

657
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
at the beginning.

658
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,120
We just want to

659
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,240
try our best in every competition.

660
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,880
Well. We don't have to think about it at all.

661
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,440
The result

662
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,360
met my expectations.

663
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,160
The opponent in the final is still Team one.

664
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,920
They defeated you

665
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,880
twice before.

666
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,640
Do you have confidence this time?

667
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,320
We will continue to work hard.

668
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,880
Of course we have confidence.

669
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,560
Especially confident.

670
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,080
I can tell you.

671
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,680
We had

672
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,360
put ourselves through the mill

673
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,000
for a long time

674
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
when Team one stayed in its comfort zone at school.

675
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,680
Ma Nan

676
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,440
As Hisashi Mitsui of Team 235,

677
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,480
how do you feel to return

678
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,240
to the competition?

679
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,960
I think Tao Hao

680
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
was hard because

681
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,880
she led the problem children before.

682
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,280
Let me introduce

683
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,840
myself to all of you.

684
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm the mainstay

685
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,400
of Team 235.

686
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,880
I'm Nan Bei.

687
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,160
I have the appearance of Kaede Rukawa

688
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,760
and

689
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,680
and the ability of...

690
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
No, no. The ability.

691
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,560
I, I'm

692
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,480
Nan Bei. Thank you.

693
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,440
Please remember me. Thank you.

694
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,960
So what do you think

695
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,680
is the key to win?

696
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,080
Maybe Liu Yanze of Team one.

697
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,560
No, it's me.

698
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,240
How do you feel?

699
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,840
Have you been intoxicated

700
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,200
with my beauty?

701
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,320
If I

702
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,200
break up with you

703
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,120
because you

704
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,760
have humiliated our team enough,

705
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I am not unreasonable, am I?

706
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Ah!

707
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
I found that you have

708
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,680
lost your fighting will

709
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,760
these days.

710
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,080
Even Dango

711
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,640
whose mind is empty

712
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
starts getting depressed.

713
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,240
Why is my mind empty?

714
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm just nervous.

715
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,320
I'm nervous, too.

716
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,240
I have not

717
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
slept well for two days.

718
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
Aren't you nervous, Nan Bei?

719
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,960
I only have

720
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,240
the excitement of revenge.

721
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,240
How about you, Ma Nan?

722
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,360
I don't have a strong feeling.

723
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,840
But if Hao is nervous,

724
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,520
I can cultivate myself in advance.

725
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,680
Thank you.

726
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,240
I wonder

727
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,000
why you're so nervous.

728
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,200
We are only one step away

729
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
from the champions.

730
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,160
How to say?

731
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
When You have a goal

732
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,080
that is still far away,

733
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
you rush forward like

734
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,960
you are full of beans.

735
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,240
But when the goal

736
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
is easily available,

737
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
you start worrying about personal gains and losses,

738
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,720
You're afraid of a moment of inattention

739
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,200
ah?

740
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,800
then your efforts will be in vain,

741
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,840
Yes.

742
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
Although I can't sum it up

743
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,800
I feel like this.

744
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,280
Why can't I feel it?

745
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,360
Sorry.

746
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
I thought you had were careless.

747
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,320
You are insensitive actually.

748
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,720
It is good.

749
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,960
All right.

750
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,280
We're going to take part in the competition soon.

751
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,560
It's normal to feel pressure.

752
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,160
We should turn pressure into motive force.

753
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,400
Let's get ready for the game.

754
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,600
Ladies and gentlemen.

755
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,080
Welcome to Campus Radio Broadcasting.

756
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,880
I'm the school hunk, Shan Dan.

757
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,000
As we all know

758
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
the strongest Team 235 of our school

759
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,920
has advanced to

760
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
the provincial finals

761
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,400
as easy as blowing off dust.

762
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,280
Although the opponent this time

763
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,000
is Team one

764
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,440
which defeated Team 235.

765
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,680
But over the past year

766
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,320
the Team 235 led by Nan Bei

767
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
remained true to their original aspiration

768
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,680
and kept their mission firmly in mind.

769
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm sure they can

770
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
make a wonderful turnaround.

771
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,840
Here

772
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,520
Nan Bei

773
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,160
leaves a message to Liu Yanze.

774
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,520
It's

775
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,880
show time.

776
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
Mu Xiaoyu leaves

777
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,840
a message to Yin Nan.

778
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,280
We'll increasingly kick back to you.

779
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,240
All right.

780
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,400
Finally, let's give a song

781
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,080
to Team 235.

782
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,560
We are the champion.

783
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,720
Captain

784
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,160
It is a little too much, isn't it?

785
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,080
Captain

786
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,560
You should keep your girlfriend under control.

787
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,760
Prepare for the competition.

788
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,920
Don't be disturbed by these things.

789
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
How much did you pay him?

790
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
That's all from my heart.

791
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,000
Nan Bei, how can you defeat

792
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,360
Liu Yanze like this?

793
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,120
Leave him alone.

794
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,800
There is something wrong with his brain.

795
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,120
Go on, go on.

796
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,920
Doctor, will you mind repeating that, please?

797
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,040
What diseases?

798
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,080
Doctor.

799
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,800
Zhang has been in hospital

800
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,120
for so long.

801
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,920
His condition hasn't improved.

802
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,280
You can just tell me

803
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,560
if there is something serious.

804
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
I can bear it.

805
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
Professor Zhang's disease

806
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
is lumbar spinal stenosis.

807
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,040
This is also the reason why

808
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,680
he often has lumbar and leg pain.

809
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,320
In addition, the centrum has a trend

810
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,680
of hyperosteogeny.

811
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,680
So

812
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,880
I suggest to have an operation

813
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,680
of laminectomy

814
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,600
and nerve root decompression as soon as possible.

815
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,320
Operations?

816
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,160
Can he do physical therapy?

817
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,960
Professor Zhang's left arm

818
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,920
and right leg have been numb

819
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,720
for half a year, right?

820
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,640
It seems that way.

821
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Yes. Half a year, right?

822
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,560
Almost.

823
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,800
Without the operation

824
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,240
Professor Zhang's morbidity

825
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,240
and intermittent claudication

826
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,360
will become more and more serious.

827
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,560
Even to the point where

828
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,880
he can't get of bed.

829
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,680
What?

830
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,160
Is it so serious?

831
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,080
What about operative risks?

832
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,400
Generally, such an operation

833
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,640
has a 90% chance of success.

834
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,040
Don't worry too much.

835
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,800
But.

836
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,160
But.

837
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,520
But what?

838
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,960
Any operation involves an element of risk.

839
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,040
And your lover

840
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,960
is old.

841
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,440
The risk is also increased.

842
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,680
Operation and postoperative recovery

843
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
have also changed.

844
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,400
In general, there is a 20% chance

845
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,360
that it will affect the results.

846
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,000
There will be paralysis led by

847
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,160
improper postoperative recovery

848
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,640
or the process of the operation.

849
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,400
Of course

850
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,920
conservative treatment is also a method.

851
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,880
Make up your mind as soon as possible.

852
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,360
Have a good rest, Professor Zhang.

853
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,480
Thank you.

854
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,760
Thank you, doctor.

855
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
There is still a 80% chance of success.

856
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,920
It's more than the chance

857
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,960
of waking up tomorrow.

858
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,600
297, 298,

859
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,280
299, 300.

860
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,840
OK, OK.

861
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,880
Great, great, great.

862
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,840
Tired?

863
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,360
Can it really relieve the tension?

864
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,840
Sure.

865
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,480
You must get

866
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,280
a good night's sleep.

867
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,520
Why?

868
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,600
Because you're tired.

869
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,800
Can you be serious

870
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,520
at this time?

871
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,280
Look.

872
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,960
As a captain

873
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,080
you should be confident

874
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,840
in your team.

875
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,520
As my girlfriend

876
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,000
you should be confident in

877
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,440
your boyfriend

878
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,080
who is the best debater.

879
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,000
Got it?

880
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,720
Yes.

881
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,160
Then I'll go back to the dormitory.

882
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
Then I'll go back after counting to ten.

883
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,440
OK.

884
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,760
I'm going to count with you.

885
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,280
One.

886
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,800
Two.

887
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,440
Three.

888
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,520
Four.

889
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,600
Five.

890
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,680
Six.

891
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:18,920
Six.

892
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,920
Six.

893
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,080
363 mutton shashliks.

894
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,880
364 mutton shashliks.

895
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,080
365 mutton shashliks.

896
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,920
366 mutton shashliks.

897
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,840
367 mutton shashliks.

898
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,360
The winner of this competition is

899
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,440
Team NEG. Congratulations!

900
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,760
The winner of this competition is

901
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,080
DUFE.

902
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,600
Not so bad.

903
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,160
My mentality is stable.

904
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,280
I'm afraid of a moment of inattention,

905
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,200
then our efforts

906
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,040
will be in vain.

907
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Let's talk about

908
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,600
debaters of the next competition.

909
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,280
Of course you four.

910
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,040
You're the strongest.

911
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,080
Dango

912
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,480
Although you took part in the competition not very often

913
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,080
after Ma Nan joined us,

914
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,880
we

915
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,800
never questioned

916
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,560
your ability.

917
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,240
Yes.

918
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,360
You are also the main force of the school team.

919
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,960
If you want to take part in the competition, tell us.

920
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,920
It's OK that you put it forward.

921
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,080
I think Dango...

922
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,680
Stop.

923
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,040
I know you're going to

924
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,280
begin a series of personal attacks.

925
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,720
I think Dango can take part in the next competition.

926
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Who will exit?

927
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,120
Me.

928
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,920
You don't want

929
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,040
us to beg you,

930
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,360
do you?

931
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,560
Of course not.

932
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,280
We can consider this problem

933
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,160
from two aspects.

934
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,680
One.

935
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,000
The old coach isn't here.

936
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,000
Sa is also

937
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,240
immersed in love.

938
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,240
I can give you some help

939
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,560
off the court.

940
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,880
Two.

941
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
I've really been feeling

942
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,480
a little sick lately.

943
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,680
What's wrong with you?

944
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,840
I've been vomiting lately.

945
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,560
And I feel giddy and light-headed.

946
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I also have ascites.

947
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,600
I feel like I've

948
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,520
lost weight recently.

949
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,360
But my belly is very big.

950
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,840
Are you OK?

951
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,720
Can you hold on?

952
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,240
I don't know.

953
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
But I feel terrible anyway.

954
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,680
Let's go to the hospital.

955
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,200
No.

956
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,400
I've been there already.

957
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,520
The doctor said

958
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,680
I had to have injections during this period.

959
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,080
This period?

960
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,960
It sounds serious.

961
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,600
Do you have an

962
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,840
injection of 411?

963
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,800
Yes, yes, yes.

964
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,080
That's it.

965
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,400
I don't know why I feel terrible.

966
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,880
You have got feline infectious peritonitis(FIP).

967
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,360
This disease is not contagious.

968
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,080
Still you're such a tease.

969
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,480
Wanna die?

970
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,560
Ah!

971
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,640
Ah!

972
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I had a headache.

973
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,880
I can't make it.

974
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,880
I have backache and appendiceal pain.

975
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,400
And I have a stomachache. It hurts everywhere.

976
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,480
Ah!

977
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,560
Parents, please pay attention.

978
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,160
FIP is no longer a terminal disease.

979
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,640
If the babies have continuous low fever,

980
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,400
suffer from loss of appetite

981
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,160
and their globulin ratio

982
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,240
is lower than 0.6,

983
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
please be treated in time.

984
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,640
They can be saved.

985
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,320
Does Nan Bei feel sick

986
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,000
for real?

987
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,480
Would you like to visit him?

988
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,520
It must be that Xiaoyu

989
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
has put all her mind

990
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,360
on the competition and ignored him.

991
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,440
So he wants to find a sense of existence.

992
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,960
I guess he was reprimanded too much

993
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,240
by us yesterday

994
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,840
So he wants to pay attention to

995
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,480
this competition today.

996
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,400
Wow!

997
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,200
Hao, did you make a fortune?

998
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,360
We didn't order so much.

999
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,160
For free.

1000
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,080
What's wrong?

1001
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,240
Are you familiar

1002
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,160
with us after so long?

1003
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,720
Why did it end so early today?

1004
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,760
I want to see Xiaoyang sing.

1005
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,040
That's it.

1006
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,080
Xiaoyang, where are you going?

1007
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,920
We are about to graduate.

1008
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,360
And the owner here said

1009
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,080
it would be renovated.

1010
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,320
We're leaving.

1011
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
Then tell me

1012
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,520
your next place.

1013
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,360
We will visit you

1014
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,920
after the competition.

1015
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,720
We're disbanded.

1016
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,280
What?

1017
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,240
You're disbanded?

1018
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,080
The band has been established for nearly four years.

1019
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,760
We haven't got something done.

1020
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,680
Shui has been working hard for a long time.

1021
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
We feel sorry for him.

1022
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,680
It's good.

1023
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,720
In this way, things will be easier for me.

1024
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,920
I won't wash dishes

1025
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
and be a delivery guy in the future.

1026
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,800
Shui has been working to support

1027
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,440
the band's expenses.

1028
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,120
Otherwise, it won't last four years.

1029
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,440
So

1030
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,440
for us

1031
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
it's a relief.

1032
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,040
We don't know where

1033
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,240
to put these things.

1034
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,080
How about the loft where we usually train.

1035
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,880
We often train for the debate

1036
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,000
and hardly go there.

1037
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,240
That's great.

1038
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,280
Come on.

1039
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,360
Your gifts.

1040
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,240
Drink for free.

1041
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
What about me?

1042
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,640
Drink for free.

1043
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,600
That's great.

1044
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,520
Shui, I...

1045
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,920
OK, you're all in my heart.

1046
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,400
No.

1047
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,800
I mean

1048
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,600
would you mind giving me another one?

1049
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,840
I'll give it to my boyfriend.

1050
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,200
Doctor.

1051
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,160
You said there was a 80% chance of success.

1052
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,480
That's to say

1053
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,080
he will be fine, right?

1054
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,280
No operation can guarantee

1055
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
a 100% chance of success.

1056
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,280
I can only say that the success rate is very high.

1057
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,840
Is there any other way

1058
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,040
except the operation?

1059
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,280
If you choose conservative treatment

1060
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,640
you can rely on medicine and daily physiotherapy

1061
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,880
just like before.

1062
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,040
But according to the physical checkup report

1063
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,280
he has missed

1064
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,120
the best period of medicine physiotherapy.

1065
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
It may cause paralysis.

1066
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,240
Of course, it varies from person to person.

1067
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,240
Well, doctor.

1068
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,560
We need to have a discussion.

1069
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,000
OK. Make up your mind as soon as possible.

1070
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,320
OK.

1071
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,160
Thank you.

1072
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,560
Thank you.

1073
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:48,800
You're welcome.

1074
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,640
Hey!

1075
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,600
What are you eating behind my back?

1076
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,640
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.

1077
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,280
Sa

1078
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
He won't do as he is told.

1079
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,440
I said I couldn't eat greasy food.

1080
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
I'm sick.

1081
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,880
The meat is an expression

1082
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,000
of the good will.

1083
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,480
It's a pity to throw it away. So I...

1084
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,440
OK, OK, OK.

1085
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,600
Just one bite.

1086
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,120
Zhang

1087
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,360
I have a piece of good news to tell you.

1088
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:29,960
What?

1089
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,800
I talked with the doctor just now.

1090
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,360
The doctor said

1091
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,960
you don't have to

1092
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,200
have an operation in your current situation.

1093
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,960
So

1094
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,840
you can eat what you want.

1095
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,560
Tell me if you want to eat something.

1096
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,680
I'll cook for you.

1097
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,400
But your levels of blood lipids

1098
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,080
and blood sugar are a little higher.

1099
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,680
So

1100
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,160
you should control them.

1101
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,000
Got it?

1102
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,080
Got it?

1103
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,680
You can

1104
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,040
tell me the truth.

1105
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,120
How many days can I live?

1106
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,280
Bah!

1107
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,720
What are you talking about?

1108
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,120
What are you talking about?

1109
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,400
I will leave if you say like this.

1110
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,560
I'm wrong.

1111
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm wrong.

1112
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,120
I just feel that

1113
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,600
don't I have to have an operation?

1114
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,400
Of course you don't have to have an operation.

1115
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,360
OK.

1116
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,840
Happiness comes a little suddenly.

1117
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,960
I'm not used to it.

1118
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,840
What do you want to eat for dinner?

1119
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,840
I want to eat kung-pao chicken.

1120
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,040
Kung-pao chicken, right?

1121
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,640
OK, I'll cook for you.

1122
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,360
It's so kind of you.

1123
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,040
Well.

1124
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,000
Our two teams

1125
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,800
are going to have a competition soon.

1126
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,400
Is it good that we

1127
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,120
always meet like this?

1128
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,200
How about

1129
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,480
not meeting before the game?

1130
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,280
I feel that

1131
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,720
perhaps we should avert suspicion before the competition.

1132
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,680
We don't have to.

1133
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,440
Really?

1134
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,240
It's OK as long as

1135
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,200
we don't talk about this.

1136
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,160
And

1137
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,680
we haven't talked about

1138
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,760
the debate before.

1139
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,440
You're right.

1140
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,280
I thought you would agree.

1141
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,320
I know the answer

1142
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,520
to the question with potential danger.

1143
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,840
By the way.

1144
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,960
Nan Bei is odd recently, right?

1145
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,280
How did you know that?

1146
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,240
I saw him in the supermarket just now.

1147
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,120
What was he doing?

1148
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,960
He looked furtive.

1149
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,280
Nan Bei didn't come to the training again.

1150
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,600
If I grab him later,

1151
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,480
I will fold him and throw him into the city moat

1152
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,080
to feed the ducks.

1153
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,160
It's cruel and useless.

1154
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,840
He won't tell you in this way.

1155
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
What should I do?

1156
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,760
Bind him down and keep watch on him?

1157
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,600
Don't be too violent.

1158
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,640
At this time

1159
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,520
you should use

1160
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,840
the weapon of girls.

1161
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,440
What?

1162
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,000
Swords, guns or what?

1163
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,560
I don't mean that.

1164
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,440
It's tenderness.

1165
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,200
Tenderness?

1166
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,680
I don't have it.

1167
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,920
Nan Bei, follow me.
