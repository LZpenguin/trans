Hello Debate Opponent 2 EP18

2
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,480
This is a sweet story.

3
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
Romantic.

4
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,520
Then?

5
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Then...

6
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,360
There was nothing romantic.

7
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
How poor Xiaoyu was!

8
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,560
Right, Xiaoyu was poor.

9
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,160
And she just told me

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,520
about this thing.

11
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,200
And she emphasized thousands of times

12
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,520
that I can't tell anyone else.

13
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,640
Or she will kill me.

14
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,040
So don't tell anyone else

15
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,120
please.

16
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,160
Why don't you eat?

17
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,360
What are you thinking?

18
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
What's wrong with you?

19
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,680
Why do you come back suddenly?

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Well, you can come back.

21
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
But why do you treat me with dinner?

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,760
Well, you can treat me with dinner.

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
But why do you treat me alone?

24
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,960
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Then you should ask me directly

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,720
if I have a boyfriend.

27
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,840
What if I have a boyfriend?

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,000
Say something.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's bad that

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I say I have a boyfriend.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,680
It seems that

32
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,840
I think too much.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Why do you come back suddenly?

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,000
I heard from classmates that

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
you went to university abroad.

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
It's spring break.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,760
I come back this time

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,680
to be the leader of my friend's debate team.

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,040
I remember

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,440
you liked to debate

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,360
when you were in high school.

42
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,160
Right.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,040
I'm debating now.

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,000
So he comes back for coaching the debate team.

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,200
In fact,

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
I come back this time

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,400
for one person.

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
What's wrong?

49
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,120
Well.

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,400
Then?

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,000
Nothing.

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,480
I just come back.

53
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,840
Let's catch up

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,840
over this meal.

55
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,560
Eat.

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,720
What are you two doing?

57
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,120
Get in and see for yourself.

58
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,640
Write a love song for you.

59
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,080
Can't sing unfinished.

60
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
Take all the...

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,680
Stop crying.

62
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,000
I told you

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,320
that if you cry any more,

64
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
you'll bring the dormitory manager over.

65
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,280
You'll be happy

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,720
when he takes away

67
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,480
all our limited edition magazines.

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,360
Are you crazy?

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,120
Are you serious?

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,680
Hey.

71
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,560
He was dumped.

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,760
She is, after all, a goddess

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,440
and encounters many temptations.

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,720
This thing was like this.

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,080
Jingwen

76
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,120
Our...

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Our track and field team has extra training today.

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I have tried my best

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,440
to get here.

80
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,080
But I was still a full

81
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,720
three minutes late.

82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,640
It's okay. I don't mind.

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
It's not okay!

84
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm a man.

85
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,040
I made you wait for me here.

86
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm such a failure.

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,000
It's okay.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,160
Let's have dinner first.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,040
Let's go.

90
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,720
Let's go.

91
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,640
What's wrong with you?

92
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,200
Could you wait me for a minute?

93
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,840
I just ran too fast

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,680
and got a leg cramp.

95
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,200
Are you okay?

96
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm okay.

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Do you want to sit for a while?

98
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,240
No!

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,560
I can walk.

100
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,360
Wait. Wait.

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Listen to me.

102
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,840
We can have a rest there.

103
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
We can have dinner

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,920
when you feel better, okay?

105
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
We have plenty of time anyway.

106
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,320
What's wrong with you?

107
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,120
Nothing. Nothing.

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,840
I, I just feel

109
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,400
so

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
so happy.

111
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,120
No girl has ever been

112
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,480
so nice to me.

113
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
Alright. Let's go now.

114
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,480
Take care.

116
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
This one.

117
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,000
Then a plate of green asparagus.

118
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,520
A plate of artemisia stalks.

119
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,040
And two plates quail eggs.

120
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,640
Okay.

121
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
Anything else?

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,280
You like bland food.

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,480
Don't put pepper in

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,800
any of our dishes.

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,320
And put less salt.

126
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
By the way, I want

128
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,440
two plates of beef and lamb hind legs.

129
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
You like these.

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
Make them more tingly and spicier, thanks.

131
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,600
No. No.

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,760
We don't take the dishes she ordered.

133
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,480
We just have what I ordered.

134
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,760
Okay. Please wait for a minute.

135
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,800
The dishes you ordered

136
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,520
have a strong flavor.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,000
Even if I eat them,

138
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
it'll affect your

139
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,360
consumption.

140
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,920
Jingwen, please don't be angry.

141
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm not angry.

142
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,880
Really?

143
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,280
Really.

144
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,640
Oh my! Don't

145
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,560
be angry.

146
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
From dinner to now,

147
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
you should have calm down.

148
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Even if you're still angry,

149
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,440
you should tell me

150
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
what I said

151
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
or did wrong.

152
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
You want me to tell you the reason or you find it by yourself?

153
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,440
You tell me.

154
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
I got it. I got it.

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,520
It is because I

156
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
was late just now.

157
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Or

158
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,400
the meal just now was not to your liking.

159
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,720
Alright. Alright.

160
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,400
Anyway, it's my fault.

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,160
I did everything wrong.

162
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,840
Jingwen. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

163
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,680
Stop!

164
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
Mengyuan, I want to have a talk with you.

165
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay.

166
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
As a result,

167
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,040
she...

168
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
How can this happen?

169
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,800
Does she happen to be in a mood

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,400
these days?

171
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,000
No.

172
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,000
It can't be true.

173
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,800
It must be

174
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
the problem

175
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
that never reason with girls.

176
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,640
I don't think so.

177
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,120
And I think there's

178
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,320
nothing wrong with Mengyuan.

179
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,720
Right?

180
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,960
I also don't think

181
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,720
I did anything wrong.

182
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,880
Don't worry.

183
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,160
Jingwen is not

184
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,520
a capricious girl.

185
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,440
Maybe she is in a mood.

186
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
And you don't know the situation.

187
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
This makes her angry.

188
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,240
You should wait.

189
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,920
Wait.

190
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,760
She'll calm down soon.

191
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,880
But it has been three hours.

192
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,240
She hasn't responded to any of my messages.

193
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,200
According to my experience,

194
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
I think

195
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,800
after a good sleep,

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
tomorrow morning,

197
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,440
hey,

198
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,680
she maybe let it go

199
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,760
and won't be angry anymore.

200
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,240
You can come to her at this time.

201
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
Thing will be done.

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
Hey bro.

203
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
You can really bear it.

204
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,440
I have just practiced how to close my five senses recently.

205
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,520
Do you want to learn?

206
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
I tell you

207
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
being in love

208
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,880
is a new beginning relationship.

209
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,240
And boys usually can't realize it.

210
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
As the ancients used to say

211
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,040
cultivate the bitterness of love

212
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,240
and let go of past desires.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
That's the lyrics!

214
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,160
Yeah.

215
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,000
I come to give you...

216
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,520
Hello.

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
Hello. Come out to buy milk tea.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,520
Why do you drink milk tea again?

219
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,000
Aren't you afraid of

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,280
becoming too fat to deserve me?

221
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,200
How dare you?

222
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,080
But I don't have time.

223
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,480
Mengyuan is dumped

224
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,440
in no reason.

225
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm comforting him now.

226
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,640
Let's make a hypothesis

227
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,800
that you are dumped

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,600
because of

229
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,320
a cup of milk tea.

230
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,840
Do you

231
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,640
like this hypothesis?

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,720
Wait for a minute.

233
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,520
Then they broke up?

234
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,760
Don't you think Mengyuan is poor?

235
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,960
I think

236
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,040
it is because he is too cowardly.

237
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,080
He has been like this.

238
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,840
You say he is cowardly.

239
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
How do you get this conclusion?

240
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
The thing is like this.

241
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,000
At first,

242
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
it is his manliness

243
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
that attracts Jingwen.

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
But now, he indulges her everywhere.

245
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Jingwen thinks,

246
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:30,880
hey,

247
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,520
he is not the one

248
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,400
she liked primarily.

249
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,000
He has changed.

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,520
He has changed?

251
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,320
Yeah.

252
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,680
I find your girls' thoughts

253
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
are really abnormal.

254
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,240
Is it a bad thing to be nice to her?

255
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
If I become

256
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
as naive and straightforward as Mengyuan in the future,

257
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
will you not like me anymore?

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,560
No way.

259
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,160
You are too feminine to change.

260
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,040
But I still can't agree with

261
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,960
your girls' opinions.

262
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,320
However,

263
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,240
I think my girlfriend

264
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
is more reasonable.

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,420
Right.

266
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,120
Who did you have dinner with?

267
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,800
Gong Chen

268
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,240
Gong

269
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,800
Chen?

270
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,120
Right.

271
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
Why... Why didn't you tell me in advance?

272
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,520
I told you

273
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,400
that I would have dinner with a friend.

274
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,480
But you haven't told me

275
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
the friend is him!

276
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,720
You haven't asked me.

277
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,600
I, I haven't asked?

278
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
What else did you do besides having dinner?

279
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,440
We chatted about the old days.

280
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,000
Apart from

281
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,720
chatting,

282
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
did he send you back?

283
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,920
Why should he send me back?

284
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,760
We're not on the same route.

285
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,560
Are you jealous?

286
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,280
No, I'm not.

287
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,080
I...

288
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I care about you.

289
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,520
Well. Well.

290
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,520
So feminine.

291
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,360
I have arrived.

292
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,080
I'll leave.

293
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
You are leaving now?

294
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,280
I haven't finished the milk tea.

295
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,840
You have training tomorrow.

296
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,880
Don't you need to go to bed early?

297
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,480
Alright,

298
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,920
I have to wait 11 hours

299
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,760
to see you.

300
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,960
Don't close the window

301
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,040
when you sleep at night.

302
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,120
What?

303
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,800
Don't you afraid the dormitory manager finds you?

304
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,800
Then

305
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,400
I can come into your dream

306
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,520
through the window.

307
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,640
Don't

308
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,840
say such corny honeyed words anymore.

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,760
Don't you think it is disgusting?

310
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,920
It's not for kids. It's not for kids.

311
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,800
Where are the kids?

312
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,480
Me.

313
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,960
You can go now.

314
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,160
You told him?

315
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,120
I told him half of the things.

316
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,400
Flirt is no use.

317
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,040
That's great.

318
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,120
What did you talk about just now?

319
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,760
Nothing.

320
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,240
He just said his school was on spring break.

321
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
He came back to be a coach

322
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,440
of a debate team.

323
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,720
He said he came back

324
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
for one person.

325
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
But I don't know who he came back for.

326
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,520
That must be you.

327
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,480
I told you

328
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,560
he knew you

329
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,360
liked him in those years.

330
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,800
So he must think

331
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
you are good now.

332
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,720
And he came back for you.

333
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,840
Nonsense.

334
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,640
Have you told him

335
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,000
that you have boyfriend?

336
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,680
I tell you

337
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,480
I was just about to tell him

338
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,880
when Nan Bei called out of the blue.

339
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,840
I was scared.

340
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,160
Do you still

341
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,440
like him?

342
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,960
No way! Sister.

343
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm really single-minded, okay?

344
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
I saw his face

345
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,080
with no feelings anymore.

346
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,920
Alright.

347
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,240
I think you and Nan Bei are matched anyway.

348
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,600
Stop gossiping about me, okay?

349
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,880
What about you?

350
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,600
The specialized segmentation

351
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
will collect forms tomorrow night.

352
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,840
Alas.

353
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,720
Don't mention it.

354
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,080
I told my mom yesterday

355
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,120
that I want to have a try.

356
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,600
Then?

357
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Then my mom said

358
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm overconfident

359
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,840
and lack of self-cognition.

360
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,440
To be honest,

361
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,680
after hearing these words,

362
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,000
I doubt

363
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,160
if I can do this.

364
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,960
Well.

365
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,080
I support you,

366
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,440
baby.

367
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
Hey, bro.

368
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,880
Can't you stop

369
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,640
for the weekend?

370
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
I was just dreaming about Jingwen.

371
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,960
I dreamed that she told me

372
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,120
the breakup was a joke.

373
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
I was so happy.

374
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,080
I rushed up to send her a message.

375
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,920
However,

376
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,040
however, I found

377
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,760
that she has ghosted me.

378
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,040
I want to ghost you, too.

379
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
Oh my god.

380
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,600
If you are so sad,

381
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
you should get her back.

382
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,720
Right, you should go to Jingwen.

383
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,920
Leave us alone!

384
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,800
The cheekier you are,

385
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,840
the longer you will last

386
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,360
in a relationship.

387
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,640
Right.

388
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
By the way,

389
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,680
the more you pay attention to the small details,

390
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,320
the more you can make her feel

391
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
that you care about her.

392
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,440
You can do like this.

393
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,840
Flower.

394
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Yeah, right, flower.

395
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
No girl

396
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,400
can resist

397
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,720
the fragrance of flowers.

398
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Jingwen

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
I have something for you.

400
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,000
What?

401
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,400
What's wrong with you?

402
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm allergic.

403
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,720
Why do you buy flowers if you're allergic?

404
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,440
Are you stupid?

405
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
I think it's...

406
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,080
romantic.

407
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,840
I'm so touched by your behavior.

408
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
But please don't

409
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,120
do this in the future.

410
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,000
Jing...

411
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,040
Jingwen

412
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
That's it?

413
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Then I think game is over.

414
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,760
No.

415
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,920
On the contrary,

416
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
he has opportunities.

417
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,800
And he really has opportunities.

418
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,600
Think about it.

419
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,880
Don't forget

420
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,600
that Jingwen took the flower.

421
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,000
And when she took the flower,

422
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,640
she said

423
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,720
"in the future".

424
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,920
This proof you have a future.

425
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,480
Really?

426
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,640
Oh my!

427
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,520
Yes.

428
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
Let's move on to the next step.

429
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,800
You can pester her.

430
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,240
Make her feel your love,

431
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,320
your goodness.

432
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Her heart

433
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,440
will definitely belong to you.

434
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,960
Jingwen, you can focus on your class.

435
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,480
Just pretend I don't exist.

436
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,960
It is hard

437
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,360
for this thing

438
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
to change

439
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,560
in one's heart.

440
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,240
As a result,

441
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,160
human should

442
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,880
make sure that...

443
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,920
Shouldn't you

444
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,720
be training with the track team at this time?

445
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,720
I just want to be with you.

446
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,680
Everything else is not important.

447
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,840
Each processing method

448
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,560
produces a corresponding

449
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,360
body.

450
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,640
Where to start,

451
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
where to go from there.

452
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,000
Make love return to the point of origin.

453
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Let love

454
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
set sail again.

455
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,600
When she comes,

456
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,960
you get down on one knee

457
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,480
in this circle.

458
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,280
Make sure she feels

459
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,440
that you are sincere in your apology.

460
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,800
When she forgives you,

461
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,560
you scatter the balloons.

462
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,360
It means

463
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,280
letting go of the past

464
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,200
and looking forward to a better future.

465
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,120
Thank you, buddy.

466
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,720
My pleasure.

467
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,520
That's all I can do for you.

468
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,400
The rest is up to you.

469
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,240
She's coming. She's coming.

470
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,480
She's coming. She's coming.

471
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:01,880
Ready.

472
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,920
Jingwen

473
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,960
I have something to tell you.

474
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,440
I know

475
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,480
I may have done something wrong

476
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,120
or expressed something wrong

477
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,600
that has caused you to misunderstand.

478
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I want to tell you

479
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,520
that no matter what happens in the future,

480
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,440
I will be by your side

481
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,360
all the time,

482
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
taking care of you and protecting you.

483
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,120
Jingwen

484
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,000
please forgive me.

485
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,000
How romantic!

486
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
So romantic.

487
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,040
Oh my!

488
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Why does she go?

489
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,040
What does she tell you?

490
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,080
Does she forgive you?

491
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,520
Jingwen says

492
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,440
she breaks up with me.

493
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
She breaks up with me.

494
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Jingwen

495
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,280
Leave here.

496
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,560
She breaks up with me. She breaks up with me.

497
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,000
Bro, give me that, okay?

498
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,240
Please.

499
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,960
Play the wrong BGM?

500
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Mengyuan

501
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,520
Turn down the music first.

502
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,000
Pull yourself together!

503
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,640
You pick yourself up.

504
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,240
Let's do it again.

505
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,040
Again what?

506
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,200
Your strategy is wrong.

507
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,520
You should follow my plan.

508
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,840
Have you ever been reliable with your plan?

509
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm reliable than yours.

510
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,880
Now game is over.

511
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,640
I'm reliable or not?

512
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,040
I haven't said...

513
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,080
Listen to me. I haven't said

514
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,840
the game is over.

515
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,080
Our plan is just beginning.

516
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,840
Bro, stop singing.

517
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,400
Look at me.

518
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
Stop. Stop. Stop. Don't touch him.

519
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Does it really calm the mind?

520
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,120
You'll get the result tonight.

521
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,360
What are you talking about?

522
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,960
We're talking about whether this tea

523
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,760
can help us catch up on sleep.

524
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
You guys don't know

525
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,280
that we were kept awake for days and nights

526
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,800
by Mengyuan's noise for the past days.

527
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,200
I've heard from the boys in my class

528
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
that your dorm room

529
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,480
is like a ringing bomb.

530
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,320
There's a single song loop every night,

531
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
and someone cries.

532
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
So scary.

533
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,120
Bro.

534
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,120
Give us a favor.

535
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,000
Do something

536
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,840
to help put our dorm out of its misery.

537
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,920
What can I do?

538
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,160
Can you, me and Dandan, the three of us

539
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,600
beat Mengyuan?

540
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,680
Kids

541
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,480
The topic of the next debate is out.

542
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,480
What is it?

543
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,120
In a relationship

544
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,200
should we go with the flow

545
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,720
or manage it?

546
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
Our holding side is to work hard.

547
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
Love topic.

548
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,680
I'm good at this.

549
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,720
You have experience.

550
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,320
Mengyuan happens to have experienced it.

551
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,400
A good example.

552
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,600
Really?

553
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
How about sharing

554
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,680
your experience?

555
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
If you want to end a relationship,

556
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
you can ask him for advice on his experience.

557
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,040
Nonsense.

558
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,600
Mengyuan is a special case, a special case.

559
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,800
Generally speaking,

560
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,280
anyone who's been begged so hard

561
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,160
would have already agreed, right?

562
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
It's not that he doesn't work hard.

563
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,880
He doesn't know

564
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,680
how to manage reasonably.

565
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,000
It's different from our debate topic.

566
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,360
I agree.

567
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
Efficient management counts.

568
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,240
Ineffective efforts

569
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,400
are counterproductive.

570
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,360
So it proves

571
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,320
love has to be managed with brains

572
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,760
and heart.

573
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,360
It depends.

574
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,720
The kind of thing that goes with the flow,

575
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,400
like me and Xiaoyu,

576
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
is definitely true love, isn't it?

577
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,960
You mean you wouldn't read books anymore

578
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,560
after the exam, right?

579
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,640
Read after exam?

580
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,080
It's not the same thing. Don't fool me.

581
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,840
Feelings are mutual in a relationship.

582
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,680
What's the most important thing in a relationship?

583
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
It's trust.

584
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Second, it's communication.

585
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,880
Based on this,

586
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,360
to run a better relationship

587
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,160
and to avoid some trouble,

588
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,800
it is not necessary

589
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,520
to let your partner know everything,

590
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,000
right?

591
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,760
No.

592
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,560
If you trust each other,

593
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,680
you should say everything.

594
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,400
If the other person

595
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,520
doesn't feel the need to say it,

596
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,640
it doesn't matter if you say it or not,

597
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,480
you can leave it out.

598
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,680
You are talking about the debate topic, right?

599
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,800
The problem is bigger now.

600
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,000
You said trust is foundation just now.

601
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
But now,

602
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,800
you say if the thing is not important, you won't say.

603
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,440
Then it's up to you

604
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
whether you say it or not.

605
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,520
Not everything

606
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,680
is unnecessary.

607
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,840
If you find out later,

608
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,560
I can explain.

609
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
You can explain?

610
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,200
What are you not telling me?

611
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,200
Does anyone want to go to the bathroom?

612
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,640
I.

613
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,120
Is it popular for girls

614
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,760
to go to the bathroom together?

615
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,960
It must be

616
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,240
an ancient tradition.

617
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,400
Come out and see the exhibition at the weekend.

618
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,160
Hao

619
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,480
What happened to your hand?

620
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,880
This?

621
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,480
This morning

622
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,120
when I was moving something in the office,

623
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,600
I cut my hand.

624
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,160
There was only one small box,

625
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,360
but I haven't expected there were more and more boxes.

626
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,000
It took me several trips

627
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,040
to move it all by myself.

628
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,280
If you need to do something like this in the future,

629
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,440
tell me and Dango.

630
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,160
We both eat so much food

631
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
that we can do this kind of heavy work.

632
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay.

633
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,200
So in the future,

634
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,120
it's better to settle things early.

635
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,280
Otherwise, it will become more and more troublesome.

636
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,360
Let's go.

637
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,920
Hello senior.

638
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,360
Let's have lunch tomorrow.

639
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,960
So now

640
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,400
we should clear

641
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,040
what's

642
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,040
the difference between

643
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
going with the flow and managing love

644
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,680
in a relationship.

645
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
What's the difference?

646
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,360
Of course, there is difference.

647
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,080
What's the difference?

648
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,520
The difference is...

649
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,160
To manage love hard

650
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,960
is to be good to him with all your heart.

651
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,240
Then it's not good for him

652
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,160
to go with the flow?

653
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,560
That's not the point.

654
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,280
If your feelings disappear,

655
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,000
you don't have to be nice to him.

656
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,040
You have to continue to be nice to him after the feelings are gone.

657
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,360
That's what you call trying to manage, right?

658
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,600
Of course not.

659
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
So what's exactly

660
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,480
the difference

661
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,440
between going with the flow and managing love?

662
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,320
It's

663
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,720
managing it.

664
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,160
Managing love

665
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
is very deliberate.

666
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,400
You don't say anything.

667
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
The distinction between the two

668
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,200
does seem a little blurred.

669
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Hao, you have experience.

670
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,560
You say something.

671
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
It seems that you don't have experience.

672
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,840
I'll bite you.

673
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,800
I think

674
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,080
in a relationship

675
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
going with the flow means

676
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,280
when your partner annoys you,

677
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,520
you can lose your temper.

678
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,200
You can speak out your opinions directly.

679
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,000
The couple can

680
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,440
stay with each other

681
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,960
in the way they want to be.

682
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
The opposite of that is managing love.

683
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,800
It means

684
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
when you are angry,

685
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
you think about

686
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,920
whether you should lose your temper or not.

687
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,280
But

688
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,680
you do all this

689
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,360
to make

690
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,840
the relationship better.

691
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,360
I see.

692
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
It's a bit wordy.

693
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,880
You should

694
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,000
summarize your expressions.

695
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,640
It means this?

696
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,920
Nan Bei and I

697
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,760
are just going with the flow.

698
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
We both don't have that worry.

699
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,360
Are you sure?

700
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,480
What do you mean?

701
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,360
He means

702
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,560
he took all the grievances for you.

703
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,960
Let's call it a day.

704
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,080
We all go back

705
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,880
to think about how to express it.

706
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,040
Then look up

707
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,800
all the arguments mentioned today as well.

708
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,120
Okay, Hao.

709
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,440
By the way, Xiaoyu,

710
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,600
I have something to do later.

711
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,080
You go to dinner with Nan Bei.

712
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,600
What?

713
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,280
I. We...

714
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:29,960
Ah.

715
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
I've asked

716
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,280
Dandan and Mengyuan to play games together.

717
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,080
I accompany you?

718
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,480
No, no thanks.

719
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,240
You play games together.

720
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,560
It's good to accompany Mengyuan.

721
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,480
I'll be fine on my own.

722
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,880
What?

723
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,920
Mengyuan went to cry under Jingwen's dormitory again?

724
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,920
Tonight

725
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
we should prepare a pair of

726
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,760
earplugs.

727
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,680
Fine.

728
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,360
Hello?

729
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,760
Hello.

730
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,880
Where are you?

731
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,080
Have you started playing games?

732
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,880
Why do you ask this?

733
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,320
Are you missing me?

734
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,040
Kind of.

735
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,680
Are you in the dorm?

736
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,920
If you miss me,

737
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,920
I can have lunch with you.

738
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,760
Okay.

739
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,560
If you can come to me

740
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,360
in five seconds,

741
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,160
I'll buy you a meal.

742
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:29,920
Okay.

743
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,520
Five.

744
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
Okay for what?

745
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,200
Four.

746
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,440
It seems that

747
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,480
you know where I am.

748
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,000
Two.

749
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,600
One.

750
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
Surprise!

751
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,360
The old altar pickled beef noodles.

752
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,960
It seems good.

753
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,480
You track me?

754
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I haven't tracked you.

755
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,720
It's love that guides me.

756
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,120
Come on.

757
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,640
This one.

758
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,200
What do you want to eat?

759
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,800
Anything is okay.

760
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,360
You order.

761
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,560
Waiter.

762
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,560
Where's the bathroom?

763
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,160
Go out and turn left.

764
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,800
Okay.

765
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,680
I go to the bathroom, Nan Bei.

766
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,160
Senior.

767
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,560
Here I am.

768
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,040
This way. This way.

769
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,840
Didn't we agree

770
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,960
to eat at the place next door?

771
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,280
The one next door is not as good as this one.

772
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
You're still

773
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,160
as surprising as ever.

774
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,200
Order now.

775
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,400
Senior

776
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
Take your time.

777
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,600
I want to tell you one thing first.

778
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
We can talk about it

779
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
during eating.

780
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,280
No.

781
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,200
I tell you first.

782
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,000
When you were abroad,

783
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,520
I...

784
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,800
Come on.

785
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,680
When you were abroad,

786
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,440
and after I go to university,

787
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,320
in fact, I have...

788
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,360
Where are you?

789
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,800
Are you okay?

790
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,040
The dishes are ready. Hurry up.

791
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,400
The dishes are getting cold. I'm coming for you.

792
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,240
Waiter.

793
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,840
Where's

794
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,360
the bathroom?

795
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,960
Go out and turn right.

796
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,080
Okay. Thanks.

797
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,960
Senior, I go to the bathroom first.

798
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,000
I'll tell you the thing later.

799
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,560
Which bathroom takes you such a long time?

800
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Did you come back to school?

801
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,600
I went to the bathroom in school.

802
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,480
The bathroom here

803
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,560
looks terrible.

804
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,880
So I came back to school

805
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,480
and go to the bathroom there.

806
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,640
Eat now.

807
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,680
Noodles are not ready.

808
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,160
Okay.

809
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,040
Oh my!

810
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
I left something in the bathroom.

811
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,280
I go to take it.

812
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,840
I'll come back soon.

813
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,280
What is it?

814
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Something you don't know.

815
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,080
Senior

816
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,680
You're back.

817
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,200
The dishes are ready. Eat now.

818
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,200
You are so kind.

819
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,520
I really

820
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,840
want to tell you one thing.

821
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,400
3760. Thanks.

822
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,800
Xiaoyu, what's the matter?

823
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,680
My neck is a bit twisted.

824
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,800
Xiaoyu

825
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,000
Xiaoyu

826
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,680
Xiaoyu

827
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,120
Hello, Shui. What a coincidence.

828
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,760
Why do you ignore me?

829
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
This is my senior. This is Shui.

830
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,440
This is Shui. This is my senior.

831
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,080
Hello.

832
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,520
I...

833
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,680
I come here for take-away.

834
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,200
Is there anything else?

835
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,760
It's too late. I have to go.

836
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Hello. 4123 take-away.

837
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,120
Shui, why are you here?

838
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,360
Nan Bei

839
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,000
Why are you here?

840
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,240
I wait for Xiaoyu to have lunch together.

841
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,400
Well.

842
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,400
Where's Xiaoyu?

843
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,520
She went to bathroom to take things.

844
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,880
Nan Bei

845
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,840
I decide to tell you one thing.

846
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,720
Xiaoyu, I have told you last time

847
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,520
that I came back

848
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,960
for one person this time.

849
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,640
I want you to help me pursue one person.

850
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,280
I have got a boyfriend.

851
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,680
Well, congratulations.

852
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,000
We can have dinner sometime.

853
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,520
What's wrong?

854
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,600
Nothing.

855
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,160
Well. Senior.

856
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,000
Which girl do you like?

857
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,640
An opponent I met in high school

858
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
when I went out to debate.

859
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,280
We have been chatting on WeChat since then.

860
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,760
And we have also gone out for dinner together.

861
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,280
I originally planned to make a confession.

862
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,240
But

863
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,240
I planned to study abroad.

864
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,560
So there's nothing more.

865
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,600
So you come back this time

866
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,240
for making a confession?

867
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,920
But

868
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,360
I don't know how to confess.

869
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,400
And I don't know her thought.

870
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,920
By the way,

871
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,280
you have seen her.

872
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,800
Before I study abroad,

873
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,840
I took her to the KFC

874
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
where you worked.

875
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,760
I remembered.

876
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,680
Her name is Weiwei.

877
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,800
She is the leader of my debate team.

878
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,000
Then you must

879
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,880
take advantage of this opportunity.

880
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,080
Don't worry, senior.

881
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,080
If you need me,

882
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll try my best to help you.

883
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,640
But when thing is done,

884
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,680
you should treat me a big meal.

885
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,600
Of course.

886
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
And you can take your boyfriend. That's great.

887
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,640
Mu Xiaoyu. What are you doing?

888
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,680
This is?

889
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
I'm her boyfriend.

890
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,640
Yes.

891
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:08,920
Senior

892
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,480
This is

893
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,160
my boyfriend Nan Bei

894
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,240
that I mentioned just now.

895
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,840
This is my senior from high school, Gong Chen,

896
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,600
who has returned from abroad.

897
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,680
Come on. Let's eat together.

898
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,840
No, thanks.

899
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,400
I have a table of food next door.

900
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,080
How did you get tickets

901
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,720
to this exhibition?

902
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,840
I've heard that tickets are sold out before the year.

903
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,520
None of my classmates got it.

904
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,320
Well.

905
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:34,960
My

906
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,440
friend gave me.

907
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,480
Take a look, beauty.

908
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,280
This is a unique version.

909
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,200
I had a hard time getting it.

910
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,880
And it's the only one in the exhibition.

911
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,480
How did you get this set of comics?

912
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,680
It's out of print.

913
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,560
And this set of comics is not popular.

914
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,280
This is a treasure for others

915
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,280
but not for me.

916
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,800
When it was published,

917
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,400
no one even bought his comic.

918
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,040
But I liked it at first sight.

919
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,880
I bought dozens of them.

920
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,640
I've had them in my collection for five or six years.

921
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
I am now selling it for fifty times its price.

922
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,640
I don't have that much money.

923
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,120
I'll buy it when I've saved up enough money.

924
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,880
Do I scan this QR code?

925
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,040
Okay now.

926
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,800
Consider that I borrowed it from you.

927
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,720
I will return the mortgage to you.

928
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,120
Just pay it back with your puffs,

929
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,080
and biscuits.

930
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,880
Okay, you can have as much as you want.

931
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,040
This exhibition will only be held for a few days.

932
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,680
There's no other place to buy it

933
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,360
after this exhibition.

934
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,600
And this comic

935
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,960
is really rare.

936
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,560
You are very discerning.

937
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm a comics student myself.

938
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
It's great that you draw comics.

939
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
But the hard part

940
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,560
is finding an editor with a discerning eye.

941
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,840
Otherwise, there is no chance

942
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,880
for a good painting.

943
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,200
This cartoonist

944
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,600
wouldn't have had to suffer for so many years

945
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
if he had met his good judge of talent in his early years.

946
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Let's go and see something else.

947
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Okay.

948
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,280
I know

949
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,560
it seems that

950
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,320
there's something.

951
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,800
But I tell you

952
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,640
there's nothing.

953
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,560
If nothing is going on,

954
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,880
why didn't you tell me?

955
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,520
I'm afraid you'll be angry if I tell you.

956
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
If nothing is going on,

957
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,160
why are you afraid I'll be angry?

958
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,600
I'm afraid you'll think too much of it.

959
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,200
If there's nothing,

960
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,240
what am I thinking about?

961
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,560
Shui

962
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,840
Where's Wangwang?

963
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,560
My son.

964
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
You mom runs away with others.

965
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,880
Where's my son?

966
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
He's always been there.

967
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,760
Xiwang

968
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Xiwang

969
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,160
What are you doing?

970
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,800
Xiwang

971
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,600
Xiwang

972
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,800
Xiwang

973
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,440
Xiwang

974
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,160
Xiwang

975
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,000
Xiwang

976
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,480
Xiwang

977
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,600
It's great that you draw comics.

978
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,400
But the hard part

979
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,600
is finding an editor with a discerning eye.

980
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,880
Otherwise, there is no chance

981
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,000
for a good painting.

982
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,280
This cartoonist

983
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,600
wouldn't have had to suffer for so many years

984
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,160
if he had met his good judge of talent in his early years.

985
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,960
Hello, dad.

986
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,080
My girl. What are you doing?

987
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,960
You may not believe me.

988
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,400
I'm studying.

989
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
You are studying?

990
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,800
You are waiting for dinner

991
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,320
or midnight snack?

992
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,880
No.

993
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,120
I'm

994
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,680
filling the professional forms.

995
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,080
Girl

996
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,080
In fact, as long as you are confident

997
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,240
and sure of yourself,

998
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
dad is all for you.

999
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,840
Although you're a little overconfident,

1000
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,080
a little over-optimistic,

1001
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,960
and a little whimsical,

1002
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,960
I...

1003
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,240
Well. Well. Well. I see.

1004
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,360
Alright. Eat more for dinner.

1005
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,960
Don't starve yourself.

1006
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,600
And said I mistreat you.

1007
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,040
Dad

1008
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,960
I decide to

1009
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,880
choose an editor.

1010
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,000
Alright.

1011
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,400
Girl

1012
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,280
Do you have money for a big dinner this weekend?

1013
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,960
I'll give you some more money.

1014
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,640
Great. I want five hundred yuan.

1015
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,560
Okay.

1016
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,440
Five hundred yuan.

1017
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,880
You're back, dorm chief.

1018
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,080
Stop Mengyuan please.

1019
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,000
The dorm next door

1020
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,680
is going to sue us for disturbance.

1021
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Well. Another one.

1022
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,560
What's wrong with you?

1023
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,880
I lost my girlfriend and I lost my duck.

1024
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,240
Why don't I take you

1025
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,040
to sing with me tonight?

1026
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
You'll be better after singing.

1027
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,400
What do you think?

1028
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,560
That's great.

1029
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,480
You can also take Mengyuan with you.

1030
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,360
Then I'll have a good dream.

1031
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,880
Are you still our friend?

1032
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,040
Well. Your story

1033
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,280
has no ups and downs. It's boring.

1034
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,920
I ask you,

1035
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,440
you don't really suspect Xiaoyu, do you?

1036
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,080
I don't really suspect her.

1037
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,720
But

1038
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,200
the way she handled the matter

1039
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,120
was awful.

1040
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,160
She didn't even think about

1041
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,080
how much

1042
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,600
this thing was hurting me.

1043
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,240
If Jingwen hadn't broken up with me,

1044
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,120
I would have done anything for her.

1045
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,920
Is that Xiaoyu?

1046
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,880
No.

1047
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,040
Hello.

1048
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,800
What took you so long to call me?

1049
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
Forgetting your old love when you have a new one.

1050
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,360
Right?

1051
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,880
Well.

1052
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,920
Okay. Then...

1053
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,640
Then

1054
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,200
I'll order you a room in a couple of days.

1055
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,560
Okay. I'll pick you up.

1056
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah.

1057
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,800
Oh.

1058
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,160
Who is it?

1059
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,840
My childhood friend.

1060
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,560
He said he was coming to see me in a couple of days.

1061
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,880
I see.

1062
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,080
You see what? It's a man.

1063
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,560
If you don't tell Xiaoyu,

1064
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,880
how does she know it's a man,

1065
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,720
right?

1066
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,200
I'll do the same thing

1067
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,880
that she has done to me.

1068
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,840
The power finally ran out.

1069
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,240
We are liberated.
