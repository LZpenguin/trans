She's not usually like this.

75

She's forced to get married,

76
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,171
so she can only...

77
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:48,850
I'm a writer.

78
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,370

Baiwan

80
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,810
I don't want to get married.

81

I'm happy with

82
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:56,850
writing novels.

83
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,850
Why do I have to marry

84
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,451
a man I haven't ever seen?

85
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,690
But Taoyuan Valley is a notable family

86
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,491
in the martial arts world.

87
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,530
Mr Yu

88
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,891
is the only young master.

89
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,370
That's awful.

90
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,970
In novels,

91
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,370
such person is definitely

92
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:14,571
foppish

93
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,891
and unfaithful.

94
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,891
If I marry him,

95
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:23,211
he must stay out all night

96
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:24,250
with other women,

97
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,491
gamble

98
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,211
and even hit me.

99
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,690
That's too much.

100
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:29,970
It's far more than that.

101
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,331
He must have a

102
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,410
vicious mother,

103
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:36,410
who will ask me to

104
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:37,571
learn needlework late at night,

105
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:38,930
often hit me

106
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:40,211
and give me no food.

107
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,731
Before long,

108
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:44,331
I will

109
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,850
die in his home.

110
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,211
Stop.

111
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,331
Miss

112
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,490
Actually, I have an idea already.

113
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:56,410
Really?

114
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,530
You've had a long day

115
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:03,691
from Taoyuan Valley.

116
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,931
Good job.

117
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:06,691
Mr Jin

118
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,650
I come here for my marriage.

119
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,090
with great sincerity.

120
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:12,490
But Miss Jin

121
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,850
doesn't want to see me.

122
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,131
She must be dissatisfied

123
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:15,811
with me.

124
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:16,730
No, no, no.

125
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,451
How could she... Well...

126
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:19,490
Of course, no.

127
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,131
Here comes the Miss.

128
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:22,970
She is here.

129
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,331
What are you doing?

130
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,451
He's handsome.

131
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:46,290
Right.

132
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:47,850
No.

133
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:48,850
Didn't you just say he would

134
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:49,970
gamble and hit you?

135
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,170
No.

136
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,331
Handsome guys don't hit their wives.

137
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,090
You know nothing.

138
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,131
You will know

139
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:55,691
when you meet your Mr Right.

140
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:57,331
Jin Muqiu

141
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,170
What's

142
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,451
wrong with your face?

143
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,530
It doesn't matter.

144
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,850
Miss Jin

145
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:04,650
is willing to see me

146
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:05,650
with such a face.

147
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:06,730
She's so sincere.

148
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,371
But we people from Taoyuan Valley

149
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,610
never force others.

150
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,490
So I want to formally ask

151
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,571
if Miss Jin

152
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:12,850
wants to

153
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:13,931
marry me?

154
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,050
Yes, I do.

155
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,771
She said yes

156
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:25,650
so quickly.

157
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,290
Five years ago,

158
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,891
she saved me who lost all the memory.

159
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,011
She's my saviour.

160
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:32,931
But I can't buy a proper dowry

161
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,050
for her.

162
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:37,850
No.

163
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,050
Mind your step.

164
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,211
No.

165
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,170
Mr Jin

166
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:42,891
It's just a canon.

00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:02,290
[left the Escort Agency.]

180
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:04,850
[But in order to buy a dowry for her,]

181
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,891
[I'm willing to do it.]

182
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,170
[I thought it was]

183
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,290
[an ordinary Buddhist scripture.]

184
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,290
[But I didn't expect]

185
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,170
[I'll be caught into an adventure]

186
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,650
[of love and hate]

187
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,730
[and with flashes and shadows of swords.]

188
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm coming,

189
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:34,050
the martial arts world.

190
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,290
Sugar-coated haws.

191
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,571
Good.

192
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,170
Miss

193
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,530
Do you want a sugar-coated haw?

194
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,610
No.

195
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,691
Sugar-coated haws.

196
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,931
Sugar-coated haws.

197
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,850
Good.

198
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,211
Bravo.

199
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:04,090
Bravo.

200
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,211
So this is the martial arts world.

201
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:12,490
There's no difference.

202
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,891
Bravo.

203
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:16,571
Mr Qu

204
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,371
Mr Qu

205
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,490
Mr Qu is playing the guqin.

206
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,451
Let's go. Hurry up.

207
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,571
Mr Qu

208
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:24,530
Is he famous?

209
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,050
Look at him.

210
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,530
Mr Qu is so handsome.

211
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:32,571
Yes, look at him.

212
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,771
He has such a handsome face

213
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,530
and is skillful in playing the instrument.

214
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,850
That's too much.

215
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,290
He's so handsome.

216
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:46,290
Excuse me.

217
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:53,530
He's

218
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,451
a hero

219
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,410
from Qiu Qiuer's novel.

220
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,530
Exactly.

221
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:05,691
Is he

222
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,211
smiling at me?

223
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,250
Miss?

224
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,171
He's smiling at me.

225
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,010
Miss, you block our view.

226
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:19,730
Sorry, sorry.

227
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,890
I'll sit here.

228
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,970
He's smiling at me.

229
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:36,130
She has the canon.

230
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,850
We have to rob it.

231
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,490
She's just a girl.

232
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,850
After getting the canon,

233
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,490
we can have fun with her.

234
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,770
What's wrong with you?

235
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,370
Who did that?

236
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,890
Come out.

237
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:01,890
I'll kill you.

238
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:03,531
What are you looking at?

239
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,010
Get away from here.

240
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:07,171
What are you looking at?

241
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,770
They're listening to my music silently.

242
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,730
Why are you so noisy?

243
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,010
You're so rude.

244
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,411
You are just a performer in the street.

245
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:16,770
Leave me alone.

246
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,890
I'll smash your instrument.

247
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,010
Stop.

248
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,610
You're rude at first.

249
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:24,250
How dare you hit him?

250
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,970
Bro

251
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,451
I...

252
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,090
We should be careful.

253
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,651
Let's go.

254
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:46,691
Thank you for upholding justice.

255
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,250
You are welcome.

256
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,090
We can help out

257
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,850
when going out.

258
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:54,171
It's my duty.

259
00:11:58,171 --> 00:11:59,331
I'm Qu Jinyu.

260
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,531
You are?

261
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,850
I'm Jin Baiwan

262
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,090
from Jin's Escort Agency.

263
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:16,250
The title is not important.

264
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:21,531
Help me.

265
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,730
Are you hurt?

266
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,051
Am I that heavy?

267
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,331
Don't you know any martial arts?

268
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,850
Why don't you dodge?

269
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,571
Sorry to make myself a joke.

270
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:43,250
If I know martial arts,

271
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,291
I was not afraid of

272
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:45,370
those bad guys.

273
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,850
Let me help you stand up.

274
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:47,850
My leg.

275
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,331
They wanted to hit you.

276
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,770
Why were you so calm?

277
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,331
If I didn't

278
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,850
pretend to be calm,

279
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,931
I would be

280
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,010
in a more dangerous situation.

281
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:12,370
Good for you.

282
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,691
Miss Jin

283
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:15,931
Have we met

284
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,970
before?

285
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:19,730
[It's so old-fashion.]

286
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,250
I think you must mistake me for someone else.

287
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,370
We haven't met before.

288
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,010
Then, do you need to

289
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,370
see a doctor?

290
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:35,490
No.

291
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:39,691
I have my own business.

292
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:41,890
I'll go.

293
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:42,970
Mr Qu

294
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,211
Maybe we'll meet

295
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,211
again someday.

296
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,610
Miss Jin

297
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,651
Miss

298
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:01,770
You lost your wallet.

299
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,970
What are you doing?

300
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:11,291
Do you want to rob my bag?

301
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:12,211
I won't give you the chance.

302
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,931
Miss

303
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,770
I'm a cripple.

304
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:19,090
I'm so hungry.

305
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:20,130
Can you give me some food?

306
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:20,770
Sneak!

307
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,211
You should have some new tricks.

308
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,130
I saw them in the novels.

309
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:28,890
Listen,

310
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,250
can you practice more?

311
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,811
Master

312
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,770
What should we do now?

313
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,331
Don't be in a hurry.

314
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,531
We'll get it sooner or later.

315
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,171
Okay.

316
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:41,811
Sachet.

317
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,171
Excuse me, give me a bowl of noodles.

318
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:44,730
Alright.

319
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:47,291
Please.

320
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,811
Here you are.

321
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:56,451
Delicious beef noodles.

322
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:57,850
Enjoy.

323
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,291
Wait.

324
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,010
It's not poisonous.

325
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:17,811
I just want to try.

326
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,970
Kiddo

327
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,730
What's wrong with you? Why are you crying?

328
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,090
It's him again.

329
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,051
It's so coincident.

330
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,370
Sis, this is our ball.

331
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,531
You're so beautiful.

332
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,171
Can you play with us?

333
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,571
Sorry, I can't.

334
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:44,651
I have to eat my noodles.

335
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,890
Go, be good.

336
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:48,250
Go ahead.

337
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:54,370
Go with me.

338
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:56,130
Stop.

339
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:57,610
He's stealing your wallet.

340
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:00,331
Let's go.

341
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:04,890
My noodles!

342
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,890
Miss Jin

343
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,730
Thank you for reminding me.

344
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,171
But

345
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:17,770
I destroyed your noodles.

346
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:18,651
Waiter

347
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:19,730
Give me another bowl of noodles.

348
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,490
Okay.

349
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:21,691
There is no need.

350
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,490
Mr Qu

351
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:24,411
You should be careful

352
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:26,051
when going out.

353
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,931
I didn't expect

354
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:30,931
I would be cheated by a kid.

355
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:32,411
You're easily

356
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:33,171
to be cheated

357
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,331
by others.

358
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:40,051
Do you think I'm stupid?

359
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:42,490
Here are your noodles.

360
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,571
I'll get it.

361
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:45,090
Okay.

362
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,090
Here, Miss.

363
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,250
Thank you for helping me twice.

364
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:56,291
Otherwise, I may be

365
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:57,931
caught into some troubles.

366
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:58,811
So

367
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,250
can you do me another favor?

368
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,811
What's that?

369
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,571
I want you to be

370
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:04,291
my guard.

371
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,610
Look.

372
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,610
Once you are with me,

373
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:08,770
those bad guys

374
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:09,811
will be afraid of you.

375
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,051
You're skillful

376
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,171
and brave,

377
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,130
right?

378
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,010
What should we do now?

379
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,250
Whatever, let's just do it.

380
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:20,571
Miss Jin, watch out.

381
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,411
Let's go.

382
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,610
Stop.

383
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:38,171
Stop.

384
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:39,010
Stop running.

385
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,691
Stop.

386
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,451
Stop.

387
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:43,890
Get out of my way.

388
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,211
Thank you, Miss Jin.

389
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:46,171
You have saved me

390
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:47,571
twice.

391
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,451
Don't mention it.

392
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,090
This is no time for this.

393
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,970
Let's run first.

394
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:51,730
Come here.

395
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:54,010
She's there.

396
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:54,890
Go.

397
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,451
Miss

398
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:01,571
Do you need any help?

399
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:07,370
Yes.

400
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,571
Did you remember

401
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,931
what I told you?

402
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,610
Yes.

403
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,850
Once Jin Baiwan is out,

404
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,571
we'll

405
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:17,890
circle her.

406
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,490
Yes.

407
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,370
And then you save her.

408
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,651
Jin Baiwan

409
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,691
will fall in love with you.

410
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,250
It's a pity that

411
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,451
I need to sacrifice myself

412
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,051
for Puyuan Canon.

413
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:30,130
Mr Yu, she is coming.

414
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:30,571
Get ready.

415
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,090
Okay.

416
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:34,931
Miss

417
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:35,770
Excuse me.

418
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,571
Step aside.

419
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,171
Mr Yu

420
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,530
How dare you rob the canon from me?

421
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,211
You're not getting away with it.

422
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,691
Come on, get plan B ready.

423
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,171
Okay.

424
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,931
This way.

425
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:52,970
They're so

426
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,691
bad-tempered.

427
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:56,530
I just expose their lies.

428
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,931
Why did they try to kill us?

429
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,810
No.

430
00:19:07,691 --> 00:19:09,050
If it was really because of

431
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,171
what we did,

432
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,211
there won't be so many people.

433
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:13,770
Are they

434
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:14,810
trying to

435
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:15,810
rob my canon?

436
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,411
Or

437
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:20,131
him?

438
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:21,810
Miss Jin

439
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,530
We have just met,

440
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,770
but became friends of life and death.

441
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,490
Who is your friend?

442
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:28,530
If it were not for you,

443
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:30,050
they won't follow me.

444
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,010
Me?

445
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:31,730
Yes.

446
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,250
Every time I'm with you,

447
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,290
I'm in trouble.

448
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,250
Do you believe it?

449
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,050
We go in different ways

450
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,171
and see who will get into trouble.

451
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,851
What is this?

452
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,411
Wait.

453
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,611
Be quite.

454
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,131
He's dead.

455
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:01,411
She killed our master.

456
00:20:01,611 --> 00:20:02,611
Master?

457
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,891
You have to pay for it.

458
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,290
Take her back and punish her.

459
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:06,371
Wait.

460
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,411
I'm the one

461
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,970
who was close to the man.

462
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:10,970
Why do you think that

463
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,770
Miss Jin did this?

464
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,010
Then, take you two back.

465
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,211
You haven't figured out anything.

466
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:16,131
Why do you take us back?

467
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,131
Cut the crap.

468
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,330
Why do you rob my bag?

469
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,451
Let it go.

470
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:20,931
You...

471
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,451
Give it back.

472
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:30,530
No.

473
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:32,490
He's not dead. He is a liar.

474
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:33,290
Shut up.

475
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,010
Take them away.

476
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,290
It turns out that he knows martial arts.

477
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:20,530
He can surely protect me in the future.

478
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,411
Who is there?

479
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,770
Me.

480
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:35,810
Miss Jin

481
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:36,891
Mr Yu

482
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,050
Miss Jin's erythema

483
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:39,970
has been recovered.

484
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:41,131
That's so good.

485
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,651
Thank you for caring for me.

486
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,171
I saw you

487
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,891
practice swordplay in the morning.

488
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:48,010
You worked hard.

489
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:49,091
So

490
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:51,091
I bring you a cup of tea.

491
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:54,010
Thank you.

492
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:56,250
But I can't drink it now.

493
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,010
Jueming

494
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:58,770
Why?

495
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,851
Taoyuan Valley has rules.

496
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,891
We can't drink and eat anything

497
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:02,611
before finishing practicing

498
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,091
the Yu Swordsmanship three times.

499
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,010
Young master

500
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:05,931
has practiced

501
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:08,730
twice.

502
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,330
It's okay.

503
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:14,611
It's not Taoyuan Valley here.

504
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,411
I'll keep it secret.

505
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:16,330
Don't worry.

506
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,851
I do the right thing without being asked.

507
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:19,091
Rules

508
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,171
are my restraint.

509
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,091
Because of

510
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,171
no supervision,

511
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:23,250
I

512
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,451
need to obey the rules more strictly.

513
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,411
Miss Jin

514
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,411
Thank you for bringing me the tea.

515
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,490
Mr Yu

516
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,330
You're a real gentleman.

517
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,891
I want to ask you another question.

518
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:34,131
Please.

519
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,691
That day my face

520
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,010
was awful.

521
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,010
Why didn't you regret

522
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,010
our marriage?

523
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:42,290
It's about our families.

524
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,050
I won't regret

525
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,131
unless you don't want to marry me.

526
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:50,490
Of course, I wouldn't say no.

527
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,250
Qiuer

528
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,330
Qiuer

529
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:55,171
Dad

530
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,891
Mr Jin

531
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,490
Something happened.

532
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,250
Baiwan may be caught into trouble.

533
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,490
What?

534
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:02,851
I got a message.

535
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,770
A few days ago,

536
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,810
all sects have received a message

537
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,490
that the canon in Baiwan's hand

538
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,451
is Puyuan Canon
which has disappeared for a long time.

539
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:10,851
Now

540
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,411
all sects are trying to rob it.

541
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:13,770
Puyuan Canon?

542
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,411
Yes.

543
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,050
It has disappeared

544
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:17,810
for a long time

545
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,290
since the Xu family was murdered.

546
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:21,451
It's weird.

547
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,891
Maybe at the very beginning,

548
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,851
they are coming after

549
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,211
Jin's Escort Agency.

550
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,451
So now we should

551
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:27,851
find Baiwan right now.

552
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,490
Wait.

553
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,810
It happens

554
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,931
when we're preparing for our marriage.

555
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:31,851
It's not random.

556
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:32,730
Now we should

557
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:33,730
go back to Taoyuan Valley

558
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,611
as soon as possible.

559
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,131
What about Baiwan?

560
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:37,810
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

561
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,490
The affairs of Jin's Escort Agency

562
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,010
are Taoyuan Valley's business.

563
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,010
I'll send people

564
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:42,810
to find Baiwan.

565
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,770
If there is any news,

566
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,730
I'll tell you.

567
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,691
Miss Jin

568
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,570
Why are you standing behind me?

569
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:29,330
I want to tell you

570
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,730
don't worry.

571
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,770
Worry?

572
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,211
Their master is not dead at all.

573
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,851
This is a trap.

574
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:36,931
Trap?

575
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,931
You're smart, young master.

576
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,611
With no effort,

577
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,891
we got the canon

578
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:47,530
from Jin Baiwan.

579
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,891
I'm surely smart

580
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,451
and handsome.

581
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,851
Yes.

582
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,691
The canon

583
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,211
is not that simple.

584
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:00,411
Not simple?

585
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,371
You shouldn't have helped me.

586
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,171
Otherwise,

587
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,091
you won't be in here.

588
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,530
You saved me twice.

589
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:08,651
Now you're in trouble,

590
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,651
I'm sure to

591
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:10,451
save you.

592
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:12,451
I didn't expect that you're so

593
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:13,891
responsible.

594
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,851
I misunderstood you.

595
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,010
About what?

596
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,290
I thought

597
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,530
you only

598
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,651
have a handsome face.

599
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,250
I didn't expect...

600
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:28,131
I didn't mean it.

601
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,570
You thought

602
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:30,530
I'm handsome.

603
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,691
But you said

604
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,091
I'm stupid.

605
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,691
How could he

606
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,050
have such a good memory?

607
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,570
We get the canon

608
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,691
in the name of Mole Gang.

609
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:44,891
If Jin's Escort Agency

610
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,290
wants to figure it out,

611
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,411
the Yu family will not be

612
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,651
found.

613
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,851
Now I have

614
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,891
this unique canon,

615
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:53,091
the Yu family

616
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,810
will be No.1 in the martial arts world.

617
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,010
I'll be afraid of nothing.

618
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:56,810
Right.

619
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,490
But, how do we open it?

620
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,730
You need to open it, right?

621
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:12,250
I heard the stuff of Jin's Escort Agency

622
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:13,330
is enclosed

623
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,010
in a wooden box.

624
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,490
Apart from you,

625
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:17,290
no one knows how to open it.

626
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,490
Right.

627
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,931
I have a method

628
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,490
which can not only help you

629
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,250
get the canon back,

630
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:24,530
but also help us escape from here.

631
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:26,091
But...

632
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,171
But what? Tell me.

633
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:29,691
No way.

634
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,570
This method

635
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,970
will make you sacrifice too much.

636
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,530
As long as I can get the canon back
and get out of here,

637
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,851
I can do everything.

638
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,770
Even if it is to get married?

639
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,611
Are you willing to do that?

640
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,530
With

641
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,211
the master of Mole Gang?

642
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,451
Saw it?

643
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:53,611
Yes, right here.

644
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,651
It's none of my business if I break it.

645
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,730
No way.

646
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,970
Then I don't want to saw it.

647
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:04,931
I...

648
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,171
Hurry up.

649
00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:08,211
Help, help us.

650
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,171
Someone is dying.

651
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:10,851
We need a doctor.

652
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,371
Nine over ten people here

653
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,611
used this method.

654
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:15,851
Don't waste your energy.

655
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:19,611
We can't cheat them.

656
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,851
What can we do?

657
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:22,611
If the wooden box is opened forcibly,

658
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,611
the gunpowder in it will explode.

659
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,651
Then the canon will be nothing.

660
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:27,411
At that time,

661
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:28,530
they won't forgive us.

662
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:30,171
It's my fault.

663
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,810
I got you into this trouble.

664
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:33,730
Now, at the moment of life and death

665
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:34,770
I can only

666
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,490
tell you

667
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,570
my feeling toward you.

668
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,050
Although we just met

669
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:46,970
with you,

670
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:48,970
I can't help falling in love with you

671
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,171
when I saw you.

672
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,050
If you really

673
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,970
are the person

674
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,451
I'm looking for,

675
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,250
from now on,

676
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,530
whether we are alive or dead,

677
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:00,091
whatever trouble we're in,

678
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:01,931
I

679
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,530
will not let you go.

680
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,250
We're acting, right?

681
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:11,050
You look so real.

682
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,570
The first time

683
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,010
I saw you...

684
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,651
Keep a close eye on them.

685
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:31,931
Heaven is our witness.

686
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,050
Today,

687
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:36,611
I'll marry Miss Baiwan.

688
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:38,490
I swear

689
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:40,570
you're the only love

690
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,490
in my whole life.

691
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:48,691
I'll be faithful

692
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,891
and won't leave you.

693
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,330
The moon

694
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:56,691
is my witness.

695
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,050
I'm willing to

696
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:00,451
marry Chu.

697
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,330
Be faithful to you

698
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:03,691
forever.

699
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:04,970
I'll never betray you.

700
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,290
My love is like the moon.

701
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:07,931
I'll be with you

702
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,290
forever.

703
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,810
[Why is the scene]

704
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,530
[so familiar?]

705
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:26,611
Whatever, I need to save my life first.

706
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,010
[But]

707
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,891
[if I can marry a man]

708
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:42,530
[as responsible]

709
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,770
[as him,]

710
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:45,010
[it will be my luck.]

711
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,730
Stop it.

712
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:53,891
Why are you so noisy?

713
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:54,931
I overheard

714
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:56,371
the girl

715
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:57,451
was marrying the boy

716
00:29:57,691 --> 00:29:58,451
in the jail.

717
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,451
What's the point?

718
00:29:59,490 --> 00:29:59,931
The point is

719
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:01,451
the wooden box

720
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,490
of Jin's Escort Agency is well designed.

721
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,490
It can't be opened

722
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,411
brutally.

723
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:06,290
If you open it this way,

724
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,091
the box and the canon will explode.

725
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:29,730
She may not tell the truth.

726
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,891
If she cheated us,

727
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,451
what should we do?

728
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,970
She said

729
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:35,290
only she can open it.

730
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,490
But she's unwilling

731
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,530
to open it for us.

732
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:39,490
Da*n it.

733
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:42,691
Do they get married?

734
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:46,651
Then, I have an idea.

735
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:48,050
Take the canon.

736
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:50,091
Go.

737
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,091
Hurry up.

738
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:55,611
-Let go of me.
-Master.

739
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:59,010
What is love?

740
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,651
It's about life and death.

741
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:02,570
Let me ask you a question.

742
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:05,451
Is there anything more important

743
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:06,611
than love?

744
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:07,570
No.

745
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,570
So

746
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,250
compared with your love,

747
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,490
the canon

748
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,851
is nothing.

749
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,851
It's already in your hand.

750
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,171
You just open it yourself.

751
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:18,530
I knew everything.

752
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,770
Only you can

753
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,050
open it.

754
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:23,611
Take him here.

755
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,010
If you don't open

756
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,371
the canon,

757
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:27,330
I'll kill your

758
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,411
husband.

759
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,091
Honey

760
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:30,770
Darling

761
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,050
Don't give the canon

762
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:32,651
to them.

763
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,451
Think it over.

764
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:39,330
Okay.

765
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,050
If I'll open it,

766
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,250
you release my husband.

767
00:31:42,891 --> 00:31:44,451
That's it.

768
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:50,411
Don't come here.

769
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,691
What do you mean?

770
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:52,730
There is no trap

771
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,691
in the box.

772
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:55,371
It's made of wood

773
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,490
which is easy to ignite.

774
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,730
If you don't release me

775
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,451
and my husband,

776
00:31:58,691 --> 00:31:59,691
we'll die together.

777
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,730
What can we do?

778
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,211
Follow my orders later.

779
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,211
Okay.

780
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,931
Release them.

781
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,570
Give me my bag.

782
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:08,611
Here is your bag.

783
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,770
How dare you.

784
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:16,091
Master

785
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:16,891
You're

786
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,651
so vicious.

787
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:19,810
What's the matter?

788
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,290
I finally find you.

789
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:22,330
Do you know that?

790
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,970
I have a good relationship
with Jin's Escort Agency.

791
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,050
You want to hurt her?

792
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,851
Did you ask my opinion?

793
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,131
No.

794
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:32,931
Go get them.

795
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:33,970
Miss, follow me.

796
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:34,611
Go, go, go.

797
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:35,290
Hurry, let's go.

798
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,411
Don't let them get away.

799
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,411
Go get them.

800
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:39,371
Go.

801
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,451
Here you are.

802
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,730
Wait, wait.

803
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,611
This is my home. Let's get in.

804
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,091
Okay.

805
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:03,010
Close the door.

806
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:03,851
Okay.

807
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,091
What are you doing?

808
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,851
Are you stupid?

809
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,050
They're like

810
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,091
two sitting ducks of our young master.

811
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:16,290
It's over.

812
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,330
Let's go.

813
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,250
Won't they follow us here?

814
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,770
They can't

815
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,211
get into my house at will.

816
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,851
May I know your name?

817
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,451
I'm Yu Chen.

818
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,570
Thank you for helping us out.

819
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:51,371
You...

820
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:52,451
What's wrong with you?

821
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:53,730
Are you hurt?

822
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:56,730
It's okay.

823
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:08,810
Mr Yu is a good person.

824
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,970
He not only helps us,

825
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,611
but also

826
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:13,211
takes us in.

827
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:28,330
I swear

828
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,570
you're the only one

829
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,530
in my life.

830
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:35,330
I'll be faithful

831
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:36,770
and won't leave you.

832
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:45,490
It's done.

833
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,091
Thank you.

834
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:50,451
Hey.

835
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:51,891
We were in an urgent situation

836
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,530
just know.

837
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,651
Don't take it seriously.

838
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:55,891
I won't too.

839
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,131
That's for sure.

840
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,611
But

841
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:01,250
do you find your love

842
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,451
since you care about it so much?

843
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:04,810
Me?

844
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,970
Of course, no.

845
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:07,171
What kind of men

846
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,091
do you like?

847
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:11,091
That's meaningless for me.

848
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,931
I want to take adventures
in the martial arts world.

849
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:13,931
I don't take that

850
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,010
into account.

851
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:18,091
If there is a

852
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,970
handsome,

853
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:21,490
smart and brave man

854
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,131
who wants to be with you,

855
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,050
will you accept him?
