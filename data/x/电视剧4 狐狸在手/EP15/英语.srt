3
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:43,540
Does it work?

4
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,500
Can you recall anything?

5
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,899
No.

6
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,859
Jin Baiwan, you did it on purpose!

7
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,899
It should take effect this time!

8
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,380
Still not.

9
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,939
Can it work?

10
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,539
Eat it!

11
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,780
Open your mouth!

12
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,100
Just eat it!

13
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,060
How do you feel?

14
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:39,100
How does it taste?

15
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,380
It tastes

16
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:43,699
unbelievably terrible.

17
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,220
Still can't work?

18
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,820
Are you sure it can work out?

19
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,300
Don't question me!

20
00:02:59,059 --> 00:02:59,820
No, no, no.

21
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,300
I just think that

22
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,619
such a large pill

23
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:04,740
is really okay for Baiwan?

24
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,820
Never mind.

25
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,180
As long as I can restore my memories,

26
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,499
I'd like try every means.

27
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,300
I'll eat it!

28
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:11,259
Hold on!

29
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:12,899
You've already tried

30
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:13,740
so many herbs today.

31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,539
But they took no effect.

32
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,259
You can't eat anymore.

33
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,139
No!

34
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,419
Not until they take effect!

35
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,499
I won't give up.

36
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,300
Baiwan

37
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:24,899
Zheng

38
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,499
I have to restore my memories this time!

39
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,539
I can't follow your words.

40
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,860
How is it? You recall anything?

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,740
I remember!

42
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,700
I knew!

43
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:47,939
I knew she could remember!

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,099
Remember what?

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,379
We knew each other before,

46
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:54,980
right?

47
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,219
What else?

48
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:58,339
Yes, I do recall it.

49
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,499
We actually,

50
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,460
have fate of love for seven lives!

51
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,460
Fate of love for seven lives?

52
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:08,460
This life,

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,819
we are all little bugs

54
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,659
of the Goddess of Heaven.

55
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,140
You are the blue bug.

56
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,580
I'm the green bug!

57
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,580
We have been

58
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,819
with the Goddess of Heaven,

59
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,980
and flying around her.

60
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,899
Flying.

61
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:20,779
And flying.

62
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,860
Well, Lord Qu,

63
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,899
it's because the medicine

64
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:24,860
has drunk herb.

65
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,180
When it wears off, she'll be fine.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,099
Flying!

67
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:28,619
She'll be fine.

68
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,219
Are you listening to me?

69
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:32,860
Baiwan

70
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,540
I am listening.

71
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,659
Wow, I'm flying!

72
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,059
I'm flying!

73
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,540
Flying!

74
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,540
Flying! Flying!

75
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,059
Flying!

76
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,180
Then,

77
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,740
I just knocked over

78
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,059
the censer of the Supreme Lord,

79
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:54,860
and saved you

80
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,619
from it.

81
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,619
I'm thirsty. I need water.

82
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:28,460
I...

83
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,300
What did I say?

84
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,379
You just mentioned

85
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,059
our fate of love for the seventh life.

86
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:36,180
And me,

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm the Mouse Fairy shut in the censer

88
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,379
of the Supreme Lord.

89
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,099
And you

90
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,980
are my Cat God and saved me.

91
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,980
Mouse Fairy?

92
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,460
Cat God?

93
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,300
It seems like

94
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,659
you are sober now.

95
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,819
I, I just...

96
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,340
You just

97
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:56,059
told me everything

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
about our fate of love for seven lives.

99
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,540
I enjoyed that so much.

100
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,939
That's even more excellent than any novels!

101
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,379
I must have taken the wrong medicine!

102
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,220
Please don't mind.

103
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
You always

104
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,220
don't really care about me.

105
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,220
What a surprise.

106
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,540
In your mind,

107
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,540
you've pictured

108
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,900
our fate of love for seven lives!

109
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:16,579
I'm so ecstatic.

110
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,900
I do care about you!

111
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,819
No.

112
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,499
I didn't imagine things like that.

113
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,259
I've told you.

114
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,540
I've taken the wrong medicine!

115
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:34,780
Baiwan

116
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,100
You just

117
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,459
accidently ate the drunk herb today.

118
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,900
And I worried so much.

119
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,900
Or...

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,059
How about you

121
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,139
just let them go?

122
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,699
Will you?

123
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,340
No!

124
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,059
Zheng

125
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,220
You used to take care of me all the time.

126
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,379
And you protected me.

127
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,499
I don't need your protection anymore.

128
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,540
If I can really restore my memory,

129
00:06:58,939 --> 00:06:59,900
I'll know

130
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:00,900
whether the Nonuple Palace

131
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,379
is our enemy or friend.

132
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,740
By the way,

133
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,780
if I am really

134
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,059
the eldest disciple of the Nonuple Palace,

135
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,259
maybe

136
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:12,660
I can protect you.

137
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,340
Yifei

138
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,340
Yifei

139
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,900
You do want to protect me?

140
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,860
I do!

141
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,220
Zheng, don't worry.

142
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,819
No matter who I am,

143
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,059
I will never leave you alone.

144
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,300
You serious?

145
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:57,860
If you can't believe it,

146
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:58,740
let's pinkie swear.

147
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,780
We've tried so many methods.

148
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,699
But none of them takes effect.

149
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,420
I don't believe

150
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,300
there's any disease that I,

151
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,540
the highly-skilled doctor Su Zhuozhuo, can't cure!

152
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,220
Yes, yes.

153
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,139
A highly-skilled doctor can cure any diseases!

154
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,139
The problem

155
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,699
doesn't lie in our highly-skilled doctor,

156
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,900
but the disease itself.

157
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,499
You are here to make those snide remarks?

158
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:33,740
I'm gonna kick your ass.

159
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:34,980
If I can't annoy you,

160
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,059
I'll just hide from you.

161
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:37,180
You.

162
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,819
Don't run away!

163
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,499
Weird.

164
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,420
We've tried so many kinds of medicine.

165
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,379
There should be some effect.

166
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:50,300
I dare to say it's because Song Jianshan

167
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,259
changed my medicine!

168
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,379
Right.

169
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,860
Changing medicine.

170
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,619
Miss

171
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,340
What do you mean?

172
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,619
Don't you think,

173
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,540
Lord Qu is always

174
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,980
not so supportive

175
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,900
in helping you restore the memories?

176
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,819
You're right.

177
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,220
I feel like

178
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,180
he doesn't want you to

179
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,860
restore your memory.

180
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,340
Why doesn't Zheng want me to

181
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:15,499
restore my memory?

182
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:18,059
I know the reason.

183
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,540
Baiwan

184
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,740
Do you remember

185
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:21,619
you've mentioned

186
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:23,100
that Qi to me.

187
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,740
He tried every means to get closer to you

188
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,300
when you were in the Taoyuan Valley.

189
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:27,619
This time he even traveled miles

190
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,819
to Tingqin Garden,

191
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:30,220
and had a fierce fight with Lord Qu.

192
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,780
He just wanted to take you back.

193
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,660
No wonder he always calls you Chu.

194
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,100
So intimate!

195
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:37,619
In my opinion,

196
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,139
before you lost your memories,

197
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,059
maybe

198
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,220
you and the Young Host of the Palace were a couple.

199
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,780
But Lord Qu

200
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:44,980
is afraid that you'll leave him

201
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,900
after you remember everything.

202
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,180
So he called Song Jianshan

203
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,379
to change your medicine.

204
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,939
That's impossible!

205
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,939
True or false,

206
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,259
let's have a test.

207
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,819
Did I give you permission to leave court?

208
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,860
Your Majesty, you didn't.

209
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:06,780
Did I order you to

210
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,939
besiege the Tingqin Garden

211
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,900
in the name of our Nonuple Palace?

212
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,660
I did that without your permission.

213
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,859
Because

214
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:14,939
I found Chu.

215
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,099
Chu?

216
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,140
Father

217
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:19,979
Five years ago,

218
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,420
everyone thought that

219
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,300
Chu had died

220
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:22,979
when she executed her task.

221
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:24,260
But actually she didn't.

222
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,459
She just lost her memories.

223
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,780
She always stayed in Jin's Escort Agency.

224
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,099
Shut up!

225
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,660
You found that traitor.

226
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,500
Why didn't you kill her!

227
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:32,579
Five years ago,

228
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:34,380
she betrayed me.

229
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,540
She betrayed the entire Nonuple Palace!

230
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:38,260
You saw her,

231
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,500
and you dare to

232
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:40,500
keep her alive?

233
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,300
Chu was adopted by our Nonuple Palace

234
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,620
when she was little,

235
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:49,500
and she grew up with me.

236
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:51,260
How could she be a traitor?

237
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,620
You mean,

238
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,260
I vilify her?

239
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,819
She would never betray us!

240
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,420
There must be something wrong!

241
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:00,540
You dare to stand up for that bi*ch!

242
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,140
It was because of you.

243
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
She got lost and suffered memory loss.

244
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,540
It was all because of you.

245
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:07,819
How dare you!

246
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:11,059
How dare you go against me like that!

247
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,219
Guards.

248
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,260
Your Majesty

249
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,699
Qingyun just spoke without thinking twice.

250
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,140
Your Majesty, please spare him.

251
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:18,939
Take him to the dungeon

252
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,579
and torture him!

253
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,140
Your Majesty

254
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,459
I'll go there by myself!

255
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,780
She wants me to brew the medicine for her?

256
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:37,620
Right.

257
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,739
Zhuozhuo said

258
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,260
the medicine

259
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,819
needs a close eye to it.

260
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,660
I don't think other people can do it well.

261
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:44,420
Zheng

262
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,660
You'll help me, won't you?

263
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:47,459
Sure.

264
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,699
How's everything?

265
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,540
If Lord Qu didn't change the medicine,

266
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,300
it must be Song Jianshan.

267
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,099
No.

268
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,699
How could Zheng

269
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:58,739
do that to me?

270
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,500
I shouldn't doubt him...

271
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:01,579
You can't

272
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:02,900
give up halfway.

273
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,859
Right.

274
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:04,819
If you confess to him now,

275
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:05,540
he surely will

276
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,819
get angry.

277
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,900
Zheng

278
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,819
You really did something

279
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:16,939
to my medicine!

280
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:24,540
Fiddle with your medicine?

281
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:25,500
I knew

282
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,380
there was someone fiddling with

283
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,180
my medicine!

284
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,939
Lord Qu

285
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,819
If you don't want

286
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:29,780
Baiwan to restore her memory,

287
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,579
you can just tell us.

288
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,579
Why did you get me busy trying to cure her!

289
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,260
Why do you three think

290
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,540
I want to

291
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,739
prevent Baiwan from restoring her memory?

292
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:38,819
Because you think

293
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,219
if Baiwan has taken all her memory back,

294
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,579
she will be with that Young Host of the Palace

295
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,339
together,

296
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,380
and leave you behind.

297
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,099
If I say you all misunderstand me,

298
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,140
Baiwan,

299
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,260
will you believe me?

300
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,500
We saw it!

301
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
You were adding

302
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,380
something strange

303
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,380
into Baiwan's medicine.

304
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,939
You did!

305
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,660
What if the "something strange"

306
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,540
is for Baiwan's good?

307
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,900
It's sugar?

308
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,540
My son

309
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:08,620
How's he now?

310
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,859
I have obeyed your command.

311
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,579
The Young Host was sent to the dungeon

312
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,180
and cruelly tortured.

313
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,180
He was too arrogant and ignorant.

314
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,420
Since I can empower him as

315
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,059
the Young Host.

316
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,540
I also have the ability to

317
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,859
take his title away.

318
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:32,540
What?

319
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:33,540
Do you have anything else

320
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,579
to tell me?

321
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,059
Please spare me.

322
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:38,819
I still have one thing

323
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:40,500
to report to you.

324
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:41,540
Say it.

325
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,339
The Host went to the Yinxue Village.

326
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,059
He didn't take me with him.

327
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,339
But,

328
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:49,540
to ensure Chu's identity,

329
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,620
I secretly went there.

330
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:51,979
At that time,

331
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,939
I think I found

332
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,339
the person that hurt your Majesty earlier.

333
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,300
His face was covered.

334
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,420
He had excellent swordsmanship and I couldn't tell who he was.

335
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:00,540
But

336
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,579
he followed

337
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:02,459
the guard of Qu Zheng

338
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,620
to save Jin...

339
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,219
To save Chu.

340
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,180
So you mean,

341
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
that person is Qu Zheng?

342
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:13,579
He deliberately wield his sword

343
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,300
to conceal his identity?

344
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:17,540
I was kept

345
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
following those canon-delivery people.

346
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:20,219
Qu Zheng

347
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,099
is deeply involved in it.

348
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,420
In the Taoyuan Valley,

349
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:24,660
he stopped me from

350
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:25,500
getting the saussurea.

351
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,540
Does that mean

352
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:31,939
he is still alive?

353
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,859
Tingqin Garden

354
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,780
Right.

355
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:36,180
The person that took Qiuer away

356
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,099
was Song Jianshan, guard of Qu Zheng.

357
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:38,859
The order

358
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:39,939
must be given by Qu Zheng.

359
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,420
Lord Qu not only took away

360
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,900
Baiwan at the wedding,

361
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,579
but took Qiuer away this time.

362
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:48,979
What is going on?

363
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,380
He's too unpredictable.

364
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,900
Common sense doesn't work on him.

365
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,180
Anyway,

366
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,420
right now

367
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
we must go and bring Qiuer back.

368
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:56,979
Father-in-law

369
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,059
I won't bother you.

370
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,699
I'll go to Tingqin Garden

371
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,819
and bring Qiuer back safely.

372
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,540
Hi, Zheng!

373
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,219
You're playing the Guqin here?

374
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,500
Yeah,

375
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,660
what a beautiful sound!

376
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,660
Those disciples can't rival.

377
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,459
My Zheng

378
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,459
is really outstanding.

379
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,739
Yes, I am that outstanding.

380
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:49,900
And I was supposed to treat

381
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:50,939
my wife well.

382
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:52,620
But, unexpectedly,

383
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,979
I was mistaken as a terrible medicine-changing guy.

384
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:57,939
So heart-breaking.

385
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,059
My bad.

386
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,579
Something wrong with my eyes.

387
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:01,500
My eyes.

388
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:02,939
No more words, Baiwan.

389
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,579
Just leave me alone.

390
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,699
Zheng

391
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,420
Actually,

392
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:11,339
you're not only good at playing the Guqin,

393
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,219
but martial arts!

394
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,260
And

395
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:15,939
you founded

396
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,420
the excellent Tingqin Garden!

397
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:20,859
I've heard that

398
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:23,739
since the Tingqin Garden took shape,

399
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:25,459
every household

400
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:27,500
has pushed their kids to practice the Guqin,

401
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:28,540
wishing to

402
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,979
join your Garden as soon as possible.

403
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:31,819
Baiwan

404
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,380
I feel depressed.

405
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:35,459
So

406
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,219
flatteries don't work.

407
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:38,780
I was not flattering you.

408
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:40,380
I was telling the truth!

409
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,300
Zheng

410
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,339
It's time for meals.

411
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,979
Let's have meals together.

412
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:49,859
My depression makes any food tasteless.

413
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,180
I'd rather not eat.

414
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,219
Why you are depressed?

415
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,099
Anyhow,

416
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,140
people need to eat!

417
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,819
Or I'll cook for you?

418
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,260
Wait.

419
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:01,540
I...

420
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,260
Flattering doesn't work.

421
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,979
Cooking doesn't count.

422
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,420
What do you want from me?

423
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,660
Baiwan, you know

424
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,620
what I want.

425
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,620
I...

426
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,620
Madam, the way you coax your man

427
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,939
makes me so worried about you.

428
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,380
When did you come here?

429
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,939
No worries.

430
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,780
I'm here to help you out.

431
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:30,459
Can you help me make Zheng happy?

432
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,859
Sure!

433
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,180
To coax Zheng,

434
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,579
one move is enough.

435
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,420
Only one move?

436
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,059
What's that?

437
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:37,579
Tell me.

438
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,339
Coquetry.

439
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,219
Coquetry?

440
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,780
Right.

441
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,339
You can...

442
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,540
No, I can't.

443
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,059
Zheng is poor.

444
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,059
His birthday will be

445
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,099
in five days.

446
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,660
But he will have no present,

447
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:00,380
and even be misunderstood by his wife.

448
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:02,500
His wife would not do that lovey-dovey thing...

449
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:03,780
Birthday?

450
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,180
Zheng said

451
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,260
I couldn't tell you that.

452
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,300
No.

453
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,059
Zheng's birthday is coming.

454
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,979
But I made him upset.

455
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,660
So,

456
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,500
you made him upset.

457
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:17,939
It's you who should

458
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,939
make him happy again.

459
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,939
Do I really need to

460
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,900
play the woman?

461
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:32,540
Zheng

462
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,739
It's very late now.

463
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:40,859
What's wrong?

464
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,100
I'm here to play...

465
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,860
To apologize.

466
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,420
First,

467
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,459
reiterate

468
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,340
the last character of each sentence you speak.

469
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,140
Men can't resist that.

470
00:18:58,779 --> 00:18:59,660
Zheng

471
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,580
Zheng~ Zheng~

472
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,180
Today's thing~ thing~

473
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,779
is my bad~ bad~

474
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,459
Please don't be upset

475
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,420
and forgive me please~

476
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,979
So, Baiwan,

477
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,820
are you being cute here?

478
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,620
You figure that out?

479
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,459
Second,

480
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,779
imagine he has a bug on the back of his hand

481
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,180
and gently scratch him.

482
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:34,259
Zheng

483
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,939
Don't you see it.

484
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,779
There's a little bug on your hand.

485
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:37,779
I'll scratch it for you.

486
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,979
Well,

487
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,259
how do you feel?

488
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,900
What feelings

489
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:53,060
you want me to feel?

490
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,340
It doesn't work?

491
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,380
Last

492
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:58,459
but not least,

493
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,420
Zheng is tender-hearted.

494
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,779
When he gets upset,

495
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,900
you just need to gently

496
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,580
blow in his ear.

497
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,539
And he will immediately cheer up.

498
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,299
Zheng

499
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,259
Your ears turn red!

500
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,259
You must have scratches on your ears.

501
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,459
I'll help you out.

502
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,060
Baiwan, you know what you're doing?

503
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,299
I am... being cute,

504
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:43,860
and trying to make you happy.

505
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:45,620
Baiwan, do you know

506
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,340
the difference between playing the woman and flirting?

507
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,939
I, I'm not flirting with you.

508
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,459
It's Song Jianshan.

509
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,219
Zheng, you just smiled!

510
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,939
You're not mad at me, right?

511
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:11,660
You've known me for so long.

512
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,860
Have I ever seriously

513
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,380
be mad at you?

514
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:16,299
I knew it.

515
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:17,739
I know Zheng is nice to me.

516
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,380
You never get really mad at me.

517
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,739
And you'll never prevent me from

518
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,219
restoring my memory.

519
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,580
Speaking of restoring memory,

520
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,420
I don't quite agree with you.

521
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,259
Why?

522
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:38,180
These days,

523
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,739
to restore your memory,

524
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,779
you've gone through quite a lot.

525
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,060
So I'm always considering

526
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:45,420
whether it's the right thing

527
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:46,219
to restore your memory.

528
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,739
Why would it be wrong?

529
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:50,979
What if your past memory

530
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,660
is not that beautiful?

531
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:55,779
I still want my memory back.

532
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:02,340
In the past,

533
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,459
I never asked to

534
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,499
restore my memory.

535
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,060
That's because

536
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,180
I didn't want my past to trouble me.

537
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,539
I took Jin's Escort Agency

538
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,860
as my new home.

539
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,380
But,

540
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,380
if

541
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,539
I don't restore my memory now,

542
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,820
I can't solve those puzzles.

543
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
I can never know

544
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,299
who I really am.

545
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,900
I can never

546
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,900
get rid of those problems.

547
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,539
But, what if

548
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:31,699
your past memory,

549
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:34,180
or even who you were in the past,

550
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,739
pain you badly?

551
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,219
What if you wanted to

552
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:39,299
get rid of your past?

553
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,699
No matter how

554
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:41,660
my past would be,

555
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,779
that's mine.

556
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:45,820
I can't throw it away.

557
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,100
Zheng

558
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,100
I believe, if it were you,

559
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,060
you would not appreciate

560
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,060
someone who can't

561
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:55,219
face herself.

562
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,580
So,

563
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,060
even if I restore my memory

564
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:02,939
and remember who I am,

565
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,299
nothing would be different

566
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,340
from now.

567
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,979
Trust me, will you?

568
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,420
Lord of Valley Junior

569
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,699
It, it is...

570
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:27,299
On our way here,

571
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,820
I've heard that Nonuple Palace

572
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
had a huge fight with Tingqin Garden

573
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,420
the other days.

574
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,779
It seems like

575
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,060
rumors are true.

576
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:33,779
So,

577
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:35,539
Qu Zheng took away Muqiu,

578
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,739
because he wanted to threaten

579
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:38,340
Jin's Escort Agency and the Taoyuan Valley

580
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:39,660
to compete with the other martial schools?

581
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:40,820
If so, I can't keep Qiuer

582
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,340
in such a dangerous place.

583
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,459
Who's that out there?

584
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,900
I'm Yu Linfeng, Young Master of the Taoyuan Valley.

585
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:50,939
Go ask Qu Zheng

586
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,779
to release my wife Jin Muqiu!

587
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,180
Yu Linfeng

588
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,420
He came here?

589
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,299
Since Mr Yu has come to pick you,

590
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,299
I can spare a carriage

591
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:00,380
to send you back.

592
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,459
Baiwan

593
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:03,660
What do you think?

594
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:08,939
It's you two's stuff.

595
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,060
I'm not in charge.

596
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,499
Okay.

597
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm not going back.

598
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,180
Miss

599
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,660
Mr Yu has traveled so far for you.

600
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,660
Are you really not coming back?

601
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,539
Taoyuan Valley has so many rules.

602
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,060
I feel so restricted.

603
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:26,900
I'm not going back.

604
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,140
This

605
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,060
needs your thorough consideration.

606
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:30,900
I've decided.

607
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,380
I'm not going back.

608
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,340
She's not going back?

609
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,979
Mr Yu, don't worry.

610
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,499
Mrs. Yu is all good

611
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,259
in our Tingqin Garden.

612
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:38,539
It's just,

613
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,860
she doesn't want to go back to the Taoyuan Valley with you.

614
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,939
You're lying!

615
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,620
Miss Jin

616
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:43,979
No, I mean, Mrs. Yu.

617
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:45,180
Mrs. Yu was clearly

618
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:45,979
threatened by you.

619
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:47,580
Lord Qu

620
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,380
I'd appreciated you have saved me once

621
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,180
in the Taoyuan Valley.

622
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:51,499
If you can release Qiuer

623
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,060
and she's safe and sound,

624
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,420
I'll let everything go.

625
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,539
I just invited

626
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,539
Mrs. Yu to pay a visit to my place.

627
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,340
How could it be threatening?

628
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:01,699
Cut the crap.

629
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,580
If you don't release Qiuer,

630
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,620
I'll destroy your Tingqin Garden.

631
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,459
Mr Yu, if you still don't believe,

632
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:10,100
I have one more proof here.

633
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,820
This can prove my words.

634
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,900
What is it?

635
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,860
This is the latest novel written by Mrs. Yu.

636
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:17,100
It was printed this morning.

637
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,060
If she was

638
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,939
threatened by me,

639
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,340
how could she

640
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,060
take the novel out?

641
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,459
By the way, Mr Yu,

642
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,060
in the novel

643
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,900
there is a new character.

644
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,420
At that time,

645
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,939
a swordsman named Qu Zheng

646
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,779
suddenly showed up

647
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,620
and saved everybody from disasters.

648
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,499
Lord of Valley Junior

649
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,060
Mrs. Yu seemed to

650
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,219
write Lord Qu into her novel.

651
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,860
Mrs. Yu not only wrote me

652
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:43,820
into her novel,

653
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,499
but intentionally

654
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,459
described me as

655
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:47,620
a big hero

656
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,739
fighting against a shameless guy named Yu Lingfeng.

657
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:50,820
Think about it.

658
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:51,939
If Mrs. Yu was

659
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,779
really abducted,

660
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,660
would she write a novel like this?

661
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:56,259
Impossible!

662
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:57,820
You forced her to write that.

663
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:00,219
Mr Yu

664
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,539
I've already

665
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,380
finished my job.

666
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:03,620
If you still don't believe,

667
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,219
there's nothing else I can do.

668
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,380
Help yourself.

669
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,779
You.

670
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,539
Stop!

671
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,259
Qu Zheng, stop!

672
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
Lord of Valley Junior, don't go any further.

673
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,860
The mist may be toxic.

674
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,860
Qu Zheng

675
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:21,380
Listen!

676
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:22,380
Qiuer is

677
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,299
my wife of our Taoyuan Valley.

678
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,060
I would destroy your Tingqin Garden

679
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:26,380
and bring her back!

680
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:26,820
Right!

681
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,499
Lord of Valley Junior

682
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,699
What should we do next?

683
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:32,340
Lord of Valley Junior

684
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:33,539
You are seriously reading it?

685
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,620
I saw it by myself that

686
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:35,620
Qu Zhen took away Qiuer.

687
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:36,939
He can't trick me

688
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,699
like this.

689
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,299
And Qiuer is very smart.

690
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:40,180
She can send out

691
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:41,100
this novel

692
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,459
under threat.

693
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:43,620
The novel

694
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,979
must have some codes.

695
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,660
If I can crack the code,

696
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,539
perhaps I can

697
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,180
detect the traps inside

698
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,979
and save her out.

699
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,539
It figures.

700
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,660
"At that time,

701
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:58,100
a swordsman named Qu Zheng..."

702
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,100
Oh, my nose.

703
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,660
I got it.

704
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,539
Lord of Valley Junior

705
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:03,779
What did you find out this time?

706
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,499
Jueming, check this out.

707
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:08,259
"Yu Lingfeng always has no shame.

708
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,219
Now he ends up like this.

709
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,820
He deserves it."

710
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,820
Do you find out anything?

711
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,860
Mrs. Yu swore at you.

712
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,180
No.

713
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:16,060
See.

714
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,979
The last characters of each sentence in this paragraph,

715
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,699
if connected,

716
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,660
become the line:

717
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,539
Wait for me,

718
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,699
and I will go out.

719
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:25,499
Qiuer is

720
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:27,259
signaling to me through her novel.

721
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,340
Lord of Valley Junior

722
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:29,820
We've spent days and nights here

723
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,939
researching Mrs. Yu's novel.

724
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,420
And that's what you found out?

725
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,499
That's too far-fetched.

726
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,939
You don't get it.

727
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:38,539
Qiuer

728
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,100
Rest assured.

729
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,979
I'll get you out of here!

730
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:50,699
Enough.

731
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,060
He's our Young Host of the Palace anyway.

732
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,140
Though he made mistakes,

733
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:54,739
we can't go too far.

734
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:56,060
Go.

735
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:03,100
Be careful.

736
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:05,539
If they dare to

737
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:06,340
bully you again,

738
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,660
you should fight back.

739
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:08,820
You got me?

740
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,860
But I can't see.

741
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,860
So what?

742
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,380
As long as we practice hard,

743
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:16,979
we'll never be afraid of them.

744
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,739
Come on.

745
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,060
Let's go practicing.

746
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,699
One.

747
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,459
Two.

748
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:27,459
Three.

749
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,580
This arm should be higher.

750
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:06,580
Qingyun

751
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,779
Is there any good news?

752
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,140
Father said he know a famous doctor.

753
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,299
My eye can be cured.

754
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,219
Really?

755
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,180
So great!

756
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,060
Soon I will be able to

757
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,939
see your face.

758
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,539
You'll see more than my face.

759
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:17,739
I'll take you to

760
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:18,539
see the most beautiful landscape

761
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:19,860
and do what you want to do.

762
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,660
But,

763
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,499
master has assigned me a new task.

764
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:24,580
I'll wait for you.

765
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
You're the first person I want to see.

766
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:28,979
I'll pass Baiyun Town.

767
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:29,699
The town has your favorite dessert

768
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:30,539
Baiyu pastry.

769
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:31,779
I will buy you some.

770
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,539
Okay.

771
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,979
Chu

772
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,739
Chu

773
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Chu

774
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,459
Chu

775
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:48,499
Chu

776
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,340
Why are you still thinking about her?

777
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,580
That night in Taoyuan Valley,

778
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,900
you helped me prove her identity.

779
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:06,979
Did you know

780
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,380
that she was doomed.

781
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,180
She betrayed the Majesty.

782
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:11,539
She was doomed.

783
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:15,100
What if she didn't?

784
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,539
What do you mean?

785
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,380
You couldn't rival her.

786
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,539
But there would be only one

787
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:22,660
Envoy Xueyue in Nonuple Palace.

788
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,660
So you wanted her to die.

789
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,299
You think

790
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,699
that I framed her?

791
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,539
True or false,

792
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,939
I will find out.

793
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:38,219
What a pity.

794
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,660
You're imprisoned now.

795
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:46,779
Stop.

796
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,060
Go and tell the Majesty.

797
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:51,779
I want to see him.

798
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,580
Your Majesty

799
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,420
Young Host of the Palace wants to see you.

800
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,939
Your Majesty

801
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:06,820
You've been wanting to

802
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,180
to see me in the prison.

803
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:09,060
What for?

804
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:11,180
You've figured it out?

805
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,900
I did, my father.

806
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,860
I owe my life to you, Father.

807
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,459
I should follow your orders.

808
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:17,900
Last time I did that arbitrarily.

809
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,380
I acted recklessly.

810
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:20,420
So,

811
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,259
you come to admit your mistakes.

812
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,900
Because you want me to

813
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,340
release you?

814
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,499
I know

815
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:27,539
Father is still mad at me.

816
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:28,979
I'll do anything

817
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:30,340
to ease your anger.

818
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:31,939
You think I will believe in

819
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,100
your rhetoric?

820
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:34,979
You just want me to

821
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,820
release you,

822
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
so you can

823
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,539
go and find Chu, the traitor. Right?

824
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:42,620
I do want to see her.

825
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,259
How dare you!

826
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:45,539
But this time,

827
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,060
I will do it for you, father.

828
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:51,259
Oh? I would like to hear.

829
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:54,180
How will you do it for me?

830
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:55,539
As to Chu and I,

831
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:57,580
our lives should be decided by Nonuple Palace.

832
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:58,939
But she knows too many

833
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,779
secrets of Nonuple Palace.

834
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,860
Whether she has lost her memory

835
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,779
or not,

836
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,900
we can't have her on the loose.

837
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:05,219
Go on.

838
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:06,620
Before, I couldn't believe

839
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:07,380
that she's a traitor.

840
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:08,459
So I want to

841
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:09,180
bring her back to Nonuple Palace,

842
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,539
so you can investigate by yourself.

843
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:11,820
If she is a traitor,

844
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,340
I will surely punish her.

845
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,979
I will personally

846
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,299
kill her for you.

847
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,860
Fancy words.

848
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,539
But you

849
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:24,180
besieged Tingqin Garden with your men.

850
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:25,979
Except for making a fool of yourself,

851
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:27,259
you gained nothing at all.

852
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,420
This time,

853
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,340
how can I believe that

854
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,219
you can succeed?

855
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:32,420
This time,

856
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,660
I will definitely bring her back.

857
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,539
Because I know

858
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,459
the real protector of the Puyuan Canon

859
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:44,259
is Qu Zheng.
