3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
I think

4
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
Yu Linfeng is a good boy.

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,200
Trust me.

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,400
This young man, Linfeng,

7
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,640
will be a good husband

8
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
who takes good care of his wife.

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,320
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,840
He...

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,720
He doesn't fancy me at all.

12
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,320
What?

13
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,440
He...

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
Did he say it himself?

15
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,320
We shouldn't go to Taoyuan Valley.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
Let's go back home,

17
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,440
and break off the engagement.

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,120
I don't think this engagement is necessary.

19
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,840
-Find him.  -Dad

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,360
He...

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,040
Although he doesn't like me,

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,800
I... I...

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,159
It's enough.

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,600
I can't

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
let my baby daughter

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,280
marry a

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,640
foolish brat who doesn't cherish you.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I will kick his ass.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,720
Dad

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,280
Then let him like me.

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,080
Is it okay?

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
What do you mean?

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm the most famous

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,200
writer of love novels, Qiu qiuer.

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,520
As long as

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,520
I follow the designed plan,

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
he will fall in love with me for sure.

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,760
Miss Muqiu

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,160
Mr Yu

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,080
I didn't expect that

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,240
you would invite me to

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
such a romantic place.

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,080
Compared with the scene here,

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,080
the scenes in the stories

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
are so mediocre.

46
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm glad you like it.

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,800
What's wrong?

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,320
Is it too cold?

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,840
How about this?

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,600
It's still a little cold.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,440
I will get closer to you then,

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,480
and help you keep warm.

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,320
I...

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,200
I should go back to the carriage first.

55
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960
Perfect place.

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,960
Perfect pace.

57
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,199
And a little unexpected surprise.

58
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,199
It will work.

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
Miss Muqiu

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
Since you invite me here,

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,200
what can I do for you?

62
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,360
What's wrong?

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,520
Mr Yu, did you catch a cold?

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm allergic to tea trees

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,120
since I was a child.

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
Allergic to tea trees?

67
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,680
So, you can't drink tea?

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
I do drink tea.

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,040
But the tea tress...

70
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
Then use my handkerchief to block it.

71
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,920
What's wrong again?

72
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,200
I...

73
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm also allergic to perfume.

74
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,200
Then what should I do?

75
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,360
How about

76
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,680
we go to another place?

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,360
Are you sure here is a good place?

78
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,920
It's not romantic.

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,480
I...

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,360
I feel chilly.

81
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Chilly?

82
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,960
Miss Muqiu

83
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,360
You won't feel chilly now.

84
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,280
It's warm indeed.

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
Coming through!

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,360
I will go back to my carriage.

87
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Let me send you there.

88
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,400
Okay.

89
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,600
After you.

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,760
Lord of Valley Junior

91
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,560
What's the matter?

92
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,360
Which is better? Fry it with chili,

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,200
or plain-frying?

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,000
I've told you that

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,080
it's up to you.

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,440
Okay.

97
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,440
Fry it with chili then.

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Where is my wallet?

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,320
Lord of Valley Junior

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,440
What's wrong again?

101
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
Should we set off now?

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,240
I'm watching the time.

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,760
Do you understand?

104
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,160
Miss Muqiu

105
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm fine.

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,160
Lord of Valley Junior

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,880
You lack a sense of romance.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,080
Why?

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Look, Miss Jin

110
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,880
She just wants to create an opportunity

111
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,200
to be with you alone.

112
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,120
Look at you.

113
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
You have

114
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,960
embarrassed her.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,240
Nonsense.

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,920
Do your job.

117
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Yes.

118
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Help!

119
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,640
Somebody help!

120
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,720
Someone is stealing the sacred book.

121
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,240
Shut up!

122
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,720
Since you dare to do this,

123
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,680
you should take responsibility.

124
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,640
You shut up!

125
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,840
Let it go. Let it go.

126
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,920
What's going on?

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,960
Stop!

128
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,040
You're the young lady of the Yan School.

129
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,720
You can't just leave

130
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
after stealing things.

131
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,720
What do you want?

132
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,160
If you don't want to make a sincere apology to me,

133
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,400
I will make it public

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,360
in the meeting of martial arts.

135
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,160
You...

136
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,960
bring great reputation

137
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,480
to your Yan School.

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,120
In fact,

139
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,720
Miss Jin is more reasonable on this matter.

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,560
Just an apology.

141
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,520
Sorry. Are we done?

142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,200
Wait.

143
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Are you still not satisfied?

144
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,680
Since Miss Su already made an apology,

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,440
Miss Jin, please be generous

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
and forgive her.

147
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
That's right.

148
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,160
I also want to be generous.

149
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,200
But

150
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,160
I'm afraid that

151
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
some shameless people

152
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,240
will steal it again while I am sleeping.

153
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,800
So...

154
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,560
So Miss Jin,

155
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,600
what do you want?

156
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,679
So from now on, when I'm sleeping,

157
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,560
you, Mr Qu,

158
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,640
the righteous gentleman,

159
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,000
need to stay in my room to protect my sacred book.

160
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,120
Just in case that someone shameless

161
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,120
tries to steal it again.

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,279
You're the shameless one!

163
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,160
It was you

164
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,920
who tried to steal my book.

165
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
So, you have no right to judge me.

166
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,560
-You...  -Okay.

167
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,600
I accept it.

168
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,200
Mr Qu

169
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,280
How can you...

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
Guess the number is big or small.

171
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,800
Big.

172
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,520
Why did you choose big again?

173
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,040
You've lost so many times.

174
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,280
Be serious, please!

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm a greedy man,

176
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,240
so I want everything.

177
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,800
Certainly, the big one is better than the small one.

178
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,880
Besides,

179
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,120
it may not be a bad thing

180
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,400
to temporarily lose several times.

181
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,600
Fine, I appreciate your confidence.

182
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,320
Open.

183
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,920
Two, two, and three.

184
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I win again.

185
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,640
I have won enough money

186
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,920
to buy a gift for the young lady.

187
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
Mr Qu, why are you still smiling?

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
You almost lost all your bride price.

189
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,120
Bride price

190
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
is for the bride.

191
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,640
No.

192
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,560
This guy is so smart.

193
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,520
But why did he lose so many times?

194
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,040
I'd better stop playing.

195
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,720
Bride?

196
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,400
It's late.

197
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I have to go to bed.

198
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,640
Mr Qu

199
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
You should also go back to sleep early.

200
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,640
You... what are you doing here?

201
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,120
In the morning,

202
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,360
I have promised you that

203
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,640
this evening

204
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,000
I will sleep in this room

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,320
to help you protect the book.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,640
But we made the deal that

207
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,560
it was just a plan to trick Su Zhuozhuo.

208
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,560
I never break my promise.

209
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,720
It's the same this time.

210
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
Don't worry.

211
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,720
Since you trust me,

212
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
and think I'm righteous.

213
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,320
I will also trust you.

214
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,080
I know you won't

215
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
do anything impolite.

216
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you want?

217
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,200
Take a quilt to sleep on the floor.

218
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
Take what?

219
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,080
Go, go, go.

220
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,680
Never think about it.

221
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,040
Go out. Go out.

222
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,160
What are you looking at?

223
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm shutting the door.

224
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,680
Why does my heart is beating so fast?

225
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,200
It's reasonable.

226
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,720
He scared me like that,

227
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,960
it's normal that my heart will beat fast.

228
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,000
What a cunning fox!

229
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,040
It's time to sleep.

230
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,880
Did Miss Jin kick you out?

231
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,720
Enough.

232
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,800
Let's talk business.

233
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Anything new?

234
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,160
The news about the sacred book

235
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,560
has been spread over the country.

236
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,520
Now, everyone

237
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,440
is looking for Jin Baiwan.

238
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,400
The real murderer

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,120
we're finding

240
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,520
must be one of them.

241
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680
It seems that it's time to set off.

242
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Now, Miss Jin's wound

243
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
has almost healed.

244
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,520
What's your decision?

245
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,560
Shall we take her with us?

246
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,160
No.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,360
She has lost her memory and strength.

248
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,440
We can't take her with us.

249
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
She will be in danger.

250
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,360
Don't worry.

251
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,920
Since you trust me,

252
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
and think I'm righteous.

253
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,400
I will also trust you.

254
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,080
I know you won't

255
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,880
do anything impolite.

256
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,600
That guy is really a cunning fox.

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,200
I should stay away from him in the future.

258
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,120
Who do you want

259
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,440
to keep a distance from?

260
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,440
Why are you here?

261
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,160
Miss Su said that

262
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
if you take this medicine,

263
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,480
your wound

264
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,400
will recover well.

265
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,080
She won't dare

266
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
to do to this medicine, right?

267
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
What's your plan

268
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,600
after your recovery?

269
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,800
I haven't sent the sacred book yet.

270
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,320
I still need to go to Yinxue Village.

271
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,240
You will also go with me,

272
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,960
won't you?

273
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,560
Do you want me to go with you?

274
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,960
Since you want to investigate the sacred book,

275
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,440
that's for sure that

276
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
you have to go with me.

277
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,160
What if what I need is not the same

278
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,240
as you think?

279
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,040
Then what do you need?

280
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,440
It's too dangerous on the way ahead.

281
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
I just want you

282
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,400
to be safe.

283
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,200
Miss

284
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
Your lunch is ready.

285
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,520
Miss

286
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,040
Lunch is ready.

287
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
Shouldn't I be in the yard?

288
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,280
-Miss  -How did I come here?

289
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,680
Come in.

290
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,360
Miss, it's your lunch.

291
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,360
Put it there.

292
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
Why is it only for one person?

293
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,960
Where is the lunch for Mr Qu and Miss Su?

294
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,600
The gentleman and lady with you

295
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,680
have left in the early morning.

296
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,760
Left?

297
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,360
Yes.

298
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,320
This is the letter that the gentleman

299
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,080
asked me to give you.

300
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
You can go.

301
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
I've left with the sacred book.

302
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,880
Take care.

303
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,000
Qu Zheng

304
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,960
The sacred book.

305
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,760
That cunning fox.

306
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,440
Get it done. Hurry up.

307
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,120
Yes, sir.

308
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,680
Lord of Valley Junior

309
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
Did you sleep well last night?

310
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,520
We can get ready soon,

311
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,680
and set off as soon as possible.

312
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,720
Why are you pouting again?

313
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,920
What happened?

314
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,280
Did that brat make you angry?

315
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,280
I will get this even.

316
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,200
Dad

317
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,520
He is over there.

318
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,960
Dad

319
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,560
It's not because of him.

320
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,440
Then...

321
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
what's going on?

322
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,280
It's all my fault.

323
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,680
It turns out that my methods

324
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,040
are all impractical.

325
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,440
None of them is useful.

326
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,240
I'm not qualified to write love stories.

327
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,040
Uncle Jin

328
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,480
It's Linfeng.

329
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm leaving. You can talk.

330
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,680
Please wait, uncle Jin.

331
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm just here to give something

332
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,720
to Miss Muqiu.

333
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,960
Miss Muqiu

334
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,440
I think

335
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,960
this must be your lost draft.

336
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,320
Did you read it?

337
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,680
No, no, no.

338
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,840
Without your permission,

339
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,360
I won't read it.

340
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,840
I just subconsciously

341
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
saw some words.

342
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,040
I didn't expect your handwriting

343
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,880
so excellent.

344
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,920
It's impressive.

345
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,640
I learned it when I was a child.

346
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,760
I have nothing else to ask.

347
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,360
I got to go.

348
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,440
Dad

349
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,320
Maybe he has read it.

350
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,200
Didn't you see

351
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,240
my hint before?

352
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,560
I told you to stay calm.

353
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,720
If he saw it,

354
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,760
could he be so calm?

355
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
Then why he doesn't have any reactions

356
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,080
to my methods?

357
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
My silly girl,

358
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,720
it's not because he doesn't react.

359
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
It's because you used

360
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,840
wrong methods.

361
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,120
Wrong methods?

362
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,160
Why?

363
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,680
You...

364
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,880
Why can't

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,120
my beautiful daughter

366
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,120
succeed

367
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,200
my smart brain?

368
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,840
Completely wrong.

369
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,000
My thought was that

370
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
if that brat is not sensible,

371
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,520
we should go back directly.

372
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,960
I... I won't go back with you.

373
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,200
I know you like him.

374
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,160
So I decide

375
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,480
to help you

376
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,960
to deal with this matter.

377
00:16:59,520 --> 00:16:59,880
Take it.

378
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,640
Yu Linfeng's hobbies.

379
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Where did you get this?

380
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,439
The older, the wiser.

381
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,320
Speaking of this matter,

382
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,800
it's a long story.

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,439
Jueming

384
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,280
You are the one

385
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,280
who has stayed with the Lord of Valley Junior for the longest time.

386
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,560
Then do you know what is

387
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,160
his favorite color?

388
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,360
You ask the right person.

389
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,760
Blue is the Lord of Valley Junior's favorite color.

390
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,520
Yeah.

391
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,239
Blue.

392
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,000
Blue is great.

393
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,760
Great color. Great color.

394
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,560
Then what's his

395
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,080
favorite book?

396
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
He likes many books,

397
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,520
such as

398
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,880
the Book of Songs. Yeah.

399
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,640
The Book of Songs.

400
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,360
He likes reading the Book of Songs.

401
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,000
The Book of Songs is nice.

402
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,680
Yeah.

403
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,520
This is just the method

404
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,040
I used before

405
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,400
to chase your mother.

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,840
To know his hobbies,

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,360
and like what he likes.

408
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,880
No matter where he runs,

409
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
he can't run out of

410
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,840
your control.

411
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
We should have got rid of

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,840
that burden earlier.

413
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,160
That girl definitely didn't know

414
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,080
that we would go this way.

415
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,840
Why can't I know this?

416
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Even you know this way.

417
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
How did you come here?

418
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Do you think you can cast me off

419
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
with drugs?

420
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
You can take the shortcuts,

421
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
so can I.

422
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,800
It seems that

423
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,440
I have underrated you, Miss Jin.

424
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,960
Cunning fox.

425
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,040
I trusted you so much.

426
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,120
Give me the sacred book.

427
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,280
I treated you

428
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
so gently.

429
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,920
Why do you call me

430
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,200
the cunning fox?

431
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,520
Hypocritical.

432
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,200
Let go of me.

433
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,360
Miss Jin, just think about it.

434
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,360
If I

435
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
were really a bad guy,

436
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,360
why would I

437
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,520
help you all the way?

438
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,600
I even requested Miss Su

439
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
to heal your wound.

440
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,720
Then why did you

441
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
steal my book?

442
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,840
In the letter,

443
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,120
I have made myself clear.

444
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,560
The way to Yinxue Village

445
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,520
is too dangerous.

446
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,680
I don't want you

447
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,680
to be in danger again.

448
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,680
So I decided to take the risk

449
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,840
and help you to send it.

450
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,280
Nonsense.

451
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,720
I don't need your help.

452
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,760
Since you

453
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,560
can't accept it,

454
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,120
I won't say more.

455
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,760
What are you doing?

456
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,960
Sir

457
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,040
Well done!

458
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
You should have treated her like this earlier.

459
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,280
Put me down.

460
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

461
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,480
Since I've promised you,

462
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,360
I must send the sacred book there.

463
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,880
Wait. Don't go.

464
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,120
Goodbye.

465
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,560
Put me down.

466
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,320
Sir

467
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,880
Here you are.

468
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,800
Put me down.

469
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,240
Help!

470
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,320
Help!

471
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Is someone here?

472
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
We should have done this earlier.

473
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,800
It has spent our so much time to

474
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,840
treat her wound.

475
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
It's my fault,

476
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,960
because I took her sacred book.

477
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,200
However, we took her book

478
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,680
just because we don't want her to be in danger.

479
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,160
It's good enough.

480
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,640
Hope she can go back

481
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,800
to Jin's Escort Agency as soon as possible.

482
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,200
I can do this.

483
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,320
Oh my God.

484
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
Who is it?

485
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,280
Jing Yuan?

486
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,520
Why is it you?

487
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,200
Why did you

488
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,120
catch us?

489
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,240
Why?

490
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,200
A dead man

491
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,880
has no need to know so much.

492
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,120
What do you mean?

493
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,560
Your Majesty.

494
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,480
Your Majesty,

495
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
you can't

496
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,480
always be like this.

497
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,160
So I must get

498
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,160
Puyuan Canon.

499
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,600
How is your investigation going?

500
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,360
According to my investigation,

501
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,640
the Puyuan Canon

502
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
escorted by Jin's Escort Agency

503
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,160
may be real.

504
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,360
I have got the news that

505
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,960
the book is going to be sent to

506
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,200
a man named Qing Songke.

507
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,280
Moreover, this man

508
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,080
also has an extremely

509
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,280
mysterious identity.

510
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
It is said that he is

511
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,360
the only descendant of the Xu family.

512
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,160
That is to say.

513
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,920
Someone wants to send it back to its owner.

514
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,280
I will try my best

515
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,760
to get the sacred book for you.

516
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Hope you can finish your training as soon as possible.

517
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,800
That won't be necessary.

518
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,280
If it's true,

519
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,560
this time,

520
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,320
I will do it myself.

521
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,760
Are you flying with your legs?

522
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,440
How did you catch up with us?

523
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,200
You will never trap me

524
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
with your little tricks.

525
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,880
I...

526
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,120
You're so capable.

527
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,720
But after the long journey,

528
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,680
I am really exhausted.

529
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm gonna go upstairs to have a rest first.

530
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,320
Wait.

531
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,320
What do you want?

532
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,280
I just want to have a good sleep.

533
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,680
Please forgive me.

534
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
I will never

535
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,040
give up.

536
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,920
I...

537
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,360
I...

538
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,600
I...

539
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm here to take the sacred book back.

540
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Then I can't let you

541
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,040
take it.

542
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,200
Qu Zheng, you cunning fox.

543
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,000
Let's see

544
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,080
if you will come out tomorrow.

545
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,880
What's this?

546
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,800
Tingqin Lord Qu Zheng

547
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,040
is shameless and ruthless.

548
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,640
He pretends to be kind to steal Puyuan Canon.

549
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,800
It's Jin Baiwan who made this.

550
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,800
Attention, everyone.

551
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,480
let me tell you

552
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,120
why the Tingqin Lord Qu Zheng

553
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,560
is a shameless villain.

554
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,680
He is

555
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,080
a thief

556
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,040
and a liar.

557
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,360
He has stolen

558
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,880
Puyuan Canon from me.

559
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,080
Mr Qu

560
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,360
She is slandering you. Won't you stop her?

561
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,160
I will.

562
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,800
Yeah.

563
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's too rude.

564
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,800
Qu Zheng

565
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,800
Speaking of him,

566
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
look at his ugly face.

567
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,760
It's so ugly.

568
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,120
Is he just Qu Zheng?

569
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,080
Qu Zheng

570
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,400
Go, go, go.

571
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,080
How about this?

572
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,400
Is it shameful to be exposed

573
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
in public?

574
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm here to warn you.

575
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,200
Warn me?

576
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,360
For what?

577
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,840
To warn you

578
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,560
not to make up stories.

579
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,760
When did I make up stories?

580
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,440
Why is there

581
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,360
a black nevus on my face?

582
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,040
Is that what you want to say?

583
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,760
Yes, it is.

584
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:21,960
You...

585
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,000
Qu Zheng

586
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,400
You're not only a cunning fox,

587
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,720
but also a rotter.

588
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,080
Sir

589
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,920
Are you hungry?

590
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm going to buy some baked pancakes.

591
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,720
Come on and have a look.

592
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,760
The hot baked pancakes!

593
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,680
Take a look.

594
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,560
The hot baked pancakes!

595
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
Excuse me, can I have two pancakes, please?

596
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,360
I won't sell it to you.

597
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,040
I won't sell.

598
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,920
No.

599
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,600
Fresh plums!

600
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,360
Take a look!

601
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,800
Excuse me,

602
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,400
I want some plums.

603
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:57,960
Take a--

604
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,400
I'm just doing a small business.

605
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
Please, my lord,

606
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
don't hurt me.

607
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,120
Lord?

608
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,960
Mr Qu

609
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,040
This might be also

610
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,800
because of Miss Jin.

611
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,680
Yeah.

612
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,360
One of them is in white

613
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,040
with an instrument on his back.

614
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,960
While the other one looks

615
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,960
murderous,

616
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,240
like a demon.

617
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,880
They rob and kill.

618
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
They commit all sorts of crimes.

619
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,400
If they come to buy your goods,

620
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,920
don't sell anything to them.

621
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,520
If they are full,

622
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,600
there will be a disaster in your village.

623
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,000
Jin Baiwan

624
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,480
Here they come.

625
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,720
Run.

626
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Go, go, go.

627
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,440
I can accept that you slandered

628
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,080
Mr Qu and me.

629
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,640
But, you even

630
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,720
persuaded them

631
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,600
not to sell foods to us.

632
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,000
Do you want to starve us to death?

633
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,920
You bad behaviors deserve it.

634
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,880
It's all because you have stolen my sacred book.

635
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,840
I have tolerated you for a long time.

636
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Jin Baiwan

637
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,960
Do you really think

638
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,720
I won't beat you?

639
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Beat me then.

640
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,640
Do you think I'm afraid of that?

641
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,840
I...

642
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,960
Miss Jin, do you think

643
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,520
Miss Su and I

644
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,880
treated your wound,

645
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,960
so we won't

646
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,760
beat you?

647
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,400
Do you really want to hurt me

648
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,520
because of the sacred book?

649
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,720
I have told you that

650
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,000
this world is not

651
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,360
as naive as you think.

652
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,880
What if I say

653
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,240
you can only choose one

654
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,800
between your life and the sacred book?

655
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,080
Jin's Escort Agency

656
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
has never failed any mission.

657
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,720
It's my mission to send it to the destination.

658
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
I will never give up.

659
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,240
Ever!

660
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,960
So you want to choose

661
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,240
the latter one.

662
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,600
Sir

663
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,280
I will never give up,

664
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,600
even if the price is my life.

665
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,160
In that case,

666
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,720
I have to...

667
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,000
I can't do anything to you.

668
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,120
I can only allow you

669
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,960
to go with us.

670
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
There is a tea house ahead.

671
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,080
Let's go there and have a talk.

672
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,040
Please forgive me.

673
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,480
I behaved like that

674
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,360
just in order to force you

675
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,440
to give up.

676
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,760
However, it seems that you will never

677
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,160
give up.

678
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,160
What tricks do you want to play again?

679
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,320
The sacred book.

680
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,200
The way to Yinxue Village

681
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,080
is so dangerous.

682
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,840
I

683
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,320
don't want you to take these risks.

684
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,880
So I have to do that.

685
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,880
Sending the sacred book

686
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,320
is the mission of Jin's Escort Agency.

687
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,160
It should be me to do it.

688
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,000
Indeed.

689
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,640
I should have got your permission.

690
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,040
Mr Qu

691
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,960
Do you really want to

692
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,280
take her with us

693
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,520
to Yinxue Village

694
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,760
just because of her stubbornness?

695
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,640
It's me who must go to the Yinxue Village.

696
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,520
And it was you

697
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,400
who are so stubborn.

698
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
Indeed, it's our fault before.

699
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,560
Since you must

700
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,840
go to the Yinxue Village,

701
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,800
I will escort you to your destination.

702
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,800
Escort?

703
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,600
She was so stupid that

704
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,280
posted the notice everywhere.

705
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,400
Now everyone in this world

706
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,040
knows that sacred book

707
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,640
is in your hand.

708
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,000
What if we

709
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,600
meet bandit on the way?

710
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,280
How about we

711
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,640
disguise ourselves?

712
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,080
It will help us hide it from them.

713
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,120
It's so deserted.

714
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,800
Did the man already die?

715
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,040
It's impossible.

716
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,040
I have to finish this.

717
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,200
Mr Qing Songke

718
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,280
Mr Qing Songke

719
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,440
Mr Qing Songke

720
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,760
This yard seems to have been abandoned for a long time.

721
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,680
But, how could there be

722
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
such new footprints?
