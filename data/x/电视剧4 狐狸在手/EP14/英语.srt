3
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,260
What's going on here?

4
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,420
The saussurea does cure

5
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,539
the Majesty's meridians.

6
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,539
Then why is our Majesty

7
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,299
still in pain?

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,420
This must be the trick of

9
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,500
the one who hurt the Majesty.

10
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,100
He knew that

11
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,620
although the Majesty can be cured

12
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,660
after taking the saussurea,

13
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,460
it would be more painful

14
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,780
and he can't do any Kung fu anymore.

15
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,859
So that's why he seduced us to take

16
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,699
the saussurea on purpose.

17
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:08,780
How on earth can we cure him?

18
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,539
Take it easy, Lord Xueyue.

19
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,299
The Majesty has no life danger.

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,619
But if we want to heal him,

21
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,539
the Majesty must not

22
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,700
use his Kung Fu

23
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,339
recently.

24
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,259
That is to say,

25
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,619
he wants to restrain my action.

26
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,899
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,299
I will catch him

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,180
as soon as possible.

29
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,380
I will not let him escape.

30
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,899
Doctor Demon

31
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,219
You can leave.

32
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:38,579
Yes.

33
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,740
What's wrong with Chu?

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,699
It's my fault.

35
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,460
It was all my plan.

36
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,180
You have already known that

37
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,899
escort Jin Baiwan

38
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,180
is Chu.

39
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,460
Why don't you report that to me?

40
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,100
It was in an emergency.

41
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:00,580
She said she lost her memory.

42
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:01,660
I couldn't confirm that.

43
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:02,380
That's why I...

44
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,419
What?

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,539
So I was intended

46
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,100
to kill that betrayer

47
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,539
to let your Majesty has no worries behind.

48
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:09,660
Idiot.

49
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,699
How can you decide such a big thing

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,539
by yourself?

51
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:14,860
It's all my fault.

52
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,499
As the Envoy Xueyue of Nonuple Palace,

53
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:19,619
you should know the consequence

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,499
of unauthorized action.

55
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:23,979
Zijing

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
Zijing understands.

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,499
About Chu,

58
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,660
I'll save your life first.

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,860
But about the following mission,

60
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,380
you must make sure nothing will go wrong.

61
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,059
Zijing understands.

62
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,779
I heard that

63
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,660
it was Qingyun who raised the issue

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,140
to bring Chu back.

65
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:47,939
Yes.

66
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,779
Where is he now?

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,740
Let him come to me immediately.

68
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,379
This...

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,580
Tell me now!

70
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,059
The Young Host of Palace hasn't been back yet.

71
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:32,300
Baiwan

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,059
It's quite early in the morning.

73
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:35,099
What are you thinking?

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,819
Nothing.

75
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,420
So today what things

76
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,379
on your wanting list

77
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,099
will you do?

78
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,339
I've thought about it.

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,580
It's silly to fall in love

80
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,619
the way others do.

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,499
Actually as long as I am with you,

82
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,339
anything can make me happy.

83
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

84
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,540
Lord

85
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:03,899
The Young Host of Nonuple Palace

86
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:05,300
has brought many martial arts people

87
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,300
outside.

88
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,540
The Young Host of Nonuple Palace.

89
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,740
Qi

90
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,219
He must be coming for me.

91
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,260
I can talk to him.

92
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,140
No.

93
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,499
We know nothing about the outside situation now.

94
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:16,540
You can't go out.

95
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,339
But you haven't recovered yet.

96
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,260
Baiwan, trust me.

97
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:21,580
Wait for me.

98
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,580
Let's go.

99
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,260
Today, I am here on behalf of

100
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,420
the Nonuple Palace.

101
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,700
Let Qu Zheng hand over

102
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,099
the disciple of my palace, Chu.

103
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,059
Chu?

104
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,420
But in our Tingqin Garden,

105
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,659
it seems that there's no such person.

106
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:42,540
Still pretending?

107
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,540
Chu is

108
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,700
Jin Baiwan of Jin's Escort Agency.

109
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:45,819
We are here this time,

110
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,180
not only on behalf of the Alliance of Martial Arts

111
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:48,460
to help the Nonuple Palace,

112
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,460
but also want to

113
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,219
ask the Lord for an explanation.

114
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:50,779
Explanation?

115
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:53,059
What explanation?

116
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:53,860
Of course it's why he knocked

117
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:54,660
all of us down at the

118
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,139
wedding night in Taoyuan Valley.

119
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,540
Yes, that's right!

120
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,540
Explanation! Explanation!

121
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,180
That's right!

122
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,780
Explanation!

123
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,139
Is that rumor true

124
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,579
that Qu Zheng replaced

125
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,340
the Puyuan Canon in secret?

126
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,860
So that's why he robbed the escort,

127
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,300
Chu.

128
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,459
The Young Host of Palace is right.

129
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,499
Things must be like this.

130
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,699
Nonsense.

131
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,220
Lord Qu isn't

132
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,059
a person like this.

133
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,459
Su Zhuozhuo?

134
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,900
Is this the Miss of Yan School?

135
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,819
Now that you know who am I.

136
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,379
You must know

137
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,340
I am also

138
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:22,139
the escort of Puyuan Canon.

139
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:24,139
I knew that in Taoyuan Valley,

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,259
you were up to no good

141
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,300
to call the martial arts people together.

142
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,699
I, Su Zhuozhuo,

143
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:30,059
can swear as Yan School for Lord Qu

144
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,139
that he never replace the sacred book.

145
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,980
But Qu Zheng robbed Chu.

146
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,379
Everyone has seen that.

147
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,379
About this,

148
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,540
Miss Su, how can you explain?

149
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,860
Me and Miss Baiwan

150
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,340
have already had an engagement.

151
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,780
I just brought my wife back.

152
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,139
What's wrong with that?

153
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,939
You always said that

154
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,139
my wife

155
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,780
is your Nonuple Palace's

156
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,579
disciple.

157
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,740
Where's your proof?

158
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,259
At that night,

159
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,699
we have already seen

160
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,699
the mark on Jin Baiwan's hand.

161
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,579
That is the proof!

162
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,300
You must be the second hand

163
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,259
of Hong Shao Party.

164
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,139
Yes, what's wrong?

165
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,180
Three years ago,

166
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,100
a family servant of mine was missing.

167
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,900
And on his right arm,

168
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,860
there was a green totem.

169
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,259
According to what you said,

170
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,459
are you

171
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,540
my family servant?

172
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,340
No way.

173
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,540
He can't be his family servant.

174
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:18,540
You.

175
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,939
Talking nonsense!

176
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,699
So Lord Qu, you mean that

177
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,579
you want to own my disciple compulsorily.

178
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,300
No.

179
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,860
I can't afford that.

180
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,180
Then let's have a fight.

181
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,379
Protect Miss Su.

182
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,540
Every disciple, listen up!

183
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,379
Put on the array.

184
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,819
My wife is still waiting for me.

185
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,459
Forgive me, I'll leave first.

186
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,139
Kill! Go!

187
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,499
Young Host of Palace, what's this array?

188
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:22,059
This is the illusion array.

189
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,259
Hold your breath!

190
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:33,740
Baiwan

191
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,220
Why is it you?

192
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,259
Not welcome?

193
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,740
Don't worry my lady.

194
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,860
Miss Su is here for help this time.

195
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:43,980
Help?

196
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,780
Exactly.

197
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,379
Thanks to Miss Su's

198
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:48,340
help this time.

199
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:49,619
I am so grateful for that.

200
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,100
Someone made so much noise

201
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,300
in Taoyuan Valley.

202
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,819
Half of the martial arts circle

203
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,420
are now coming for you.

204
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,699
I, Su Zhuozhuo, have affection and faith.

205
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,459
Look.

206
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:01,780
I provide timely help.

207
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,860
So all those people outside

208
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,220
are here for that thing happened

209
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,540
in Taoyuan Valley that night?

210
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,420
Was that because of me...

211
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,420
Baiwan, don't worry.

212
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:11,740
This is none of your business.

213
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,100
Yes, don't worry.

214
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,059
There's a special array

215
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,379
of Tingqin Garden made by me.

216
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,660
Nobody can break in.

217
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,900
Lord Qu

218
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,780
I have to say something to you first.

219
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,180
Yes.

220
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,340
Let's go.

221
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:29,499
Stop. Who are you?

222
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,939
Please forgive me.

223
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,699
I am just a little servant.

224
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:35,379
I'm not bad guy.

225
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:41,420
Servant?

226
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,579
Why do you come to Tingqin Garden?

227
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:48,059
Lord Qu of Tingqin Garden

228
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,420
is my life saver.

229
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,340
I... I am here

230
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,540
to pay a debt of gratitude.

231
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:52,699
Pay a debt of gratitude.

232
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,540
It's true.

233
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,619
This is the consequence that you still

234
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,100
do this when you are not recovered.

235
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,499
Miss Su, you come from so far away.

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,619
You not only explained for me

237
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,660
in front of everyone,

238
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,180
but also diagnose the illness for me.

239
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,620
I will never forget this kindness.

240
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,780
Don't do that.

241
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,180
You are my patient.

242
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:16,739
If you have anything wrong,

243
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,339
you are ruining my label.

244
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,939
However,

245
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,500
is this worthwhile

246
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,219
to offend all the martial arts

247
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,540
just because of Jin Baiwan?

248
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,660
Only for her,

249
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,540
It's all worth it.

250
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:36,819
Enter the room as soon as she came.

251
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,739
What exactly are they talking?

252
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,300
Hello, Lady.

253
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,819
Hello.

254
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,780
Stand there.

255
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:03,979
Jin Baiwan

256
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,180
I, Su Zhuozhuo,

257
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,739
always can take it or leave it.

258
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,900
I said I don't like, then just be it.

259
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,099
I was talking business

260
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,140
with Lord Qu just know.

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
Don't worry.

262
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,099
I also heard from outside.

263
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,540
Thanks to you.

264
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,420
Please forgive me

265
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,300
for what happened before.

266
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:26,500
Anyway, I am taking

267
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:27,819
Lord Qu's gratitude,

268
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,260
not for you.

269
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,300
What?

270
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,900
Don't you want to

271
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,859
know about your miss?

272
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,339
Miss.

273
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:37,979
What happened to my miss?

274
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,339
She divorced with Lord of Valley Junior.

275
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,099
Divorce?

276
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,300
Is it not shameful enough to write novels?

277
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,180
How dare she leave a note and go?

278
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,219
What an unfortunate family!

279
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,540
Mother

280
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,140
It's all my fault.

281
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:52,939
Did she really leave

282
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,140
the divorce agreement and go?

283
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:56,459
Father, she...

284
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:58,420
She is just a little childish.

285
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
As for that divorce agreement,

286
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,180
it's only a few words.

287
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,260
It can't be taken seriously.

288
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,219
You are still defending her.

289
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
Please don't be angry.

290
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:07,579
After all, she is my wife.

291
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,300
Now you still treat her

292
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,219
as your wife.

293
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,859
So how can we deal with this thing?

294
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,939
I will take her back to the valley
as soon as possible

295
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:15,540
and blame her according to

296
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,540
our valley's law.

297
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,260
You.

298
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,180
Lady.

299
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,660
Darling.

300
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:23,939
You.

301
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,900
You. You.

302
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,099
Never mind.

303
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,900
This is not a small thing.

304
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,819
Just now

305
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:32,059
you promised in front of me and your mother.

306
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,140
Then deal with it

307
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,260
properly.

308
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:36,819
Thanks, dad.

309
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,300
Lord of Valley Junior, news.

310
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,219
Young Mrs

311
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,500
has gone back to Jin's Escort Agency.

312
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:50,620
What?

313
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,819
Why don't you tell this

314
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:53,780
to my parents?

315
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:55,540
This...

316
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,180
I personally think that

317
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:59,059
we'd better not let Lord of Valley and Mrs

318
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,339
know the information of the young Mrs.

319
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,219
Did she do

320
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,140
anything wrong again?

321
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,420
No. No, No.

322
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,099
She immediately wrote her novels

323
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,059
at the time she went back home.

324
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,339
The main point is...

325
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,859
In this novel,

326
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,219
She wrote a villain

327
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,339
with you to be the prototype.

328
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,059
What?

329
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:18,620
But I heard that

330
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,260
this novel sells well.

331
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,979
I've read it.

332
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,099
The content is so good.

333
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,339
I heard that they're reprinting it everywhere.

334
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,739
Even the price of paper has raised up.

335
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,859
This is nonsense.

336
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,099
Prepare the horse.
Let's go to the Jin's Escort Agency.

337
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:30,540
Yes.

338
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,339
Miss likes Mr Yu so much.

339
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,500
Why suddenly divorced?

340
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,260
Something must happened.

341
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,420
I have to go back and check her.

342
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:38,900
No.

343
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,859
You know that

344
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,380
people outside

345
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,579
are still waiting.

346
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,500
You can't go out now.

347
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,459
So what about my miss?

348
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,819
If you

349
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,540
really want to see Miss Jin,

350
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,540
there can be a way.

351
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,260
You have ideas?

352
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:54,500
Trust me.

353
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,699
Head Escort, again.

354
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,620
Those booksellers again?

355
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,260
Yes.

356
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:04,780
They said

357
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:06,140
that novel Barefaced Yu Lingfeng

358
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,339
Miss wrote after she came back

359
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,459
sells so good.

360
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,540
So

361
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,579
they are hurried to

362
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:11,900
make appointments with Miss.

363
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:12,620
Nonsense.

364
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,540
I can forgive the divorce.

365
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:19,900
Now she dares to

366
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,300
openly oppose against Taoyuan Valley.

367
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:23,979
How am I supposed to do

368
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:24,939
to Brother Yu?

369
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
It's only a few days since she's back,

370
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,579
Miss has already

371
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:28,739
written a novel.

372
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,939
She has also improved the writing.

373
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,579
Miss.

374
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,660
You haven't eaten anything

375
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,500
for three days and nights.

376
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:44,579
Your body can't take it.

377
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,459
Miss Muqiu, open the door, please!

378
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:48,500
What's the matter?

379
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,059
Head Escort, Miss Muqiu...

380
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:52,660
Yes, sir.

381
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,819
Qiuer, open the door.

382
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,059
It's Dad.

383
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,180
Qiuer, open the door.

384
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,939
It's Dad.

385
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,859
Qiuer, did you hear me?

386
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,579
Dad is gonna kick the door

387
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,140
if you don't open it.

388
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,620
I am gonna kick the door.

389
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,540
Dad really kick the door.

390
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:16,260
I kick...

391
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:17,939
Dad.

392
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,780
Pouting again.

393
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:26,699
What do you think you're doing?

394
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,660
I just want to write the novels.

395
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,819
In Taoyuan Valley, they didn't let me write.

396
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:32,339
And now you're not gonna allow it as well?

397
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,819
Dad.

398
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:34,859
I... I didn't.

399
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,540
You tell dad the truth.

400
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,219
What happened to you

401
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,780
in the Taoyuan Valley.

402
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:42,819
Why do you want to get a divorce?

403
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,819
I don't want to talk about it.

404
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,819
Just talk to dad.

405
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,579
Tell me.

406
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,780
I wrote it all in the novel.

407
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,059
You can read it when I'm done.

408
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,339
Write and write. Always write.

409
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:55,819
Do you know how much

410
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:57,339
influence this novel has now?

411
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,819
All the people...

412
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,180
All the people are waiting

413
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,459
to see Yu Linfeng's jokes.

414
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:02,300
It serves him right.

415
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,579
What are you talking?

416
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,579
-And...  
-Head Escort.

417
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,459
Mr Yu from Taoyuan Valley is here.

418
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,140
What?

419
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,579
Father-in-law.

420
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,620
That's the way it is.

421
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,780
I burned Qiuer's novels.

422
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:29,900
So your came here to...

423
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:30,979
I'm here to take Qiuer back to...

424
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:31,819
I'm not going back with you.

425
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,540
The marriage of these two families is not a game,

426
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:38,780
which can be you left a paper

427
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:39,739
and go away?

428
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,819
Yeah, that's not a game.

429
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:42,819
What more do you want?

430
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:43,500
Right.

431
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:44,739
What more do you want?

432
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,140
Father-in-law.

433
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,380
I came here this time

434
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,540
to sincerely take Qiuer

435
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:49,500
back to Taoyuan Valley.

436
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,900
This is good.

437
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,979
I think you should go back with him.

438
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,339
I'm not going back with you.

439
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,979
I go back and wait for you to burn my novels again?

440
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,620
Right.

441
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,380
You can't burn them again.

442
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,380
Of course not.

443
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:02,939
Wait. Who are you?

444
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,339
I'm Miss Jin's bookseller.

445
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,699
Barefaced Yu Lingfeng.

446
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,819
is selling so well.

447
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:08,579
Miss Jin,

448
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:11,140
You should renew my contract.

449
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,579
Qiuer, you did this,

450
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,780
what should I do?

451
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:16,780
What we value most at Taoyuan Valley

452
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:17,739
is family honor.

453
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,099
Why did you do that?

454
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,620
I'll write it if you won't let me.

455
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,819
Sign the contract, right?

456
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:26,859
Yes, yes.

457
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
Yu Lingfeng's novel,

458
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,979
I will write it for ten years.

459
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,219
Miss Muqiu.

460
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:43,579
Miss Muqiu.

461
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,979
Why are you locking

462
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,219
yourself in the room again?

463
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:47,579
You haven't eaten anything

464
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:48,979
for several days.

465
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,339
Mr Yu.

466
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,180
Give me.

467
00:17:58,859 --> 00:17:59,540
Qiuer.

468
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,059
The body, hair and skin are from parents.

469
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,500
You can't ruin your health

470
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:04,660
just because you're angry.

471
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,300
Mr Yu needn't meddle in my affairs.

472
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:07,540
Why do you have to be angry

473
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,900
regardless of the consequences?

474
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,979
OK.

475
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:13,540
I promise you

476
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,540
as long as you come back to Taoyuan Valley with me

477
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:16,620
and apologize to parents,

478
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,900
I, as your husband,

479
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:18,819
will naturally help you

480
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:19,739
bear all this.

481
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:21,979
Qiuer.

482
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,059
I apologize to parents?

483
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,380
So, until now,

484
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,339
you don't think you and your mother

485
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:30,900
did anything wrong

486
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,500
in burning my novels, right?

487
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:33,939
I admit that

488
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
my mother's burning the novels

489
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,859
was a bit aggressive.

490
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,540
But she did this

491
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:40,620
for your benefit.

492
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,739
She wants you

493
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:43,259
to become a real leader of family.

494
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:44,820
As for your novels,

495
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,979
they are vulgar anyway.

496
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:46,580
How can the novels

497
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,660
be vulgar?

498
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Everybody loves it.

499
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:49,820
Qiuer.

500
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:52,820
You and I are married.

501
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,420
You are a member of our Taoyuan Valley.

502
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,739
Your style,

503
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,180
of course, can't be as unruly

504
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,299
as you used to be.

505
00:18:58,459 --> 00:18:58,860
And...

506
00:18:58,979 --> 00:18:59,620
So you don't have to

507
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,739
be here today.

508
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,100
I don't want to stay

509
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,539
in Taoyuan Valley any longer.

510
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,299
I told you that I wanted to divorce,

511
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,580
I meant it.

512
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:17,820
Is it true what you said?

513
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,140
From now on,

514
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,660
you and I are done.

515
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,779
Just leave.

516
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,299
No matter how angry you are,

517
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,219
you can't starve yourself any more.

518
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:10,219
How sad Qiuer is

519
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,939
to say these words.

520
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,539
As a husband,

521
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,340
as Taoyuan Valley,

522
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,420
is there really no room

523
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,100
for a novel of Qiuer?

524
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:28,539
No.

525
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,259
Qiuer and I can't end in this way.

526
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,699
What are you still doing here...

527
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,620
Why is it you?

528
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,699
Qiuer.

529
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,060
Qiuer.

530
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:02,380
Qiuer.

531
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,499
Father-in-law, Qiuer is missing.

532
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,539
What?

533
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,820
Qiuer is missing?

534
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:14,420
You're all crap.

535
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,219
Rush in now.

536
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,539
Young Host of Palace.

537
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:25,860
It is not that we are not effective,

538
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,259
but the fog and the mechanism

539
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,860
are really unbreakable.

540
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:40,180
What are you doing here?

541
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,259
Qingyun, come back with me.

542
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,620
Our senior sister, Chu,

543
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:45,060
is now trapped in this Tingqin Garden.

544
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,420
How could I, as the Young Host of Palace,

545
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,420
sit idly by?

546
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,979
Nonuple Token is here.

547
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,499
Seeing Nonuple Token equals seeing Host in person.

548
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:05,539
Envoy Heiyun, Qingyun listen.

549
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,299
Leave immediately,

550
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,380
and return to Nonuple Palace to meet Host.

551
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,459
Madam.

552
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,699
Look who's here.

553
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,060
Baiwan.

554
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,060
Miss Muqiu.

555
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,539
Miss Muqiu, I missed you so much.

556
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:26,539
How did you get here?

557
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,699
It's him.

558
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,340
Not me.

559
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:30,299
It was the Lord's order.

560
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:31,420
It's none of my business.

561
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,660
How did you get here?

562
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:36,939
I missed you so much.

563
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,459
I missed you so much, too.

564
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,539
So!

565
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,380
We must divorce.

566
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,340
That's right.

567
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,620
But, Miss Muqiu.

568
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:48,100
Didn't you always

569
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,380
like Mr. Yu before?

570
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,100
It's all a facade.

571
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:52,979
From the moment

572
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:53,660
he burned my script,

573
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,820
I had completely

574
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,259
given up on him.

575
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,380
Good.

576
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,499
When I leave Tingqin Garden,

577
00:22:58,779 --> 00:22:59,699
I'll get even with him.

578
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,779
However,

579
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:03,739
You're a

580
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,100
public enemy now.

581
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:06,499
How are you going to get to Taoyuan Valley?

582
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,779
Public enemy?

583
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,299
You don't know about this yet?

584
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:12,539
Now the whole world is saying that

585
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,100
either Lord Qu changed Puyuan Canon

586
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,499
and held you hostage,

587
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,380
or the two of you conspired together.

588
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,060
So you are hiding in Tingqin Garden

589
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:22,180
and afraid to go out.

590
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,219
What?

591
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:25,219
No.

592
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,219
I can't let Zheng

593
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,499
be misunderstood by all the people of Wu Lin

594
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:29,140
because of me.

595
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,060
Go get them.

596
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,539
Sit down.

597
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:32,699
You can't go out yet.

598
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,580
Why?

599
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,580
Nonuple Palace people are

600
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,779
everywhere outside now.

601
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,060
They say you're,

602
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:39,060
what, the former Envoy Xueyue.

603
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,380
Who knows

604
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:41,380
what will happen

605
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,459
if you go outside.

606
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,539
We can't do anything unceremoniously right now.

607
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:46,939
What should I do?

608
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,939
Right.

609
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,420
I can't put Zheng to any more trouble.

610
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,820
Anyway, I don't believe

611
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,060
you're the Envoy Xueyue.

612
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,459
What do you think?

613
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:03,620
I don't know.

614
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:05,779
If only you could

615
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,539
get your memory back.

616
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,380
Wouldn't that tell you

617
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:09,539
if the people at Nonuple Palace

618
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,860
are telling the truth or not?

619
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,499
Get memory back.

620
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,660
Yes.

621
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,299
Just get my memory back.

622
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:18,420
But,

623
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:20,539
Didn't the doctor at Escort Agency say that

624
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,299
no one but a highly-skilled doctor

625
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,900
can cure your

626
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,779
memory loss?

627
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,499
Isn't highly-skilled doctor right here?

628
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,979
She?

629
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:36,539
Hello, Doctor Su.

630
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:39,539
Can I help you?

631
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,820
We do have a little thing

632
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,420
which needs your help.

633
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,299
You want me to restore her memory,

634
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,299
right?

635
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,180
No way.

636
00:24:58,939 --> 00:24:59,539
Doctor Su.

637
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,180
Please,

638
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,100
We can talk about this,

639
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,820
-right?  
-Don't drag me.

640
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:02,820
This thing...

641
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,140
-I'm busy.  
-Doctor Su.

642
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,100
-Doctor Su.  
-I don't care.

643
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,699
Getting memory back?

644
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,380
Miss Muqiu said that

645
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:11,739
once I get my memory back,

646
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:13,100
I'll know if those people of Nonuple Palace

647
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,580
are telling the truth or not.

648
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,900
If what they said is false,

649
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,420
expose them immediately.

650
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,499
But if it's true...

651
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,900
What they said is not true.

652
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:25,499
I mean,

653
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
it's a big deal.

654
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,340
Baiwan needs to think carefully.

655
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,580
Zheng.

656
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,100
You don't want my memory back?

657
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,100
I just want you to be safe.

658
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,860
Of course, I want to find myself back.

659
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,539
Don't you want to know

660
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,340
what I used to be like,

661
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,739
Zheng?

662
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:49,180
I knew

663
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,779
Zheng would help me,

664
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:51,539
right?

665
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:53,499
So,

666
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,900
What does Su Zhuozhuo like?

667
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,820
So Baiwan

668
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,620
is trying to please Miss Su.

669
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,420
Once she's happy,

670
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:01,539
she'll be able to help me

671
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,499
get my memory back.

672
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:03,900
You spent the most time with her,

673
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,820
so you must know what she likes, right?

674
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,180
These are

675
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,939
all Miss Su's favorites.

676
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:10,660
All right, I'll be right back.

677
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,820
She said she'd put on weight

678
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,820
and don't want to eat them.

679
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:26,539
She also said that I laughed at her.

680
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:27,459
So...

681
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,380
How about this?

682
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,900
Are you sure she likes rabbits?

683
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,140
Hear with my own ears.

684
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:39,779
OK.

685
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,340
It's gonna work this time.

686
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:44,739
How do you know so much

687
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:45,979
about her preferences?

688
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,860
For my wife, naturally.

689
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,060
You can make use of it today.

690
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,100
Let's go.

691
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,259
My God.

692
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,539
What are you coming back so soon?

693
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,820
My God.

694
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,380
She does like rabbits,

695
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,739
but what she likes is spicy diced rabbit,

696
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:13,100
and braised rabbit head.

697
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,459
She would have eaten the rabbit

698
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,539
if I hadn't told the housekeeper

699
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:16,979
to hide it quickly.

700
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:18,779
In that case,

701
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,539
there is really nothing I can do.

702
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,979
No,

703
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:24,459
I can't just give up so easily.

704
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:32,100
If we can't cater to her pleasure,

705
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,979
then I'll lure her in.

706
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,979
Lure her in?

707
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,259
At this point,

708
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:42,060
Miss Muqiu should take the field.

709
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,140
Baiwan.

710
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,580
Are you sure this is gonna work?

711
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,939
I am.

712
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:00,459
I don't believe

713
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
anyone can escape

714
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
from the charm of novels.

715
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:08,060
Go, go.

716
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:16,539
What is it?

717
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,100
That works?

718
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,499
It's over?

719
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,499
Where is the second half?

720
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,620
Baiwan, it works.

721
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,459
I told you that

722
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,580
no one can get away with this.

723
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:52,900
Where is the second half?

724
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,060
If Miss Su

725
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,219
wants to find the second half,

726
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:00,580
look...

727
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,580
here.

728
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,420
Our Qiu...

729
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,459
Qiu Qiuer herself.

730
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,140
Qiu Qiuer?

731
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,219
You are Qiu Qiuer?

732
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,340
Did you write this?

733
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,979
Absolutely true.

734
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
If Doctor Su likes it,

735
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,299
I wouldn't mind

736
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,380
writing it now.

737
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:20,900
I can also read it out loud.

738
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,820
Great.

739
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,060
However...

740
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:27,219
You are trying to blackmail me

741
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,620
into treating her with this novel, right?

742
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,420
It's impossible!

743
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,539
If Miss Su had not

744
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,459
read the second half,

745
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,620
would you have eaten well

746
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,259
and slept well at night?

747
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:43,140
Just treating you for a disease.

748
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,060
Sure.

749
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,620
But,

750
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,900
I want to read the second half right away.

751
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:56,739
It's a deal.

752
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,539
You got a lot of

753
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:01,660
old wounds on you.

754
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,219
And you have had multiple internal injuries.

755
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:04,100
You would have been killed

756
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,459
if you didn't have

757
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,060
strong resistance.

758
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,539
Can Baiwan really

759
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,299
be the first

760
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:12,060
disciple of Nonuple Palace?

761
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,779
Don't worry.

762
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,779
It's a piece of cake

763
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,820
to cure them.

764
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,900
But

765
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,299
there will be some suffering along the way.

766
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,060
Have you made up your mind?

767
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,340
-How are you?  
-Have you remembered anything?

768
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:57,580
It seems that I've seen some images,

769
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,779
but I don't think I got a good look.

770
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,979
How is that possible?

771
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:03,340
What did you see?

772
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:07,900
I saw people killing people.

773
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,539
killing?

774
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,299
But,

775
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,299
If you were

776
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,180
the First Disciple of Nonuple Palace,

777
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,420
you must

778
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,539
have seen it as well.

779
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:19,779
Those who were killed must be bad people.

780
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,259
Why can't I think of more?

781
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,380
It's impossible.

782
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,219
I've never missed.

783
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,699
You really didn't remember?

784
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,180
How about a few more needles?

785
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,420
You think it's like kidding?

786
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,900
Another stab would kill her.

787
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,900
Since needles don't work,

788
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
use drugs.

789
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,539
Zhuozhuo,

790
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:49,060
when will

791
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,979
Baiwan recover?

792
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,420
I, Yan School highly-Skilled doctor,

793
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,739
Su Zhuozhuo, am standing here.

794
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,539
Just rest assured.

795
00:31:56,939 --> 00:31:58,340
Surely medicine can cure the disease.

796
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:00,140
Wait. I'll go get ready.

797
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:05,660
Does it work?

798
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,180
Just believe her.

799
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,539
Su Zhuozhuo has agreed

800
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:11,820
to treat Miss Jin's memory loss.

801
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,779
But if she remembers...

802
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,180
She won't remember.

803
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,900
Why?

804
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,499
Because she has no memory loss.

805
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,180
It's that her memory has been sealed.

806
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,259
Sealed?

807
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,180
There's only one Envoy Xueyue

808
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,420
in our Nonuple Palace all the time.

809
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,340
Each has a red moon mark

810
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,779
like this on the wrist.

811
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:33,739
It seals not only the memory

812
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:35,699
but also the martial arts.

813
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,900
It's exactly the same as mine.

814
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:43,100
So you're saying that the mark

815
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,180
actually represents

816
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,060
a kind of seal.

817
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,739
When I was young,

818
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,180
I studied guqin and traveled with an expert.

819
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,660
I've seen a poison

820
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,180
called Wangyou Poison.

821
00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,100
When the poison strikes,

822
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
all past memories

823
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,459
are sealed.

824
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:02,739
Only a rare treasure

825
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:04,539
called Lingyao Herb

826
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:05,820
can break the seal.

827
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:07,860
So,

828
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,539
you're saying that Jing Yuan was afraid

829
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,299
that his Envoy Xueyue would betray him,

830
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,979
so he used the impressions

831
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:13,779
to deceive them.

832
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,699
Actually,

833
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:15,539
it's in order to

834
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:16,459
seal their memories.

835
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,340
Five years ago,

836
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,820
she told me that she thought

837
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,820
what master told them to do

838
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:23,979
was for the sake of martial arts justice.

839
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,620
She had no idea that

840
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:27,699
Jing Yuan had been deceiving her.

841
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,380
I can't let her recall

842
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,380
her miserable past.

843
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:34,699
I'm not gonna let her

844
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,100
go through that pain again.
