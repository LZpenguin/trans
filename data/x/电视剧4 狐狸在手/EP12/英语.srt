[Fall in Love with a Fox]
[EP12]

3
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,059
And this medicine

4
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,500
has to come from you.

5
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,859
I'm kidding.

6
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,899
Hold me.

7
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:26,619
Baiwan

8
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,740
You have never been

9
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,899
lovely like this.

10
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,939
Well, will it

11
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,979
make you feel better?

12
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,299
No.

13
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,059
How come?

14
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,699
You must do some magic to me.

15
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm afraid I can't be escaped from you.

16
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:48,899
So you have to be responsible
for taking care of me

17
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:50,740
for the rest of my life.

18
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:54,539
Will do.

19
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,499
So you belong to me

20
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,059
since now.

21
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,619
But

22
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:01,940
I'm ready to leave you at any second

23
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,979
when you treat me badly.

24
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,619
And you'll die alone then.

25
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:07,460
Okay.

26
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,619
Let's go.

27
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,100
We are heading to the

28
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,899
wedding reception of Miss Jin.

29
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,940
Probably could make it.

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,499
A good chance to learn.

31
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:14,820
Learn what?

32
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:16,460
Of course the experiences

33
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:17,820
for our own wedding.

34
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,139
Come on.

35
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,219
Since we've already done the ceremony,

36
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,860
how about this cross-cupped wine?

37
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,499
The cross-cupped wine is for

38
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,659
the couple who have mutual affinity and can live together till old.

39
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
You said that

40
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,140
you marry me in the name of

41
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,300
honor of Taoyuan Valley.

42
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:41,580
So do I.

43
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:43,779
The whole reason that I marry you

44
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:44,740
is Jin's Escort Agency.

45
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,140
So this wine

46
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,099
doesn't matter at all.

47
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:12,420
Brother Jin

48
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:12,980
Please.

49
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,499
Drink this.

50
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,059
It's your big day.

51
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:16,939
Go ahead.

52
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:17,860
What a handsome couple.

53
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:18,699
They're perfect made for each other.

54
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,619
Right.

55
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,459
Here's to you, please.

56
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,300
Okay.

57
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,499
Come on, drink it up.

58
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:26,139
Brother Yu

59
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,900
Brother Jin

60
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,459
Honor to serve you.

61
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:29,980
Please.

62
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,819
From this moment,

63
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,780
I can't keep her company any more.

64
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:35,340
I can't make her any cakes

65
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,100
whenever she wants.

66
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,379
It would be not the same as before.

67
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,860
You are not the kitchen maid

68
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,340
of Jin's Escort Agency,

69
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,139
but the first lady of Tingqin Garden.

70
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,340
Muqiu looked so pretty

71
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:55,819
in that wedding dress.

72
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,100
You like the wedding dress, right?

73
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,259
I, I didn't say that.

74
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:05,619
My lady

75
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,619
Your wedding dress would be much prettier

76
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,579
than hers

77
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,699
on our wedding.

78
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,980
Ladies and gentlemen

79
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,100
Ladies and gentlemen

80
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,860
All of you come a long way

81
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,579
to Taoyuan Valley

82
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,499
for my son's wedding.

83
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,059
I really appreciate it.

84
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,499
Please help yourself

85
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:27,780
and have a good time.

86
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,579
Great.

87
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
Congrats.

88
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:30,579
Come on.

89
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,499
Come on.

90
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:36,499
Please enjoy yourself.

91
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,379
The happy marriage between

92
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:43,579
Young Master of Valley and Muqiu

93
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,300
is truly a blessed event.

94
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,379
On behalf of Nonuple Palace,

95
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,059
I'm here to send my warmest congratulations.

96
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,059
It is indeed a blessing

97
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,740
to have such a good match.

98
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,860
Please accept our sincere congratulations

99
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,619
from Nonuple Palace.

100
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:06,860
Qi

101
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,660
What is he doing here?

102
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,259
This is...

103
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:25,459
This is Envoy Heiyun

104
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,900
of Nonuple Palace.

105
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,780
As well as the Young Host of Palace,

106
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,379
My Lord, Qingyun.

107
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,819
To have the congratulations

108
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,379
from both Envoy Xueyue

109
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,699
and the Young Host of Palace,

110
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,420
it's really a great honor

111
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,139
for my Taoyuan Valley.

112
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,459
Please sit, my host.

113
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,340
Please.

114
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,379
Beside Envoy Xueyue and me,

115
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,579
there's one more guest

116
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,059
coming here.

117
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,819
The long-lost eldest disciple

118
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,699
of Nonuple Palace.

119
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:56,939
Five years ago,

120
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,980
the former Envoy Xueyue, Chu,

121
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,220
disappeared unexpectedly.

122
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:02,540
Fortunately,

123
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:03,939
we have found her in Taoyuan Valley

124
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:05,300
a few days ago.

125
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:11,939
There she is,

126
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,780
Jin Baiwan

127
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,459
Me?

128
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,499
What?

129
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:20,540
How come Jin Baiwan is

130
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,819
the eldest disciple?

131
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:23,780
My wife is just

132
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,619
a kitchen maid

133
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:25,699
in Jin's Escort Agency.

134
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,220
You must have misunderstood.

135
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,900
Mr. Qingyun

136
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,579
I'm afraid it's really a misunderstanding.

137
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,819
How could Baiwan

138
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,619
be the Envoy Xueyue

139
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:37,939
of Nonuple Palace?

140
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,780
This is 100% true.

141
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,459
For proof,

142
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:44,939
just ask the current Envoy Xueyue.

143
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,059
There's only one Envoy Xueyue in

144
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,259
Nonuple Palace each time in our histories.

145
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,900
Each envoy got a mark

146
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,819
like a red moon.

147
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
There's a mark?

148
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:10,979
It's really...

149
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,339
It's really a mark.

150
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:21,260
Miss Jin

151
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:22,739
Please look at your waist,

152
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:23,699
and you'll know.

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,819
Just the same as mine.

154
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,099
My senior sister has been missing for years.

155
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,859
We had never expected she was saved
by Head Escort Jin.

156
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,260
All the staff in Nonuple Palace

157
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,099
greatly appreciate it.

158
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,099
Looks like it's

159
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,459
not only the big day for

160
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,500
Head Escort Jin's daughter,

161
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,500
but the big day of

162
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,059
Jin's Escort Agency and Nonuple Palace.

163
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,900
It's two blessings in one day.

164
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:14,939
Congrats, Brother Jin.

165
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,540
Congratulations.

166
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:18,739
A double blessing.

167
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:19,979
Really a double blessing.

168
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,459
Jumping to the conclusion

169
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,660
based on such a little mark,

170
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,059
isn't it a little arbitrary,

171
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,579
my host?

172
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:28,500
Right.

173
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,699
Lord Qu, you can say that again.

174
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:31,620
My host

175
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,660
It's a matter of vital importance.

176
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:33,859
Hope there would be

177
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,939
a close investigation, my host.

178
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,540
If there's any doubts,

179
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,819
the Majesty Jing Yuan would prove it

180
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:42,260
after she comes back to the palace with me.

181
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:48,739
Jin Baiwan now is

182
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,739
the first lady of my Tingqin Garden,

183
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:51,660
my love wife.

184
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,500
There's no way

185
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,459
you can take her

186
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:57,059
as you want, my host.

187
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,300
Everyone in the palace has been

188
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,620
looking for her during

189
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,859
her five missing years.

190
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,099
Under orders from the Majesty,

191
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:09,939
I must take her

192
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,099
away today.

193
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,780
In your words,

194
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,620
you are going to take away

195
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,819
my wife by force, right?

196
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:24,660
Zheng

197
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,939
I'm afraid even Tingqin Garden

198
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,059
cannot stop

199
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:30,260
the disciple of

200
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,579
Nonuple Palace coming back.

201
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,180
If you insist on

202
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,219
acting in a tyrannous manner,

203
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:35,500
I can't absolutely

204
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,979
allow you take

205
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,140
my wife away.

206
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,819
That's absurd.

207
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:56,420
On the big wedding day of Taoyuan Valley,

208
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,339
how dare Qu Zheng

209
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,260
take such actions,

210
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,459
totally thumbing his nose

211
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,260
at you, my Lord.

212
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,660
Things might not be like that.

213
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,660
Perhaps Lord Qu

214
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,059
got some misgivings.

215
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,420
Where are those people

216
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,339
of Nonuple Palace?

217
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:11,500
The Young Host

218
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,900
and the disciples of Nonuple Palace

219
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:13,979
took their leave this morning,

220
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,579
saying that they need to

221
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:16,819
report what had happened last night

222
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,420
immediately to the Host Jing Yuan.

223
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,339
For this Jin Baiwan,

224
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,500
Qu Zheng has actually offended

225
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,500
Nonuple Palace openly.

226
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,819
It's not supposed to be like this.

227
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,739
Since they've engaged,

228
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,180
isn't is of much good for

229
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:29,180
Tingqin Garden when Jin Baiwan

230
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:30,180
comes back to Nonuple Palace?

231
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:30,699
Right.

232
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,819
It just confirms that

233
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,260
he got some ulterior motives.

234
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,260
Don't talk nonsense.

235
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,699
There must be some reasons

236
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:36,780
for Lord Qu.

237
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:38,660
You're still covering for him, Doctor Su.

238
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:40,339
Perhaps it was also him who stole

239
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,540
the sacred book and the saussurea.

240
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,859
It looks to me as if

241
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,459
he had his fingers in the till.

242
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,339
That's a dirty lie.

243
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:45,819
Right, right.

244
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,300
It's right.

245
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,260
Qiu'er

246
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,739
Hi.

247
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,540
They were all the men

248
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,780
of the ganghood just now.

249
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,500
Qiu...

250
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,699
You really shouldn't

251
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:08,500
make such a rash action.

252
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,219
Because you were hiding

253
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,099
things from me,

254
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,420
I need to figure it out myself.

255
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,500
The ganghood stuff

256
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,300
is not you women's business.

257
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:15,219
A woman is doomed to

258
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,699
be a fool who knows nothing?

259
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,459
You're now the young lady

260
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,180
of Taoyuan Valley.

261
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,459
In the public,

262
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:23,099
even it's only pretending,

263
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,300
I do wish you could

264
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:25,260
behave yourself,

265
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
and don't cause any trouble.

266
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,739
So you're saying

267
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,260
we are going to be a phony couple,

268
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,500
right?

269
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,059
I...

270
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,140
I didn't mean that.

271
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,500
My young lord,

272
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:34,819
I got it.

273
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:36,099
I know where Lord Qu

274
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,260
and Miss Jin are.

275
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:05,939
Where am I?

276
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,140
Who are you?

277
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,540
Greet to Mrs. Qu.

278
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,059
What's this all about?

279
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,420
Lord Qu told us to

280
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,219
serve you to get a good rest.

281
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Lord Qu

282
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:21,780
Zheng

283
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:24,459
Where is he?

284
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,859
What's all this?

285
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,620
Pay respect to Mrs. Qu.

286
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:57,380
May blessing be with you, my lady.

287
00:16:58,099 --> 00:16:59,459
May joy be with you, my lady.

288
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,380
May health be with you, my lady.

289
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,300
Where am I?

290
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,620
Need to ask?

291
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,579
Of course it's Tingqin Garden.

292
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:16,099
Tingqin Garden

293
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:17,859
Where is Zheng now?

294
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,660
Why did he bring me here?

295
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,459
Zheng is...

296
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,140
Since he just came back,

297
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,459
he certainly has lots of things

298
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,339
to deal with.

299
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,420
He wants you to relax,

300
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,099
and make yourself

301
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,699
at home.

302
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,219
No.

303
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:31,180
He started a fight at that time.

304
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Why he doesn't come to see me?

305
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,180
Is anything happened to him?

306
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,780
Don't worry.

307
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:38,620
I'll get some foods first.

308
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:40,300
Take good care of Mrs. Qu.

309
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:41,219
Okay.

310
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,979
Mrs. qu

311
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,739
Zheng

312
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,380
How is she?

313
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:57,500
She's alive and well.

314
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:58,780
But not you.

315
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,660
You put up the fight

316
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,140
when you haven't got cured from the poisoning.

317
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,500
You were abusing your body.

318
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm okay.

319
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,059
How's the investigation

320
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,900
going on?

321
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:07,900
According to the tip,

322
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,180
the eldest disciple

323
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,140
of Nonuple Palace, Chu,

324
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,380
did disappear five years ago.

325
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:13,380
But is it just a coincidence?

326
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,380
Have we already

327
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,180
been exposed?

328
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,300
That's why they have claimed that

329
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,300
Baiwan is Chu,

330
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,660
and use it against us.

331
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,620
No.

332
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,420
They are not lying.

333
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:23,459
She is the disciple

334
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:24,699
of Nonuple Palace.

335
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,380
What?

336
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,579
She is one of the

337
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,140
masked killers?

338
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,780
Well...

339
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,660
The Massacre in the year...

340
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,540
Not her.

341
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:35,699
She was stuck in the cliff

342
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,739
like me

343
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,780
when it happened.

344
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:38,620
What's more,

345
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:40,660
it's her who saved my life.

346
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,259
Dad, mom.

347
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:43,739
I...

348
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,699
Dad.

349
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:03,299
Dad

350
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:05,259
Dad

351
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,299
Dad

352
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,660
Dad

353
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,820
Dad, what happened, Dad.

354
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:11,939
Dad

355
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Puyuan Canon

356
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,420
Who are you?

357
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,100
How dare you kill my entire family

358
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,380
for Puyuan Canon?

359
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:01,779
Yifei

360
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:05,979
Yifei

361
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:25,939
Lord Xueyue

362
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,060
What does this mean?

363
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:28,299
He is the murderer

364
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,459
who slaughtered the whole family of Xu.

365
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,620
He's no way the murderer.

366
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,459
But it's an order from the Majesty.

367
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,299
I'll make it clear by asking the Majesty.

368
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:39,739
Get out of here now.

369
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,259
Chu

370
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:32,820
Chu

371
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,860
One's only crime

372
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
was only to carry a jade.

373
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,499
Worried about such trouble,

374
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:43,380
my parents put

375
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,420
the last two pages of the sacred book

376
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,900
in the Gongche Notation

377
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,820
of the seven-string Guqin.

378
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,739
The consequences would

379
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,100
be unbearable to contemplate

380
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,939
if Jing Yuan got the book.

381
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,539
That Jing Yuan has committed

382
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,939
towering crimes.

383
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:56,620
In this case,

384
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,459
he also has something to do with

385
00:22:58,539 --> 00:22:59,499
Baiwan's memory loss.

386
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,420
She had always been

387
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:01,499
deceived and

388
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:02,900
driven by him.

389
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
Five years ago,

390
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:06,580
she must have found something

391
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:08,779
and disobeyed Jing Yuan,

392
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,939
which caused her loss of memory.

393
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,660
After that,

394
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,380
she was saved by Jin's Escort Agency.

395
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,979
So what to do now

396
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,340
to deal with Jing Yuan?

397
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:20,820
Right now,

398
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:22,739
the saussurea must be in his hands.

399
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
He's going to enjoy such

400
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
a big gift for a while.

401
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:33,259
My host

402
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,459
Is this the saussurea involucrata?

403
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,219
Yes.

404
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,259
With this,

405
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,580
you'll heal soon, my host.

406
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,380
Congratulations on your recovery, my host.

407
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:06,180
Fortunately,

408
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,620
I still got Zijing.

409
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,180
It's not in vain

410
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,499
to promote her as my Envoy Xueyue.

411
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:11,499
Right.

412
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,779
Not only the steady Envoy Xueyue,

413
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:16,060
the Young Host of Palace is also promising.

414
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:18,340
With these two capable assistants,

415
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,739
you're bound to command the

416
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:21,820
Martial Arts world, my host.

417
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,420
Does Qingyun know

418
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,299
the reason why you come to

419
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,140
Nonuple Palace every time?

420
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,539
Don't worry, my host.

421
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,820
The young host only knows that I come

422
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,140
regularly to nurse you, my host.

423
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,380
Nothing else.

424
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,499
You'll be dead

425
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,620
when he finds out the secret of

426
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,100
my retreat.

427
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,979
I dare not.

428
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,779
Your majesty

429
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,420
I have important things to report, your majesty.

430
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,380
Say it.

431
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:48,620
According to Envoy Xueyue,

432
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,979
she has found the long-lost

433
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,100
senior sister, Chu.

434
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,699
You did you say?

435
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,299
My host

436
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,299
My host

437
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:09,259
How did this happen?

438
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,939
Why doesn't he have

439
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,979
lunch with me?

440
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,900
Taking me here without a word,

441
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,060
what does he mean exactly?

442
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,100
It's only because that

443
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,420
there are lots of things to do for him.

444
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,380
You know,

445
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,060
for men,

446
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,420
career first.

447
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:42,499
What's that?

448
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:44,219
Nothing, it's nothing.

449
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,860
Enjoy yourself.

450
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,939
Zheng

451
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,420
Zheng

452
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,660
Zheng

453
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:11,620
Zheng

454
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:22,779
Zheng

455
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,739
Where are you?

456
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,580
Baiwan

457
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,299
You are in such a hurry to see me

458
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,939
after only a few days.

459
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:40,620
What is going on?

460
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:43,820
What do you want to know, Baiwan?

461
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:45,420
I know you won't

462
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,420
tell me the truth.

463
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,739
Don't ever try to keep it from me.

464
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:51,180
Let me see.

465
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,299
I knew it.

466
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:04,860
You took me back but wouldn't see me.

467
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,660
I knew you got seriously injured.

468
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,860
Where's the medicine?

469
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,299
I'll put a dressing on your wound.

470
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,660
Look at you.

471
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,739
Have you ever thought about that

472
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,580
perhaps I was just simply

473
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,219
hiding from you.

474
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:25,860
Of course I have.

475
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,340
You got hurt because of me.

476
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:31,299
You surely don't want me

477
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:32,499
to see your wounds.

478
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,060
I have to take good care of you.

479
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,620
What's more...

480
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,340
What's more?

481
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:41,660
You said that

482
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:43,620
our engagement

483
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,779
could be real.

484
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,380
Since you're my husband,

485
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:56,820
of course I'm going to look after you.

486
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,180
You've always been protecting me.

487
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,860
This time just

488
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:01,580
allow me to take care of you.

489
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:03,219
It's done.

490
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,699
Your wounds...

491
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,539
Does it hurt?

492
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,539
I should ask you that.

493
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:26,259
When I changed fresh dressing

494
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:27,380
for your wound at the inn,

495
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,499
I saw your body

496
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,180
covered with wounds.

497
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:35,979
I knew that.

498
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:38,380
Muqiu had also told me before.

499
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:39,779
She said that perhaps

500
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:40,979
some bad buy had

501
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,660
done bad things to me,

502
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,420
and caused these wounds.

503
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:46,620
I knew that

504
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:49,499
being betrayed

505
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,180
and cheated

506
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,539
by the beloved

507
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,100
are much more painful

508
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:57,739
than those wounds.

509
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,459
What are

510
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:04,299
you talking about?

511
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,180
Baiwan

512
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
What if I find

513
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,420
those who brought you

514
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,499
those wounds?

515
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,299
What would you do?

516
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,180
I've thought about

517
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,299
restoring my memory.

518
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,380
But

519
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:23,539
I've already forgot it,

520
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,299
and left that man.

521
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:27,580
And then I ran into Muqiu,

522
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,380
and the people in Jin's Escort Agency.

523
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,420
They were so nice to me.

524
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,979
Now that those things

525
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,779
have gone already,

526
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:35,420
I should just enjoy

527
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:36,979
every day from now on?

528
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,380
Enjoy every day...

529
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,900
Wait,

530
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,259
why it's about me again?

531
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:48,259
Don't try to muddle through.

532
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,580
What happened exactly

533
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,100
on that night?

534
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:51,979
Qi said I

535
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,499
belong to Nonuple Palace.

536
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:54,499
Why did you

537
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,580
take me here?

538
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:57,499
Do you believe

539
00:29:58,259 --> 00:29:59,180
that story?

540
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,380
That's odd.

541
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:07,100
From escorting the sacred book.

542
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,060
Qing Songke's death.

543
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,699
The fake book.

544
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
And we've been hunted

545
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:13,499
in Taoyuan Valley.

546
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,860
The Nonuple Palace,

547
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:17,459
one of the very best schools,

548
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,660
suddenly

549
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,499
called me as their eldest disciple.

550
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,499
It's quite suspicious.

551
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,539
You mind is

552
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:26,820
clear, Baiwan.

553
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:28,739
But when they talked

554
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:30,340
about the mark

555
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:31,580
on my wrist,

556
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,499
I was doubted.

557
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,660
That little mark

558
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:37,100
could be fake.

559
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,699
What's more, it's just a verbal

560
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:40,580
statement with no proof.

561
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,739
So you need to tell me

562
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,299
what happened

563
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,699
the other night.

564
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,060
Just as your thoughts,

565
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
the people of Nonuple Palace

566
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:49,860
tried to take you by force.

567
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,299
But I had

568
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,939
knocked out all of them.

569
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:55,420
That's why your wounds

570
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,620
got more serious, right?

571
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,219
It's true there's no one to trust.

572
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:03,900
Beside Jin's Escort Agency,

573
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,340
it's only you.

574
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,779
I remember you said that

575
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:16,180
the least trustworthy man on this world

576
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,660
would be me, the cunning fox.

577
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:24,420
Well, it was that before the wedding.

578
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,259
Moreover,

579
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,259
we've already...

580
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,499
Well, your dressing has already been changed.

581
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,820
Put on your clothes.

582
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:39,779
I feel weak.

583
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,900
Looks like

584
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,739
only you could help me.

585
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:43,499
You...

586
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,459
You can't do things by halves.

587
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,539
The one took off my clothes should also

588
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,499
put them on for me.

589
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,180
Alright, it's done.

590
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,499
Had I known that

591
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,499
I could get your

592
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:19,820
nicely treat,

593
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,739
I would get wounded earlier.

594
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:23,660
Don't talk nonsense.

595
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:26,499
It's dark.

596
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:28,100
Go to bed early.

597
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,820
I'll be up to see you tomorrow.

598
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,140
Let me walk you back.

599
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,180
No, it's okay.

600
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:34,499
I can't sleep

601
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,380
without walking you back.

602
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,459
From now on,

603
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:05,860
I will make you

604
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,219
happy in everyday of your life,

605
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,299
and never be disturbed by the previous

606
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,739
blood and ugliness.
