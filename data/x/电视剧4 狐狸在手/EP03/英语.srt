3
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,777
I have nothing but the waist pendant

4
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:43,977
to repay Mr. Qu

5
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:44,937
for your great kindness.

6
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:45,937
Though

7
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:47,697
it is worthless

8
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:48,898
I always keep it with me.

9
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,978
If you don't mind,

10
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:51,738
I'll give it to you.

11
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:57,377
These days

12
00:01:57,498 --> 00:01:58,577
you've been acting stealthily.

13
00:01:59,138 --> 00:01:59,818
What are you busy doing?

14
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:02,057
From now on,

15
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:03,257
I don't need to be stealthy.

16
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:05,377
Here you are.

17
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:08,818
For me?

18
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:11,937
You always say

19
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:13,138
I'm a cunning fox.

20
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:14,778
From now on,

21
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:15,738
whatever you want to do to me,

22
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:16,977
this little fox

23
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:17,937
will bear for me.

24
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:32,738
Miss, are you really

25
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:34,378
giving me

26
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:35,657
such a personal object?

27
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:38,977
What if it is related to

28
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:39,657
your origins?

29
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:41,697
It's precious,

30
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:43,497
so it expresses my gratitude.

31
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:48,977
Since you've kept it for so long,

32
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:51,777
I guess it was given

33
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:52,858
by someone important to you.

34
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:53,977
If it were me,

35
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:55,578
I would not like you

36
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,858
to give it to someone else.

37
00:02:58,617 --> 00:02:59,938
But you saved me several times.

38
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:00,738
If I

39
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:01,738
were the person,

40
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,137
I would only hope

41
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:05,298
you could keep it well.

42
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:17,738
Tonight,

43
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:19,897
let's rest here.

44
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:21,178
I'll go get you some water.

45
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:22,098
No, no need.

46
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,298
You just got rid of the snake venom.

47
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,137
I'll go.

48
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:24,818
I'm all good.

49
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:32,137
Then I'll make a fire and cook.

50
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:35,938
Where is my lighter?

51
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:45,617
A token of Yan School?

52
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:48,578
The Su family of Yan School has practiced medicine for generations.

53
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,418
No wonder she has such excellent medical skills.

54
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:53,178
But why

55
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,377
does she keep it a secret?

56
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,298
Mr. Qu, she makes you work again!

57
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:12,538
Mr. Qu

58
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:13,738
I mean,

59
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:14,298
she,

60
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:16,018
she got you bitten by a snake.

61
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:17,538
How can't I be mad!

62
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:21,057
Mr. Qu

63
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,178
Isn't he her cousin?

64
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:25,258
I know

65
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:26,538
our top priority

66
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,138
is to keep an eye on Jin Baiwan.

67
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:28,897
If she

68
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:29,978
runs away with sacred book,

69
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,617
anything we do will be in vain.

70
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,377
But I don't understand.

71
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,138
Why don't we

72
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:36,738
just grab it from her?

73
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,418
Why bother?

74
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,298
I

75
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:40,538
know what to do.

76
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:45,298
Miss Jin

77
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:48,377
My lighter went missing.

78
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,817
Did you see it?

79
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:52,337
There is no chance to run away now.

80
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,018
I need to wait.

81
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:06,897
Miss Su

82
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:08,337
Miss Su

83
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:10,138
Miss Su

84
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:14,258
Where is Miss Jin?

85
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:17,617
In the restroom.

86
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:26,337
That's not possible.

87
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:27,978
Her baggage is still here.

88
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,497
Mr. Qu

89
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:52,377
Jin Baiwan

90
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:53,898
is such a trouble-maker.

91
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:55,377
I've searched everywhere.

92
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,418
I couldn't even find any trace of her.

93
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,298
Is there any possibility that she was taken away by someone?

94
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:00,137
No.

95
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:01,377
She left herself.

96
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:02,898
Let's look for her separately.

97
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:04,098
I'll meet you in the next town.

98
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,418
But I'm a girl, too.

99
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:09,538
Why don't you worry about me getting lost?

100
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,858
Jin Baiwan

101
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:22,538
The tricks in my miss's book

102
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:23,617
work well.

103
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:33,257
I even took them as my friends.

104
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:34,377
So unexpected.

105
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:35,937
They also came for sacred book.

106
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:56,738
No one is here?

107
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,098
Hello?

108
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:00,738
I wanna check in!

109
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:03,577
They can't be asleep so early.

110
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:04,218
Young master

111
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,178
We've lost whereabouts of her

112
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,778
since we chased after her.

113
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,738
Now everyone

114
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:09,937
is hunting down that girl.

115
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:10,457
Madame

116
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:11,697
I want some good wine

117
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:12,497
and nice dishes!

118
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:16,057
I'll get you

119
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,377
some quilts.

120
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:18,577
Wait!

121
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:26,457
You look familiar.

122
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:29,858
Mr. Yu

123
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:31,978
What a coincidence!

124
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,218
Yeah!

125
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:34,017
Why not

126
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:35,057
have some wine with us?

127
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:40,577
Young master

128
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:43,817
Have a toast!

129
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:49,538
Both sacred book,

130
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:51,098
and the chick

131
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:52,298
have come into our trap!

132
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,457
This is returning the things to its original owner!

133
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,057
That means the Puyuan Canon

134
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:56,778
and the girl

135
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,017
both belong to you!

136
00:07:58,418 --> 00:07:59,017
No.

137
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,817
The book is mine.

138
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:01,858
That chick is

139
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:03,377
too ugly.

140
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,017
I'm too good for her!

141
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:05,898
Right!

142
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:06,497
You're the ugly one!

143
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:07,137
The ugliest one!

144
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:08,817
Come on! Raise your cups!

145
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:09,937
Bro, let's toast!

146
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:10,778
Come on!

147
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:45,858
How dare you!

148
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:49,697
I didn't buy my tittle of

149
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,898
the No.1 handsome man.

150
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,257
Stop it!

151
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:08,338
Sacred book!

152
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:11,858
I won't let you escape.

153
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:17,858
Let her go.

154
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,338
Fine.

155
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:20,858
Give me the book

156
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:21,778
and I'll let her go.

157
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:23,298
I can give it back to you.

158
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,858
He is trading the book for me!

159
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:30,137
You can't give him the book!

160
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:35,937
Just go!

161
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:37,697
Why did you give it to him!

162
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:38,298
Let's go.

163
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:39,738
Don't let her go!

164
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:43,418
How despicable you are!

165
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:44,697
You've got the sacred book but you still don't let us go.

166
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:45,658
If I let you go,

167
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:46,377
my reputation will be ruined

168
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:47,497
completely by you two.

169
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:48,377
Take them down!

170
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:50,218
Watch out!

171
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,057
Qu Zheng is as cunning

172
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:02,778
as a fox.

173
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:04,178
Why did I suffer the cutting for him?

174
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,217
So

175
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:28,538
you do know martial arts.

176
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:53,658
Seven days ago,

177
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,577
someone used pigeons to send a message to all schools.

178
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:58,737
It said the Jin's Escort Agency

179
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,097
is delivering the Puyuan Canon

180
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,097
this time.

181
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,697
Five years ago, the entire Xu family was murdered

182
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:09,097
due to the Puyuan Canon.

183
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:10,778
Five years after that

184
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,977
the book of magical martial arts

185
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:14,977
has reappeared

186
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:16,538
and caused a sensation.

187
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:17,618
There must be

188
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:20,538
something weird.

189
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:21,658
I agree.

190
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,618
Host Jing Yuan has a point.

191
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:25,378
When I received the message from the pigeon,

192
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:27,697
I just sent my daughter Zhuozhuo,

193
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:29,857
following Qu Zheng, the Tingqin Lord of the Tingqin Garden

194
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:31,658
to look into this matter together.

195
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,178
I'm sure soon we'll get the results.

196
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,697
Five years ago, the Xu family were murdered.

197
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,857
We recommended pupils of the Nonuple Palace

198
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:39,898
to make a survey.

199
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:41,618
Now that five years ago

200
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,937
we didn't find the murderer,

201
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:44,138
nowadays,

202
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:45,937
we should still

203
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:47,097
send pupils of the Nonuple Palace for surveys.

204
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,737
That should be appropriate.

205
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:49,857
Fine.

206
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:51,697
Business is business.

207
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,258
People from the Nonuple Palace

208
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,298
are known for justice and fairness.

209
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:57,057
I, representing the Taoyuan Vally, agree

210
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,097
to let Host Jing Yuan

211
00:11:58,258 --> 00:11:59,538
continue to investigate this case.

212
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:04,577
With your trust,

213
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:07,457
our Nonuple Palace

214
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,817
will fulfill our responsibility.

215
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:34,857
Rubbish!

216
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:36,658
Get up!

217
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:40,618
Envoy Xueyue

218
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,138
Help us, envoy Xueyue!

219
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:43,138
Well,

220
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,538
our young host...

221
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,057
Get away, all of you.

222
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,737
Envoy Xueyue, you just came back.

223
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,577
Now you're giving orders in my place?

224
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,217
You let go of my subordinates.

225
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,138
Do you want to practice with me?

226
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:04,217
It's been five years.

227
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,457
You always do that on this day every year.

228
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:10,217
Just because today is her deathday.

229
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:11,178
Shut up!

230
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:14,737
She's not dead.

231
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:17,138
One day,

232
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:21,577
I will find her.

233
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:23,658
You're just lying to yourself.

234
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,538
You are the young host of the Nonuple Palace.

235
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,418
And you should share the burden with your father!

236
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:29,778
It's my business.

237
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,498
None of your business.

238
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:34,138
You always know

239
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:35,778
I never meant to be your rival.

240
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:36,457
Enough!

241
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:38,298
I don't care

242
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:39,457
what you think.

243
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:47,937
Why don't you ask me

244
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:49,298
the same question?

245
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:52,097
If it were me,

246
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:54,778
I would not keep her alive

247
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,498
in the world!

248
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,538
You don't remember anything, do you?

249
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:14,937
But you still tried to protect me.

250
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:16,898
When can you

251
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:17,937
remember me?

252
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:34,018
Yifei

253
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:36,378
Yifei

254
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:07,378
Where is my sacred book?

255
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:13,977
How do you feel now?

256
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,498
Who treated my wound for me?

257
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:29,457
You almost lost your life,

258
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:30,697
so I put aside the rules and did it for you.

259
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:32,057
But I promise

260
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:33,418
I didn't take any advantage of you.

261
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:35,618
I'm still a girl.

262
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,337
I'm not married!

263
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:38,618
How could you...

264
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:40,337
If you do want me

265
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:41,217
to take full responsibility,

266
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,857
then I have to

267
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:43,577
agree.

268
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:45,178
You are reluctant,

269
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:47,498
aren't you?

270
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:49,658
Take care, your wound.

271
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:54,538
I have a question for you.

272
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,737
You deliberately keep your skills of martial arts from me.

273
00:15:57,898 --> 00:15:59,097
But you have followed me all the way.

274
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,138
You have planned everything.

275
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:02,977
All you did is for sacred book,

276
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,018
right?

277
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:05,977
I want you to tell me.

278
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,457
Who on earth are you?

279
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:10,018
I did keep something

280
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,057
from you.

281
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:12,937
But I'm a good guy.

282
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:14,577
My family name is Qu,

283
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:15,898
and first name, Zheng.

284
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:17,097
Qu Zheng

285
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,337
Madame may have mentioned that name.

286
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:24,018
Three years ago,

287
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,057
Qu Zheng, the champion of the battle of martial arts by the lake,

288
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:26,457
founded the Tingqin Garden.

289
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:29,378
So are you

290
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:30,857
the Tingqin Lord?

291
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:31,817
Right.

292
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:33,378
But why didn't you tell me?

293
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,138
Miss, do you know,

294
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,538
the sacred book you're holding

295
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:37,337
is nothing

296
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:38,498
but the Puyuan Canon

297
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:39,778
that got lost five years ago.

298
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:41,258
Puyuan Canon?

299
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:42,898
Five years ago,

300
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,618
the entire Xu family was murdered.

301
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:46,577
And the Puyuan Canon was lost.

302
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:47,618
Now, five years has passed,

303
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:49,258
the book reappeared

304
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:51,658
and caused a sensation in the world.

305
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:52,817
What I need to do

306
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,737
is to figure out

307
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:55,737
what's behind the book.

308
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:57,498
But I've never thought

309
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:58,298
it would

310
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,778
get you involved

311
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,138
and make you badly wounded.

312
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,857
So you didn't come to grab the book?

313
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:08,138
Now can you rest assured?

314
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,097
That means, along the way,

315
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,898
it was not me protecting you,

316
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:13,217
but you always

317
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:14,498
protected me secretly.

318
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:16,618
In Yu Chen's house.

319
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:17,778
In the lantern show.

320
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:18,457
Right?

321
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:19,778
You're not wrong.

322
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:22,258
But if I had told you my identity,

323
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:24,178
you would've been better.

324
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:25,457
That's right.

325
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:27,857
I got troubles

326
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:29,018
all because of you.

327
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,618
Yes, it's all my fault.

328
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:33,857
Then,

329
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:35,097
I would not disturb you.

330
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:36,498
My room is next to yours.

331
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:37,457
If you need anything,

332
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:38,577
just call me.

333
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,018
Goodbye.

334
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:41,977
I, I...

335
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:56,378
Is she all right?

336
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:58,298
The cut wasn't too deep.

337
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,378
Or

338
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:01,138
I'll never

339
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:01,817
forgive myself.

340
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,418
Are you sure it's she?

341
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:04,378
Sure.

342
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:06,697
To draw out your enemies,

343
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:08,498
you asked someone to deliver the Puyuan Canon.

344
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,018
But because of her,

345
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,057
you changed your plan again and again.

346
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,258
Are you sure

347
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:14,737
she's the one you're looking for?

348
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:21,418
Who's there?

349
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:34,097
Mr. Qu

350
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:36,018
Mr. Qu

351
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:40,457
Take care of your wound.

352
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:44,818
There's a rat in the room.

353
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:49,697
Little do I know

354
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:50,858
how you're afraid of

355
00:18:51,017 --> 00:18:52,257
a little rat?

356
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:04,457
I just want to

357
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:05,858
ask you

358
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:07,818
is it a safe inn?

359
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:09,178
Relax.

360
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:10,497
I have checked here.

361
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:11,977
And you can have your rest.

362
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:13,697
Well

363
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,497
will Yu Chen come after me again?

364
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,058
I have punished him.

365
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,058
I think,

366
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:21,098
he would not get himself into any troubles.

367
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:23,457
But, what if

368
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,178
those book-thieves

369
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,098
come to rob the book

370
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,697
when I am asleep?

371
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:32,297
I tie this red string between our hands.

372
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:34,378
I'll guard you outside your room.

373
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,257
So I can protect the book,

374
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:37,378
and

375
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:39,217
protect you well

376
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:42,497
Is it too tight?

377
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:46,338
That's it?

378
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:48,418
Have a try.

379
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:03,777
Miss Jin

380
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,178
Now do you feel secure?

381
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:09,497
It's all for protection.

382
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:10,697
Protection for the Puyuan Canon!

383
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:11,777
Have a nice dream.

384
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,178
You got me.

385
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:14,898
I'll play the zither for you outside

386
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:16,058
to help you sleep better.

387
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:01,497
Mr. Qu

388
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,017
Miss, what can I do for you?

389
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:07,257
To be honest,

390
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,297
without you,

391
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:11,818
I'm afraid I'd be dead already.

392
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:15,537
I owe you a "thank you".

393
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,898
You don't have to.

394
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:21,457
But,

395
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,497
you've lied to me so many times.

396
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:25,618
I'll keep that in mind.

397
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:28,977
Even a swordsman has two faces.

398
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:31,898
That's different from what's in the scripts.

399
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,178
Totally different.

400
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:36,697
It's always hard to tell true from false.

401
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:38,737
Not as liberal as

402
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:39,818
what people think.

403
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:41,777
So why do swordsmen like you

404
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,818
travel everywhere?

405
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:45,378
For settling down all the injustice.

406
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:46,898
For

407
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:51,578
finding my Miss Right.

408
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:55,257
You've told me

409
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:57,217
you were looking for someone.

410
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,338
Are you looking for

411
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,937
a girl?

412
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:02,058
Yes.

413
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:04,977
Then,

414
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:06,457
is she pretty?

415
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:08,658
In my mind,

416
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:10,378
she is just and honest,

417
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:12,457
kind and lovely.

418
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:14,898
She is tens of thousands of times

419
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:15,937
better than any other girl in the world.

420
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:19,658
Is she

421
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:20,818
good at martial arts?

422
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:22,697
She's better than most people.

423
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:26,338
She's good at martial arts and she looks pretty.

424
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:28,497
Then she may not be good at cooking.

425
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:32,898
I don't care about other people.

426
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:34,578
But every meal she cooked,

427
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:36,578
I enjoyed so much.

428
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,497
There can't be a perfect girl like her.

429
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:40,898
You're lying again.

430
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:42,457
Then, Miss Jin,

431
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:44,378
if one day,

432
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:45,537
I find the girl

433
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,338
that I keep looking for,

434
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,138
what do you think I should do?

435
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:51,138
How would I know

436
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:52,378
your thoughts?

437
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:16,257
But I know

438
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:17,338
what I need to do.

439
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:57,618
The Majesty,

440
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:01,297
I've heard that

441
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:02,618
all schools agreed to

442
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:03,618
let us, Nonuple Palace,

443
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:05,098
to investigate the Puyuan Canon.

444
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:06,818
So I offer to finish the job.

445
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:07,898
I have assigned it

446
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:09,138
to Envoy Xueyue.

447
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:10,418
You just need to mind your own business.

448
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:11,618
I'm sure to

449
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:12,658
finish the job properly.

450
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,138
Please take me into consideration.

451
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:16,457
I have made a decision.

452
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:18,178
You don't need to mention it anymore.

453
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:19,537
But through these years,

454
00:24:19,777 --> 00:24:20,497
you've been training

455
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:21,497
the Heisha troops.

456
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:22,338
And the troops are

457
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:23,338
commanded by Envoy Xueyue.

458
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:24,338
I also want to

459
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:25,418
do something for the Nonuple Palace.

460
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:28,178
You,

461
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:29,858
as the young host of Nonuple Palace,

462
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,257
should always remember that

463
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:32,537
Nonuple Palace

464
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:34,297
respects strength.

465
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:36,257
If you have any complaint,

466
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:38,497
show your strength

467
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:39,578
and strive for what you want.

468
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:41,098
You can't just come here,

469
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:42,937
begging me for an opportunity.

470
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:44,658
I understand.

471
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:45,937
I'll go.

472
00:24:57,257 --> 00:24:58,297
During your healing,

473
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,537
if you need anything,

474
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:00,898
just tell me.

475
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,737
I'll try my best to do that.

476
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:03,858
By the way...

477
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:04,818
What's more?

478
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,858
I get you a highly-skilled doctor.

479
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:08,138
Tell from the time,

480
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:09,098
she should be here now.

481
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,098
Mr. Qu

482
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:11,338
Mr. Qu

483
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:12,578
How was your wound?

484
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:15,697
You again?

485
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:16,418
You again?

486
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,858
You made me and Mr. Qu separated.

487
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:23,138
I couldn't sleep the whole night.

488
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:24,138
And now you're asking me

489
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:24,977
to treat your wounds?

490
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:27,658
You? Highly-skilled doctor?

491
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,737
Our Yan School has practiced medicine for generations.

492
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:32,658
Except for my dad,

493
00:25:32,818 --> 00:25:34,777
only I, Su Zhuozhuo, can be regarded as

494
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,217
a highly-skilled doctor.

495
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:40,618
Miss Su

496
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:42,338
Miss Jin got seriously wounded

497
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:43,378
because of me.

498
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,457
And I hope you can give her treatment.

499
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,257
You two lied to me,

500
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,178
saying that you were cousins.

501
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:52,618
We lied to you. So what?

502
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:53,858
You are so silly!

503
00:25:54,017 --> 00:25:55,138
You even slipped away!

504
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:56,457
Now you stew in your own juice.

505
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,217
You two were acting stealthily!

506
00:25:58,378 --> 00:25:59,977
How could you blame me!

507
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:02,058
Miss Jin, don't be mad.

508
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:03,618
Miss Su is frank and outspoken.

509
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:04,977
But she's a kind and professional doctor.

510
00:26:05,138 --> 00:26:06,457
She would not leave you wounded.

511
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:08,138
Right?

512
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,858
You want me to give her treatment.

513
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:11,338
Fine.

514
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,178
But I have one request.

515
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:15,537
What's your request?

516
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:16,858
Give me the Puyuan Canon!

517
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:17,658
What?

518
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,098
What are you talking about!

519
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:21,457
We'll talk about it later.

520
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:22,658
Mr. Qu

521
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,017
Our purpose

522
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:24,977
is to investigate

523
00:26:25,178 --> 00:26:26,058
the Puyuan Canon.

524
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:27,777
If she keeps the book,

525
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,217
she will surely lose her life.

526
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:30,338
Why don't you

527
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,138
give the book to us.

528
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:35,257
All in all,

529
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,138
you just want the book.

530
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:38,098
You are nothing different

531
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,058
from Yu Chen!

532
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:39,898
Jin Baiwan

533
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,737
You'd better follow my order while I am being nice.

534
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:43,297
If I meant to grab your book,

535
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:44,457
-I would have...  -Miss Su

536
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,138
Miss Jin is still healing.

537
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,138
If you insist on

538
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:48,338
trading the book for treatment,

539
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:50,537
I shall call another doctor.

540
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:53,737
Why are you always partial to her?

541
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:55,898
Just treatment.

542
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:57,378
I'll do it.

543
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:00,937
So many bowls of medicine?

544
00:27:02,658 --> 00:27:04,658
Why so smelly?

545
00:27:05,418 --> 00:27:06,418
I can't drink them!

546
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:08,378
The prescription of me, Su Zhuozhuo,

547
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:09,697
is invaluable!

548
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,297
Are you turning up your nose at it?

549
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:13,898
Are you playing a trick on me?

550
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,618
Anyway, I'm not feeling hurt.

551
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:18,537
Drink it or not. It's up to you.

552
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:25,737
So many medicines.

553
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:27,017
They must be bitter.

554
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,737
I can't do it.

555
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:31,977
Good medicines taste bitter.

556
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:33,457
Miss, you can rest assured.

557
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:38,418
Preserved plum?

558
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:49,858
Fine, I'll drink them.

559
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:36,017
Is it sweet?

560
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:40,858
Yes, it's sweet.

561
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:51,378
My shoulders

562
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:53,098
seem aren't that hurt.

563
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:00,858
Sweet?

564
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:03,457
I'll teach you a lesson soon!

565
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:07,898
Su Zhuozhuo

566
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:08,977
What do you want to do!

567
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:10,977
Look at your face.

568
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:12,658
You should know,

569
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:14,618
medicines for easing pain

570
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:15,937
somewhat have side effects.

571
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:17,697
Don't make a fuss.

572
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:19,257
You did it on purpose, right?

573
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,497
Yes, on purpose.

574
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,497
So what?

575
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:23,418
Your Jin family isn't strict with family disciplines,

576
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:24,537
and they didn't behave the servants.

577
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:25,737
So I teach you

578
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:26,898
how to behave well!

579
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:28,977
Do you dare to bother

580
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:30,697
Mr. Qu shamelessly

581
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:31,737
with such an ugly face!

582
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:32,697
You can curse me.

583
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,818
But how could you curse Jin's Escort Agency!

584
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:34,898
You do care about

585
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:36,098
your Jin's Escort Agency.

586
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:37,618
I just curse your whole family!

587
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,497
You are just as badly-behave as your hosts.

588
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:40,537
Miss Su

589
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:44,777
Miss Jin is injured.

590
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:46,578
I hope you could care for her.

591
00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:51,777
Why you're always on her side?

592
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:53,457
I did that for you!

593
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:55,697
Stop!

594
00:29:56,777 --> 00:29:57,378
Miss Jin

595
00:29:57,898 --> 00:29:58,658
Don't be angry.

596
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:00,977
She could curse me.

597
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:02,697
But she couldn't curse the Jin's Escort Agency!

598
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:04,178
It's my fault.

599
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:05,697
If it were not because of me,

600
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:06,537
Miss Su

601
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:07,937
would not be mad at you.

602
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:09,378
Your fault?

603
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:14,737
I get it.
