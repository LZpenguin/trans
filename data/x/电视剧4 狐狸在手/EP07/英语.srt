3
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,819
I have to make it clear.

4
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,620
Behave well.

5
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,140
Don't talk too much.

6
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,379
Don't look

7
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,580
what are forbidden to look.

8
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,140
Housekeeper, may I ask what this place is?

9
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,259
This is our warehouse.

10
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:07,460
It is always heavily guarded.

11
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,500
If you don't have anything special,

12
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,100
please stay away from here.

13
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,659
This way, please.

14
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,100
This way.

15
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,299
Where is he?

16
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,219
What are you doing? Keep up.

17
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,180
Coming.

18
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,020
Dear guests,

19
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,899
this is your room.

20
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,220
Call me

21
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,619
if you need anything.

22
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:44,660
Thank you.

23
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,619
Where we just passed by

24
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,259
must be the warehouse of Taoyuan Valley.

25
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,460
It is heavily guarded.

26
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,740
We can check that later.

27
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,499
Yes, madam.

28
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,339
They are coming for the warehouse

29
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,779
of Taoyuan Valley.

30
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,979
As temporary workers,

31
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,660
if you want to stay in Taoyuan Valley,

32
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,300
you better work hard.

33
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:16,380
Understand?

34
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,979
It seems like I have to stay here

35
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,100
for two more days before my Miss comes.

36
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,460
Something is wrong.

37
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,100
One is missing. Where is he?

38
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,339
Coming.

39
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,580
The yard is too big. I got lost.

40
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,460
Got lost?

41
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:36,899
This is not the place you think.

42
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,940
Hurry up! Do your job.

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,339
Pour this water.

44
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,820
What the hell?

45
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:45,819
You did it on purpose?

46
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:47,300
How dare you split it on me?

47
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,020
Are you blind?

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,819
How dare you stare at me?

49
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,659
Do you want me to

50
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:55,819
rip your eyes out?

51
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,379
The steward has fallen down.

52
00:03:58,499 --> 00:03:59,499
You better take him

53
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,219
for a rest.

54
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,339
Ok.

55
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,180
Steward. Be careful.

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,180
I'll deal with you when I get back.

57
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:06,740
He needs a spanking.

58
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:07,740
Deserve that.

59
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:10,580
I'm telling you

60
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,540
if you meet him later,

61
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,300
stay away from him.

62
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,219
Why don't you say anything?

63
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:18,580
Are you scared?

64
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,540
What's your name?

65
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,059
What's your name?

66
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,860
Qingyun

67
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:28,819
Qingyun

68
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:29,819
My father said he knew a famous doctor

69
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,099
who can cure my eyes.

70
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,260
Really? That's great.

71
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,619
I can see you

72
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:34,980
very soon.

73
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,580
At that time you can not only see me.

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,580
I can also take you

75
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,499
to see the best view

76
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:40,899
and do whatever you like.

77
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,499
You're not freaking out, are you?

78
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,339
Don't you even

79
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:48,339
know your name?

80
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,580
I am Qi.

81
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:51,860
I'm Jin Baiwan.

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,819
Why are you staring at me

83
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:56,099
all the time?

84
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,339
Your voice

85
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:58,659
sounds like a person

86
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:59,619
I used to know.

87
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,300
Again.

88
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,740
You guys

89
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
are all the same.

90
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,300
One said I look like

91
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,260
a person he used to know.

92
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,059
Now you tell me my voice sounds familiar.

93
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,140
However,

94
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,740
She doesn't talk as much as you.

95
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,860
Just joking.

96
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:18,939
In another word,

97
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:19,740
the man I said

98
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,819
is not you.

99
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:23,300
I do listen clearly.

100
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,540
The man in your mouth

101
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:26,740
was me.

102
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,580
How can you find

103
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,499
here so fast?

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,180
I have made it clear

105
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,860
on the letter.

106
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,300
I had no way but to

107
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,619
let you send me to Taoyuan Valley.

108
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,140
I didn't behave well.

109
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,219
Since I am here,

110
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,219
I have no reason

111
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:48,140
to trouble you.

112
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,260
We were good yesterday.

113
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,059
Why?

114
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:52,740
You are so cold

115
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,619
to me today.

116
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,900
Besides,

117
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,139
we don't say troubles between couples.

118
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,660
But the marriage

119
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,379
is fake indeed.

120
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,660
As long as everyone takes it seriously,

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
who cares it is fake?

122
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:09,499
As the Lord of Tingqin Garden,

123
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,939
because of being used,

124
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:12,660
you signed the marriage contract.

125
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,540
If everyone knows,

126
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,340
how will they think of you?

127
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,499
If I say,

128
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,420
I don't care.

129
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,699
But I do.

130
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,900
I only meet you

131
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,259
in chance.

132
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,619
I can't reward you

133
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,980
if you treat me like this.

134
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,579
We have a life time

135
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,340
to be together.

136
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:34,379
You have so many chances

137
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,900
to pay me back.

138
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,499
A life time?

139
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,699
How can you say those words

140
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,780
casually?

141
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:42,980
I get it.

142
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,379
You are right.

143
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,860
Words like a lifetime

144
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,220
can't be promised easily.

145
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:48,780
Since this marriage

146
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
was put forward by you,

147
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,939
you can cancel that.

148
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,619
But for this,

149
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,059
you have to consider it carefully.

150
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,459
Although we have signed

151
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,579
the marriage contract,

152
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,379
this is still a serious thing.

153
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,300
I won't force you.

154
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:05,980
You didn't force me.

155
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,100
It's...

156
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:08,300
I don't want to

157
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,499
trouble you anymore.

158
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:10,579
What if I'm willing

159
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,579
to be troubled?

160
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:16,340
Let go in this way.

161
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,860
When you figure this out,

162
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,420
you can come to me

163
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,379
to break the marriage.

164
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,100
Therefore,

165
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:22,819
I will not trouble you.

166
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,780
Dad

167
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,259
Are you sure this

168
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,980
can attract Mr Yu?

169
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,139
I have already told you that.

170
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,139
He

171
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,860
likes girls

172
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,340
who can do unique romance.

173
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:53,660
As long as we do what he wants,

174
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,220
this must work.

175
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,300
But

176
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:57,459
my music

177
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,819
has almost finished.

178
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,220
Play one more.

179
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,420
I can only play this one.

180
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Look, my girl,

181
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,379
why can't you get any advantage

182
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,499
from your mom?

183
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:08,619
If no one stops your mom,

184
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,939
she could play it all night long.

185
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:10,860
Her...

186
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,019
Coming.

187
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:14,819
Fingers.

188
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:23,259
Mr Jin

189
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:30,819
Well...

190
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,420
Go ahead.

191
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:32,619
Yes, sir.

192
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,019
Go.

193
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,259
I seek for Spring by riversides on a fine day,

194
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,939
What refreshing sight does the boundless view bring?

195
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,220
I find the face of vernal wind in easy way:

196
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,980
Myriads of reds and violets reveal only spring.

197
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,860
Miss Muqiu

198
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,579
Mr Yu

199
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,819
I never know Miss Mu

200
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,699
has so many talents.

201
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,100
My father told me when I was a little girl

202
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,019
that I have to be

203
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,939
a well-behaved lady.

204
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,619
So these are easy for me.

205
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,019
It's indeed a custom of a famous family.

206
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,459
My girl can't do anything but

207
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:20,499
talk nonsense

208
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:21,459
like me.

209
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:22,300
By a happy coincidence,

210
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:25,019
I have brought my Xiao.

211
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,300
Why don't we cooperate a song?

212
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,579
Sure.

213
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,780
So let's play...

214
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,579
Let's play The Autumn Days.

215
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:36,139
Okay.

216
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,339
That's right.

217
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,699
What a relief that

218
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,059
her mother forced her

219
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,540
to learn this song.

220
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,939
Bingo.

221
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,380
Cancel the engagement?

222
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,900
Baiwan told me like that.

223
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,339
Is this because

224
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,819
I told that to Su Zhuozhuo?

225
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,099
Lord

226
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,540
That was because Su Zhuozhuo drugged me.

227
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,500
It's hard for me to find a wife.

228
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:37,140
Now this has been messed up.

229
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,620
It seems that

230
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,660
I have to be alone to death.

231
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:41,579
Lord

232
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:42,939
I won't let you be alone to death.

233
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,059
You've got me.

234
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,699
No.

235
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,660
I will help you to convince her.

236
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:49,739
Sit down.

237
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:50,699
Do you forget that

238
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,339
we come to this valley

239
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
is for Saussurea involucrata case.

240
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,540
Baiwan not being around is a good thing.

241
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,180
Wait for a few days.

242
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,780
When the young lady of Jin's Escort Agency comes,

243
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,219
she will be protected.

244
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,859
So about cancelling the engagement...

245
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,859
Relax.

246
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,339
This marriage

247
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:07,459
can't be cancelled easily.

248
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,180
Linfeng

249
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,459
About Tongfu Town,

250
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
do you arrange it well?

251
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:18,500
Mr Jin, you can rest assured.

252
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:19,540
It has been done.

253
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,339
Ok. Good.

254
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:23,859
The kite is flying.

255
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:27,140
Kite.

256
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,420
Miss Muqiu, do you like kites?

257
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,819
My Qiuer

258
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:31,859
likes kites so much.

259
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,500
Dad

260
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,099
Jueming

261
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,540
Find a kite to me.

262
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:39,339
Yes.

263
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:41,819
This is

264
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,660
made by you?

265
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:44,859
Yes.

266
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:51,260
Can I write on it?

267
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:52,380
Of course.

268
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,459
Robe may wet in apricot flowers rain.

269
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,660
Out cool in my face the willows blow.

270
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,620
Go. Let's fly the kite.

271
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,699
Mr Yu, look.

272
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:22,939
The kite is flying.

273
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,180
It was all my fault.

274
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:49,979
Miss Muqiu

275
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,219
Don't mistake me.

276
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,099
I am definitely not

277
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,500
that kind of easy guy.

278
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
I did not let you kiss me

279
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,059
on purpose, too.

280
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,099
Miss Muqiu

281
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:15,859
Although we already have engagement,

282
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,900
after these days

283
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,300
with you,

284
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:19,380
I find that

285
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,699
you are

286
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,180
the one I dreamed of.

287
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,819
So I won't dare to offend you.

288
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,939
Dreamed of?

289
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,420
Is that mean

290
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,140
you like...

291
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,819
Yes.

292
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,660
I fancy you.

293
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,780
I really

294
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,219
appreciate this marriage.

295
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,219
Me, too.

296
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,420
Rest assured.

297
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,459
In my whole life, I will try my best

298
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,459
to not change this feeling.

299
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,540
You all had a long day.

300
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,059
Take down all the things,

301
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,939
and you can relax in the hotel. Hurry up.

302
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:18,739
Miss, be careful.

303
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,579
Give me your hand, my lady.

304
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,459
Come on. Take all down.

305
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,099
Ok.

306
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,380
Slow down.

307
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:24,459
Miss Muqiu

308
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,420
Mr Yu

309
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,300
Do you want to

310
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:32,459
walk with me in the night market

311
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:33,180
in the town tonight?

312
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:37,020
Sure.

313
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:44,020
I want to eat this one

314
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,620
and that one.

315
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,699
I'll have both of them, please.

316
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,420
Ok.

317
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:47,099
Let's go.

318
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,979
Give it to me.

319
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,339
Sugar figures for sale.

320
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,339
Sugar figurine.

321
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,459
Mr and Miss,

322
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,380
do you want sugar figures?

323
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:55,420
I want this one.

324
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:55,819
Ok.

325
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,859
Thank you.

326
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,020
It's beautiful.

327
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,780
Let's go.

10328
00:14:58,979 --> 00:14:59,780
[Sugar figure.]

329
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,380
Take it.

330
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:02,699
Thanks.

331
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:04,219
Appreciate your help.

332
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,459
Here, the money.

333
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:18,859
Thanks.

334
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:19,819
Did you record that?

335
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:20,260
Yes.

336
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,339
I have noted them down.

337
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,859
What are you guys writing?

338
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,859
Our Lord of Valley Junior told me that

339
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,219
all of your favorites

340
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,099
should be recorded

341
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,059
on this little notebook.

342
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,859
So later

343
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,900
we won't make mistakes.

344
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,660
And you

345
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:31,900
won't be angry anymore.

346
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:36,739
You are so considerate.

347
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,059
Here, Jueming.

348
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:39,900
Ok.

349
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,579
Miss Muqiu

350
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,260
This is the first time

351
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,739
I am being with my loved girl.

352
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:46,979
If there's anything wrong,

353
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
please do tolerate me a little.

354
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:49,540
You did so well.

355
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,859
Here's one more thing.

356
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,780
May I ask you

357
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,099
not to call me Mr Yu

358
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:57,579
in the future?

359
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:58,380
After all,

360
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,459
you and I

361
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,699
may marry soon.

362
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:05,699
Ok.

363
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:08,020
So

364
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,380
what about I call you as Brother Shu?

365
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,420
Brother Shu?

366
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,579
Yu Linfeng means a jade tree in the wind.

367
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:19,739
Miss Muqiu

368
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,859
You are really talented.

369
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,660
So, since you

370
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,020
call me Brother Shu,

371
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,620
I'll call you Qiuer?

372
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,900
Ok.

373
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,260
Move.

374
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:33,300
Be careful.

375
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,459
Oh my God.

376
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,059
The true love

377
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,140
is so sweet.

378
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,099
Qiuer, are you ok?

379
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,540
I'm fine.

380
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:15,459
By the way,

381
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:17,660
there's a bookshop in front.

382
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,939
Let's go there.

383
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,180
Let's go.

384
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:25,739
Bye. Have a good day.

385
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,819
Hi, how about the sales

386
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:32,939
of Qiu qiuer's books?

387
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,660
Her books are always the bestsellers.

388
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,219
Look.

389
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,739
These are new goods.

390
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:38,620
I can recommend some of them to you.

391
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:39,180
Ok.

392
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
This one, The Lord didn't Behave Well,

393
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:42,900
has been the most popular one these days.

394
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,660
Hey, how can you recommend

395
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,020
these tacky books to others?

396
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,819
Tacky?

397
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:49,579
Sir,

398
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:50,699
how can you talk like that?

399
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,979
These novels

400
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,660
only catch the shadows

401
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:57,660
and distort the facts.

402
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:58,780
And the words of them

403
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:00,979
are rather filthy and frivolous.

404
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,260
Am I wrong for saying that?

405
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,180
You know what?

406
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,300
Don't ever touch if you don't buy.

407
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,979
What's your attitude to my Lord?

408
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,099
He...

409
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,660
Miss Jin, I can tell you that

410
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,780
two years ago,

411
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,620
there was some bad novel.

412
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,380
It depicted

413
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
our Lord

414
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:17,500
as a

415
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,059
play boy.

416
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:20,420
We all got mad at that.

417
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,059
Two years ago?

418
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:23,620
Oh.

419
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,900
It was written by me.

420
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,579
Two years ago dad always forced me to get married.

421
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:27,420
It was so annoying.

422
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,900
So I wrote that novel.

423
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:29,939
Qiuer

424
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,620
You are a lady from a famous family.

425
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,219
Don't read this book

426
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:34,739
out of your curiosity.

427
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,459
Do you understand?

428
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:40,459
You can't label all of them.

429
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,420
These books seem to

430
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,820
have a good selling.

431
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:44,860
Maybe,

432
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,860
many people like to read them.

433
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,219
But a true reader

434
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,580
will look down these.

435
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,660
Do you really hate such novels?

436
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:56,660
He doesn't dislike them.

437
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,739
He hates them!

438
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:02,699
So

439
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,900
if one day

440
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,979
those writers are standing

441
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,299
in front of you,

442
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,019
what will you do?

443
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,420
Birds of a feather flock together.

444
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,699
If there's really someone

445
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,939
who love this vulgar thing,

446
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,340
then I

447
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:17,779
will be away from them

448
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,180
and never be in touch with them.

449
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,459
Cancel.

450
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,539
Don't cancel.

451
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:29,699
Cancel.

452
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:32,459
Don't cancel.

453
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:38,820
Don't cancel.

454
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,620
He has called me Miss Jin again,

455
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,019
why can't I cancel it?

456
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,580
What should I do?

457
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,380
I guess he did it on purpose.

458
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:54,420
How can I decide

459
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,060
this kind of thing?

460
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,580
Why do you come?

461
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:07,100
I offended Steward Wang.

462
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,779
I'm afraid he will be hard on me.

463
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,699
So I want to take a walk out.

464
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Don't worry.

465
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,100
He might forget it tomorrow.

466
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:14,860
Qi

467
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,660
Where are you?

468
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,900
Get out.

469
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,699
Hurry.

470
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:20,539
Qi

471
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:22,140
The business

472
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,620
is not done yet.

473
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,499
Get out!

474
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:28,380
Qi

475
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:33,499
Where is he hiding?

476
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,699
He really holds a grudge.

477
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:37,340
Come out.

478
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:38,380
Don't worry.

10479
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:39,779
Let me deal with that.

480
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,779
Little thing.

481
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,219
Bast**d.

482
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,140
You think I can do nothing to you?

483
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:50,739
Get out quickly.

484
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,580
When I find you,

485
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,499
watch out how I will do to you.

486
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:58,299
Go go go.

487
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:58,860
Be quick.

488
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,620
Don't let me find you.

489
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:04,660
One.

490
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:08,259
Two.

491
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,779
I have seen you.

492
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:20,660
Get out.

493
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,060
Don't hide.

494
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,100
Wait for me to catch you.

495
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,539
I just look down on people

496
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:38,860
who bully the weak.

497
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,340
Feel good?

498
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,140
Don't worry.

499
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,100
I can put you under my wing in the kitchen.

500
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:44,739
He won't dare to do anything to you.

501
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:54,499
What a freak.

502
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,219
Cancel.

503
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,180
Don't cancel.

504
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:13,100
Coming here can't avoid me

505
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,100
being a kitchen helper.

506
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,060
So why don't

507
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,259
you come with me

508
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,219
to find Zheng?

509
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,900
You don't need to do that anymore.

510
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:23,900
Why are you here?

511
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:24,779
Me?

512
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:26,019
I want to be the peacemaker.

513
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,100
You obviously like

514
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:27,979
Zheng a lot.

515
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,499
Why do you have to cancel the engagement?

516
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:30,699
Nonsense.

517
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,620
Who likes him?

518
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:35,820
For sure?

519
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:37,699
Of course.

520
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,019
Think about it twice.

521
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,459
Zheng really stands by his words.

522
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:42,180
If you really cancel it,

523
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,219
there's no

524
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,779
going back on it.

525
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,459
I will not go back on this.

526
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,219
Next time I see him,

527
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,900
I will tell him clearly.

528
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:51,779
Zheng

529
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,539
Did you see Miss Jin?

530
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,779
No. No. No.

531
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:02,019
No.

532
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
You wanted to see her?

533
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,380
It has to be her

534
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,699
who has business with me.

535
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:06,539
Fine.

536
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,939
When I meet her next time,

537
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,820
I will deal with this.

538
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,340
You said you will talk to him yourself.

539
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,459
I didn't say today.

540
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,900
Fine.

541
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,340
I wanted to make a peace between you.

542
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:20,979
It seems

543
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,979
there's nothing I can do.

544
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,660
Zheng. Wait.

545
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,699
Zheng

546
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,699
I like him?

547
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,299
May...

548
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,860
be.

549
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:43,660
Lord Xueyue

550
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:44,820
I have checked it out.

551
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,340
The whole warehouse is truly like an iron wall.

552
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:47,580
I really can't break it in.

553
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,539
The marriage ceremony in Taoyuan Valley

554
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:51,459
has gathered many Kung Fu masters.

555
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,820
Do not act rashly.

556
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:53,380
Yes.

557
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,499
It seems

558
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,019
we can only wait for the night

559
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,739
before the ceremony when their people open it.

560
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,620
Go.

561
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:05,860
There are two or three days left

562
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,060
before we get to Taoyuan Valley.

563
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,060
It's fine.

564
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:09,140
It is at the end of the month.

565
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,660
We won't waste good days.

566
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,340
End of the month.

567
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,459
Yes, end of the month.

568
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,219
End of the month.

569
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:16,499
Oh, shoot...

570
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,019
What's wrong?

571
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,979
The end of the month is the deadline of my writing.

572
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,380
How can I forget that?

573
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,660
And dad,

574
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,820
don't tell Yu Linfeng

575
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:22,739
and people in Taoyuan Valley

576
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:23,939
that I write novels. Do you get it?

577
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:24,459
Get it.

578
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,779
Qiuer

579
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,699
I haven't been writing

580
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,860
for this long time.

581
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:35,539
No. No.

582
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:36,539
The contract has said

583
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:37,699
that I can't delay my writings.

584
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,979
Qiuer

585
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,499
Brother Shu

586
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:41,739
Qiuer

587
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,019
Do you want to

588
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:43,539
fly the kite with me?

589
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:44,299
I have no time.

590
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,699
I noticed that these days when you have time,

591
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,620
you will write things.

592
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,340
What are you writing about?

593
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,100
I am writing some documentary

594
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:02,660
articles about the Escort Agency.

595
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:04,739
Qiuer

596
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,180
You are really a talented girl.

597
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,539
Can I have the pleasure to read it?

598
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:09,219
No.

599
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,060
I have a habit in my writings

600
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,779
that I can't let anyone to see

601
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:13,699
beside me.

602
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,140
Otherwise, I can't write it.

603
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:17,620
I see.

604
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,860
I can assure you

605
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,180
I will not look at it.

606
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,019
You have so many talents

607
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,660
and you work so hard.

608
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,539
I really fancy you a lot.

609
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:28,620
I will not take a peek on it.

610
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,660
I just stay here to company you.

611
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,539
Then you can go there to company me.

612
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,219
There?

613
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,140
I can't be distracted. Continue.

614
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:49,580
Kung Fu Master takes down the devil

615
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,380
on the bed and laughs.

616
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,259
Laughs.

617
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,979
You are so concentrated.

618
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,259
I think this article

619
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,259
must be very beautiful

620
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:58,219
and every phrase is a gem.

621
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,100
I thought you said you weren't peeking.

622
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,299
I didn't.

623
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,860
I was focusing on

624
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,820
looking at you.

625
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,499
If I let you mistake this,

626
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:06,699
it's all my fault.

627
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,580
Here,

628
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:09,539
I apologize to you again.

629
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:11,299
Go ahead.

630
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:24,900
Kung Fu Master laughs that

631
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,420
if you don't be my girl,

632
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,180
I will...

633
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,499
God.

634
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,820
How can I write

635
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,340
with this staring?

636
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,539
If you have time in the evening,

637
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:42,499
I want to have dinner with you.

638
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,779
I have something to say to you.

639
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:45,380
Ok.

640
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,380
A man who has engagement

641
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,539
still gets close

642
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,299
with other woman.

643
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,340
A man who has engagement

644
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,900
still gets so close with other woman.

645
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,100
Why are you hanging around

646
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,219
in the valley all day?

647
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,580
Told me to figure out?

648
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:09,180
Do you figure it out?

649
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:10,539
I don't believe.

650
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:11,620
If I hide in the kitchen,

651
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,860
how can you find me?

652
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,539
Who is Jin Baiwan?

653
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:18,539
Me.

654
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,420
Lord Qu from Tingqin Garden

655
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,420
asks you to be there.

656
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:25,779
Go.

657
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,979
Lord Qu

658
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,580
This is the pastry cook.

659
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:34,620
Thank you.

660
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:38,620
Miss Jin

661
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,820
I know what you want to say.

662
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:47,860
Just speak out.

663
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:49,620
So I will say it directly.

664
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:52,900
The pastry

665
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:54,380
is chewy.

666
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,660
And this one, too.

667
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,459
In the morning,

668
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,620
Song Jianshan almost broke one tooth.

669
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:02,019
You find me here

670
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,420
just to tell me this?

671
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:05,420
Or what?

672
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,739
Don't you think I

673
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,499
will talk with you about that thing?

674
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,299
That thing...

675
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,340
If you want to say, go ahead.

676
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,100
Miss Jin

677
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,219
It seems that you have lost some weight.

678
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,860
Is that what you want to tell me?

679
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,380
It's only one day.

680
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,100
How can you be skinny like this?

681
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,340
It seems that the job in the kitchen

682
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:39,539
is too hard.

683
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,140
Why are you so close to me?

684
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,299
If there's nothing else,

685
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
I'll leave.

686
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:49,100
Who says that?

687
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,459
Why are you always hiding from me?

688
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:05,699
Don't play a trick on me.

689
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,779
Is that because of

690
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,019
our engagement?

691
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,979
If this thing can't be settled

692
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:10,979
as soon as possible,

693
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,380
are you going to keep

694
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,620
hiding from me?

695
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,219
I'm not hiding from you.

696
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:18,580
It was you who said that

697
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,979
this depends on me.

698
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,060
So you have to wait for me

699
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:23,340
to tell you the result.

700
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,420
Don't play tricks on me.

701
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,660
When my Miss comes,

702
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,420
I'll wait and see how you will do to me.

703
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:30,219
Don't know

704
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,420
when she will arrive.

705
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,499
This Taoyuan Town

706
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:04,140
is really bustling.

707
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:06,900
Good.

708
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,340
I heard that fifty percent of the

709
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,860
properties in this town all

710
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,380
belong to the Taoyuan Valley.

711
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,459
When you be there,

712
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,699
you will be the first lady in charge.

713
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,539
You are in charge of all the things.

714
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:17,620
But I don't want to be

715
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,739
the first lady.

716
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,019
No.

717
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:21,860
Well...

718
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:22,900
What do you want to do?

719
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,580
I just want to write my novels.

720
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:25,979
Oh, sweetie,

721
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,939
it's ok to write novels.

722
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,660
But

723
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,620
you have to keep this from Linfeng.

724
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,820
Hiding this is good.

725
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,779
At that year,

726
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,539
when I read your novels,

727
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:40,060
I just passed out.

728
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:41,060
No.

729
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,979
I was shocked by your talent.

730
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:48,420
My girl

731
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Now you're going to get married,

732
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,299
how about stopping writing that?

733
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:53,860
How is this possible?

734
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,580
This is my only hobby.

735
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:57,499
Dad

736
00:30:58,499 --> 00:30:59,860
No. No. No. Don't pout.

737
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:00,539
I can't bear this.

738
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:01,580
You can keep writing.

739
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:02,620
Write!

740
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:06,140
You are the best.

741
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:06,900
Okay...

742
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,340
But

743
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,219
Linfeng can't know about this.

744
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:12,900
If he knows,

745
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:14,660
he will not tolerate you

746
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,699
writing anything like I do.

747
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:21,100
Don't worry, dad.

748
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:23,219
I will not let him know.

749
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,539
What's wrong?

750
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:30,459
Head Escort

751
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:32,180
The lady's dowry chest was turned over.

752
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,580
Oh, the dowry chest was turned over.

753
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,019
Turned over?

754
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,060
What happened?

755
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:44,820
Hurry up.

756
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:46,180
Help the lady pick them up.

757
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,140
Be quick.

758
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,060
Surround this.

759
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,180
Don't let others see.

760
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
Everyone helps with the picking.

761
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,380
Uncle

762
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,539
I know Qiuer loves reading.

763
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,180
I don't know she takes so many books

764
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,620
in her dowry.

765
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,459
Readers, you know.

766
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:10,459
They are supposed to be like this.

767
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,019
Yes. Supposed to be.

768
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,019
Linfeng. You are here too.

769
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,499
We can pick up

770
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:16,499
these books.

771
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:17,219
Don't care.

772
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,939
Don't care.

773
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,620
Uncle. Qiuer

774
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,539
Why are you sweating?

775
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,499
Sweating?

776
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,219
Yes.

777
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:24,299
Really?

778
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:25,620
No.

779
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,539
Where is the sweat?

780
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
How can we sweat?

781
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,499
Yes.

782
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,539
Qiuer

783
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:37,100
Are you too nervous

784
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,259
to see

785
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,420
my parents soon?

786
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,219
Your parents?

787
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:44,979
Yes, right?

788
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,219
Yes.

789
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:48,900
I'm a little nervous.

790
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:50,340
My girl

791
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,620
doesn't experience this before.

792
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,620
Don't worry.

793
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,380
My parents are nice to others.

794
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,380
And my mother is just like you

795
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,499
who knows unique romance,

796
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,420
You

797
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:01,380
can share with each other every day.

798
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,060
You will get along with each other well.

799
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:07,979
Yes, exactly.

800
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:09,299
Will get along.

801
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,180
Of course.

802
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:19,420
What?

803
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,580
Steward Wang beat Qi?

804
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,539
Yeah.

805
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:23,580
Steward Wang

806
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,900
hurt his waist last night.

807
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,060
He stayed in bed all night.

808
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,299
Don't know why.

809
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:29,779
He said this was done by Qi.

810
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:30,459
So

811
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:31,459
he got a bunch of servants

812
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:32,580
and surround Qi

813
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,459
to beat him.

814
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,340
This...

815
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:37,420
Qi is coming.

816
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,340
Hurry up. Move.

817
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:38,620
Do your job.

818
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:39,420
Do your job.

819
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:42,900
Qi

820
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,180
Your hand is bleeding.

821
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,459
I'm not bleeding.

822
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,420
Don't be that strong.

823
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,699
It's my fault

824
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:50,660
to let your hand hurt like this.

825
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,219
None of your business.

826
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,699
How can that be?

827
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:55,580
Those things

828
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:56,620
were done by me.

829
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,259
But steward Wang only punished you.

830
00:33:58,499 --> 00:33:59,219
But this doesn't matter.

831
00:33:59,459 --> 00:33:59,860
Wait here.

832
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,979
I'll find you some medicine.

833
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,140
Wait.

834
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,739
Since you asked me out,

835
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,140
what are you going to say?

836
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,620
Mr Qu

837
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,340
I have known that the marriage

838
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,660
between Jin Baiwan and you

839
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,979
is a fake one.

840
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:17,939
So what?

841
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,060
I have been into you for so long.

842
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,100
Investigating about the Puyuan Canon

843
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:23,299
is also me asking my father

844
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,820
to do.

845
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,340
Will you consider me?
