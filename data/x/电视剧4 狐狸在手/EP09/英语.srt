3
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,580
What?

4
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:42,739
You were pretending!

5
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:44,180
Keep your voice down!

6
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,779
What are you afraid of? There's no one.

7
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,699
Brother Shu prefers fair

8
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,099
and grace ladies.

9
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,660
If I didn't pretend,

10
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,899
how could he like me?

11
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,820
So,

12
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,300
the dozens of music scores and chess manuals,

13
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,140
the Woman Commandments,

14
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,579
and all those poems,

15
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:01,579
you've recited them all?

16
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:06,899
Oh, my god.

17
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:10,140
But you may pretend that

18
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,460
you are good at Unique romance.

19
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,020
What if he knows

20
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,100
you're the author of the novel

21
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,060
that he hates most.

22
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,460
How could you do?

23
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:19,859
None of that matters now.

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,740
The important thing is that

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,500
the tune that Mrs. Yu ask me to play

26
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:25,420
on the womenfolk gathering,

27
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,859
I don't know how to play at all!

28
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,219
What can I do, Baiwan?

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,420
What can I do, what can I do...

30
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:31,899
Stop.

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,979
I'm sure I can find a way.

32
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,299
I got a way, too.

33
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,380
Lord Qu

34
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,139
is so good at playing zither.

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,339
Or...

36
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,059
Let's ask him for help.

37
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,339
If you wanna go, go on your own.

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,619
I'm not going.

39
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,619
Why do I have to come?

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,940
It's enough that he practices with you.

41
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,180
This is my big obstacle,

42
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,339
aren't you gonna help me with that?

43
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:57,380
Besides, I always think that

44
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,419
there's a misunderstanding between you two.

45
00:02:58,539 --> 00:02:59,259
Take advantage of this opportunity

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,139
to explain clearly.

47
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,339
No. But I...

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,339
Come on!

49
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,820
Go.

50
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Lord Qu

51
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,419
I am honored

52
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,860
to hear from Miss Jin

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,499
to learn the zither from me.

54
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,259
Lord Qu is indeed good at playing.

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,499
It is an eye-opening for me to know

56
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,339
what is

57
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,740
the splendid melody and the true sentiments.

58
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,699
Love hurts make love sincere.

59
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:26,539
The sound is moving,

60
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,059
may because the player feels hurt.

61
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:32,580
It's about you.

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,460
It's not.

63
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:34,499
Lord Qu

64
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,100
Now that madam is here,

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,300
you can just start teaching.

66
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,740
Since Miss Jin asked,

67
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,779
I'll do.

68
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:43,339
Miss Jin

69
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,339
Miss Jin

70
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:53,619
Are you familiar with the music score?

71
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,499
I memorized it,

72
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:58,659
but I always feel like something is wrong.

73
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,020
Strings move with your emotion.

74
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,460
The wrong feeling

75
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,980
may because you

76
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,499
haven't known the sense

77
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,420
of heart-broken.

78
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,219
The sense of heart-broken?

79
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:11,819
How to feel that?

80
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:13,899
Well...

81
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,260
Miss Baiwan

82
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,700
Could you smile to me?

83
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,300
Why would I?

84
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,420
Just as what I expected.

85
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,300
This is the sense of heart-broken.

86
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:50,779
You broke his heart!

87
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,499
What the hell...

88
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,219
Why do you teach
something about heart-broken?

89
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,499
Can you teach her

90
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,180
something good?

91
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
What is good?

92
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,260
How can I know?

93
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,980
All I know is a tune called

94
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,740
My Mind Not Brought.

95
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,059
My Mind Not Brought?

96
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:09,860
I'll never think of you,

97
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,300
You'd never think of me.

98
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,260
You put your heart on me in the past,

99
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,460
but now you can put it on others.

100
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,779
I see.

101
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,420
You're telling me to abandon,

102
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:18,540
don't pester.

103
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,099
I didn't say that!

104
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,460
You mentioned this tune,

105
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,659
don't you want me

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,740
to shrink back from difficulties?

107
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,740
I said I wouldn't come,

108
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:27,659
but you let me do.

109
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,420
I'll go!

110
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,899
-Baiwan  -Miss

111
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,020
Lord Qu

112
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,939
Don't be sad.

113
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,339
In my opinion,

114
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:38,819
Baiwan still likes you.

115
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,939
Miss Jin

116
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:40,819
do you think so?

117
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,939
It's just she

118
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,020
didn't realize that yet.

119
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,580
Then I should

120
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,619
make her realize it soon.

121
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,779
Excuse me, please.

122
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,259
Where's Miss Jin?

123
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,819
She's waiting in the wing.

124
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:57,900
Invite her to come here.

125
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,340
It's impolite

126
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:00,139
to have so many people waiting for her.

127
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,100
Yes, Madam.

128
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,740
Jin Baiwan

129
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,019
I'll teach you a lesson today.

130
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,420
Heroine Zijing

131
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,340
Mrs. Yu

132
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:18,379
Excuse me for not going out to meet you.

133
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,780
This way, please.

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,980
Why is she here?

135
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,619
Miss Jin

136
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,139
Madam said it's time for dinner.

137
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:37,860
Okay,

138
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,699
got it.

139
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,340
What do I do, Baiwan?

140
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,180
It's okay.

141
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,139
You can do it!

142
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,939
Can I?

143
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,579
Yes!

144
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:50,259
Definitely!

145
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,980
Okay!

146
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,100
I can!

147
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,860
Go for it!

148
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,379
I can't...

149
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,939
I definitely can't do it if Mrs. Yu is there.

150
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,340
Madam, it's just a womenfolk gathering.

151
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:03,180
Take it easy.

152
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,499
Relax, relax.

153
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,139
Yeah.

154
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,420
Relax.

155
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:08,780
As usual.

156
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:11,340
What are you doing?

157
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm drinking to make myself courageous.

158
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,259
This is not good.

159
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,540
It's okay.

160
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,939
All right.

161
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,180
Why hasn't Miss Jin come yet?

162
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,180
Go and ask again.

163
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,220
Yes, Madam.

164
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,939
Madam, here they come.

165
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,019
Are you okay?

166
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,939
Mrs. Yu

167
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,540
I'm here.

168
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:43,499
Let's get started.

169
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:45,780
Come on!

170
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,259
The womenfolk gathering is
a tradition of Taoyuan Valley.

171
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,780
Muqiu is going to marry into Taoyuan Valley.

172
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,379
And I hope,

173
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,300
hope that...

174
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,939
Interconnected.

175
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
I hope to take this opportunity

176
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,540
to know ladies of all families,

177
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,220
and heroines.

178
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,459
We can be closer in the future,

179
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:16,420
and inter...

180
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,780
inter...

181
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:19,660
What's next?

182
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:23,980
Interconnect!

183
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,100
For me, being docile comes to the first.

184
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,459
Put others before ourselves.

185
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:27,819
Serve the husband and bring up the children.

186
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,860
Then we can have a harmonious relationship

187
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,139
and make a satisfactory family.

188
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,139
Let us encourage each other.

189
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:36,300
It's our great honor to

190
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,420
serve you.

191
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,420
Please help yourselves.

192
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:40,699
Madam

193
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,420
Madam

194
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,220
Before that, I will play a tune first.

195
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,740
Come on!

196
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,220
Get the liquor!

197
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:49,900
The liquor!

198
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,740
Before madam plays,

199
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,540
let's toast to her.

200
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,180
Good idea!

201
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,980
Welcome to

202
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,860
Taoyuan Valley today.

203
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:04,259
Cheers!

204
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,900
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

205
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,019
Here comes the Tingqin Lord.

206
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,499
Sorry for keep you waiting.

207
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,300
-Lord Qu  -Lord Qu

208
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,819
Lord Qu

209
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,740
I've gathered you here today.

210
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:32,699
First is

211
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,699
celebrating the marriage for my son.

212
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:35,939
The second is

213
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,180
to discuss the matter

214
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,660
of Puyuan Canon.

215
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,540
Lord Qu

216
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,220
please tell us the detail of it.

217
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,619
A month ago,

218
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,699
the matter that Jin's Escort Agency

219
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,059
transported Puyuan Canon,

220
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,900
you must have heard of it.

221
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:50,100
Right.

222
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,259
When we received the mission,

223
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,860
we didn't know it was

224
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:54,780
Puyuan Canon.

225
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,939
Otherwise, I wouldn't accept it!

226
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:58,699
Mr Yu

227
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,699
Someone must have

228
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,379
set Jin's Escort Agency up on purpose.

229
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,059
The sacred book reappeared,

230
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,540
and disputes can hardly be avoided.

231
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,860
So the master of Yan School and I

232
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:06,900
talked about it.

233
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,380
Su Zhuozhuo, Miss Su of Yan School

234
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,780
will investigate the case with me.

235
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,420
That's right.

236
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,459
Mr Su told me about it, too.

237
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,099
It's true.

238
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:16,459
But,

239
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,459
what if

240
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,739
you were coveting the sacred book,

241
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,739
and you make use of the investigation,

242
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,099
steal it and replace it with something else?

243
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,780
Nonsense.

244
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,339
You covet the sacred book so much,

245
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,059
so don't you really know

246
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:28,260
what kind of book it is?

247
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,300
Good, good!

248
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,579
Well done, madam!

249
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,780
Madam

250
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:06,099
It's time to make poems!

251
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,859
Make poems?

252
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,420
Making poems is one of the traditions

253
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,020
of the womenfolk gathering
in Taoyuan Valley.

254
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:19,699
Muqiu

255
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,540
Let's start with you.

256
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,459
Okay.

257
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,180
I think

258
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,099
no one wants to make poems,

259
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,540
nor comes to the gathering either.

260
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:45,540
Gosh, gosh, gosh.

261
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:46,780
She's drunk. What do I do?

262
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:47,540
What do I do?

263
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:50,900
Let's get drunk together.

264
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,979
Let's toast to

265
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,459
the host of this gathering,

266
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,459
Mrs. Yu.

267
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,540
Here it is.

268
00:11:59,219 --> 00:11:59,699
Well,

269
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,579
please help me fill the glasses.

270
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:01,059
-Thanks.  -Wait!

271
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,739
-I'm not done yet!

272
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,180
Obviously,

273
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,459
no one wants to be here.

274
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,059
But we have to do things that are prescribed

275
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,219
because of the traditional customs.

276
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,900
It's unreasonable!

277
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:17,260
As a woman,

278
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,219
being docile comes to the first.

279
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,979
How could you be so rude!

280
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,099
Why should women

281
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,380
be docile?

282
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:24,540
Why should women follow

283
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,579
so many rules and regulations

284
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,180
after getting married?

285
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,260
Even can't do

286
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,099
the things they love.

287
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,180
You!

288
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,020
Do you wanna be a heroine?

289
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,699
If you want, just do it!

290
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,739
Do you want to be a tailor?

291
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,099
Just do it!

292
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,380
If one wanna write novels,

293
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,180
she should do it too.

294
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,219
Jin Muqiu

295
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,819
Mrs. Yu

296
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:59,059
I'm scared to see you.

297
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,140
Why are you always mad?

298
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,099
Come on.

299
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,780
Have a drink!

300
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:08,979
Madam

301
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:10,819
How dare you!

302
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,780
Here's another toast to Mrs. Yu.

303
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:14,660
One more.

304
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,219
One more.

305
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,020
Fill it.

306
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,140
Here it is, Mrs. Yu.

307
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:18,780
Come on!

308
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:23,059
How dare you!

309
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,099
Don't be so serious.

310
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,140
To everyone!

311
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,780
You need to smile more, you know?

312
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,939
Smile.

313
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,459
As we all know,

314
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,339
Puyuan Canon is a book on martial-arts

315
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,059
of the Xu's for generations.

316
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,059
What do you mean, Lord Qu?

317
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:45,540
Five years ago,

318
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:47,579
The Xu family were murdered,

319
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,780
and the sacred book disappeared.

320
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:51,579
But if the sacred book

321
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:52,739
is really that good,

322
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,540
why didn't the Xu's practice it?

323
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,260
-Well...  -Well...

324
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:57,380
It makes sense.

325
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,579
I've heard something about it.

326
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,540
Although the Puyuan Canon

327
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,500
is very powerful,

328
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,459
one who practices this martial arts

329
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,020
is easy to be possessed by the Devil.

330
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,099
So the Xu family

331
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,900
was only guarding the book.

332
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,780
That's right.

333
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,459
The ancestors of the Xu's

334
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,660
who practiced the martial arts

335
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:15,500
all died because of
being possessed by the Devil.

336
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,819
Since it is so,

337
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:20,699
why do I cut my own throat

338
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,699
to steal such a book?

339
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,859
This book is so dreadful,

340
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:26,300
then why do we find it?

341
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:27,739
Idiot!

342
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:28,500
Besides,

343
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,020
if I really

344
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,099
wanted that book,

345
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,420
I would definitely steal it secretly.

346
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:33,739
Why would I investigate it

347
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,660
with the escort,

348
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,739
and made myself a target for all?

349
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,500
Good point.

350
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,140
Leave the book is true or not alone.

351
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,219
However,

352
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:46,180
the man who let Jin's Escort Agency

353
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:47,540
sent off the Canon

354
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:49,140
must knew the facts.

355
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,579
Lord Qu

356
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,819
Can we find this man?

357
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,219
He disappeared.

358
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,939
Disappeared?

359
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:57,579
Disappeared?

360
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,859
The sender is

361
00:14:58,979 --> 00:14:59,780
Xing Laoliu.

362
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,500
When I went to his home,

363
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:02,859
there's no one.

364
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,339
Why!

365
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,219
You're right!

366
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:09,219
Why men can

367
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,219
decide anything?

368
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,699
After we marry them,

369
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,739
we can't be ourselves.

370
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,620
Poor the two heroines!

371
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,459
Why should we obey the rules?

372
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,420
Why!

373
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,579
Why women should

374
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,339
follow her husband?

375
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,059
Exactly!

376
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,500
I've tried to obey him.

377
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:29,300
It's

378
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,099
too tired!

379
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,660
I'm telling you,

380
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:40,900
In the past days,

381
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,420
I was the famous Flying Leopard!

382
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:45,620
Come on.

383
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,859
Yes!

384
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,579
How did she get that mark?

385
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,339
The madam and the guests

386
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:08,979
are so drunk,

387
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,819
shall we ask Lord of Valley to come here?

388
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:11,939
Hurry up!

389
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,300
I see.

390
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:15,620
This man

391
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:16,939
must be

392
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:17,900
the manipulator.

393
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,459
His purpose was simple,

394
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,180
that is, to mess up the whole world.

395
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:22,699
As long as we catch him,

396
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,500
we can...

397
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,300
Something's wrong, Lord of Valley!

398
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,219
Lord of Valley

399
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,500
Something happened in the womenfolk gathering.

400
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:30,339
Be a woman of indomitable spirit!

401
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,099
We can't be bullied by these men.

402
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:32,699
Be a woman of indomitable spirit!

403
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,420
We can't!

404
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:34,500
Come on, Baiwan.

405
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:35,459
How, how, how,

406
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,300
how much did they drink!

407
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,780
Yeah.

408
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,939
A nasty cunning fox!

409
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:40,339
Qiuer

410
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,059
Darling

411
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:41,939
Qiuer

412
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:42,420
I was Fooled.

413
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:42,859
Qiuer

414
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,660
You...

415
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,099
Dad

416
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,099
The smell!

417
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,939
Ladies and gentlemen,

418
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,020
we didn't take good care of everyone.

419
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,219
Please take your wives to

420
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,900
the side hall to have a rest.

421
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,380
Hangover soup will be there in a minute.

422
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,059
Excuse me, excuse me.

423
00:16:58,979 --> 00:16:59,939
It's okay.

424
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:01,660
It's really him.

425
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,859
So he came to Taoyuan Valley too.

426
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,900
Come on, come on.

427
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,020
What?

428
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,939
You're all gone,

429
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,979
nobody takes care of me.

430
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,859
Okay, Okay.

431
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,020
Don't go, please.

432
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:16,939
Darling, be careful.

433
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:17,780
Come on.

434
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:22,979
Fox?

435
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,540
Why are you here too?

436
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:25,540
I'm here to pick you up.

437
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:29,660
Come on.

438
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,699
Water still flows,
though we cut it with our swords.

439
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,859
We may drown the countless sorrow with wine.

440
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,020
-The countless sorrow.  -Miss Jin

441
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,020
Please stop!

442
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,099
Jueming, close the door.

443
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,900
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,739
The countless sorrow.

445
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,339
Qiuer

446
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,819
Come on.

447
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:52,819
Give this to me.

448
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,459
Brother Shu

449
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,059
-Be careful.  -Stay there!

450
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:07,219
Unique romance is

451
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:10,459
a piece of cake for me.

452
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,020
Lord, the windows and door are closed.

453
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:19,939
Stay there!

454
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:29,979
Lord

455
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:30,900
Stop.

456
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:31,660
Stop that now.

457
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,699
Go to find uncle Jin.

458
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,699
He went to find Miss Su

459
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:35,500
to get the hangover prescription

460
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,300
when he saw Miss Jin was drunk.

461
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,739
Then urge him.

462
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,739
Okay, okay, okay.

463
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,739
Why do you go?

464
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:42,499
Qiuer

465
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,100
It's not appropriate
for a single man and a woman

466
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,939
to stay in the same room.

467
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:54,699
Well,

468
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,019
I'll let a maid look after you.

469
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,140
Stop!

470
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:58,660
Come back!

471
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:03,420
What?

472
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,019
Let me ask you,

473
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,219
whether you love me

474
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,459
or not?

475
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,979
Of course, I do.

476
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:15,100
There's

477
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:15,939
no doubt.

478
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,100
I swear to God.

479
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:17,900
No!

480
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,660
Who you love is not me!

481
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,459
Qiuer

482
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:22,699
You're drunk.

483
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,499
Well,

484
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:24,699
let's talk

485
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,340
when you're awake tomorrow.

486
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:26,340
Let me help you to rest.

487
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,299
I'm not drunk!

488
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,620
I don't wanna lie to you anymore.

489
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:34,939
What?

490
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,539
I lied.

491
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,739
I don't like

492
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,060
unique romance,

493
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:45,140
flower arrangement and the tea culture at all.

494
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,219
I'm not a grace lady either.

495
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,499
To make you like me,

496
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,140
I read books,

497
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,259
play the zither and paint every night.

498
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,979
I'm so tired.

499
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,539
I don't wanna be a grace lady.

500
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,180
I don't wanna be others.

501
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,299
Qiuer

502
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:07,580
Don't talk nonsense.

503
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,580
Don't break the rules

504
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:09,420
of Taoyuan Valley.

505
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,739
Rules, rules!

506
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:12,699
Why are there

507
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:13,699
so many rules in Taoyuan Valley!

508
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,820
I hate rules!

509
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,939
Why do you like

510
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,259
everything

511
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,499
I hate?

512
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,979
If I tell you,

513
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm not

514
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,219
a grace lady at all.

515
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,420
Will you love me?

516
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,779
I don't care

517
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:44,299
if you are or not.

518
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,499
But

519
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,459
this thing

520
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,539
angered father and mother.

521
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,779
I need to end it up for you.

522
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,060
Put me down!

523
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:00,860
I'm gonna get even with them!

524
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:01,459
Baiwan

525
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,180
You're drunk.

526
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:04,380
I'm not.

527
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,900
I'm Jin Baiwan,

528
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
the heroine of Jin's Escort Agency!

529
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:10,140
So,

530
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:12,180
before you went to Jin's Escort Agency,

531
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,259
what did you do?

532
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,860
How do I remember what I did?

533
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:16,620
I don't know!

534
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,019
Put me down,

535
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,539
I'm going back.

536
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,299
Be good.

537
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:28,380
Impossible.

538
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:29,939
Dad said

539
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,779
she is dead.

540
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,060
Yes!

541
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,140
But why would Zijing want to kill her?

542
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,539
And the mark,

543
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,019
it won't be wrong.

544
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,939
Put me down, put me down.

545
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,420
I'm gonna get even with him!

546
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,900
Who?

547
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:51,820
Qu Zheng

548
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Why?

549
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,699
Qu Zheng

550
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,580
You're a liar!

551
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,140
You tell me you don't know kung fu, huh?

552
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,699
And you tricked me into being your bodyguard?

553
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,100
And you tricked me into an engagement?

554
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,660
You're a big liar!

555
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,580
But the engagement

556
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:17,939
was proposed

557
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,019
by you.

558
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,539
Me?

559
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,939
How could that be possible?

560
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,100
He even wanted to break off the engagement.

561
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:27,100
This was

562
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,739
proposed by you too.

563
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,060
Me, again?

564
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,779
Forget it.

565
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:39,900
Well,

566
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,380
he told madam

567
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:43,180
that

568
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,019
he likes me.

569
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,620
This I can

570
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:52,420
assure you,

571
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,140
it's not a lie.

572
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,499
How can you assure that?

573
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,019
I'm telling you,

574
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:02,820
Qu zheng

575
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,219
He is a liar,

576
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,580
a cunning fox!

577
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,060
Don't believe

578
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,860
what he told you.

579
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,459
I hate him!

580
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:11,979
If

581
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,580
you really hate him,

582
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,180
why were you so angry

583
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,259
when Su Zhuozhuo

584
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:17,620
said she loved him?

585
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:19,820
And why

586
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:21,019
did you go into

587
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,100
the trap

588
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,259
he set up?

589
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,219
If you really hate him,

590
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,739
why were you thinking of him

591
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:28,420
when you were drunk?

592
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,100
Yeah,

593
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,180
all I thought about was him.

594
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,019
No, no,

595
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,259
get out, get out,

596
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,820
get out, get out, get out.

597
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,140
All these signs show that

598
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,620
you love him.

599
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:48,259
I love him.

600
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:49,900
When you can't see him,

601
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:51,779
you'll miss him.

602
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,259
A little bit.

603
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,699
You're watching him

604
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:04,620
every minute.

605
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,499
How do you know that?

606
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:08,939
Because so do I.

607
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,580
Qu Zheng

608
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:33,979
Yeah.

609
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,660
You beat me?

610
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:41,860
Did you try to burn me?

611
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,499
Did you? Did you?

612
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,779
I never said

613
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:46,860
I didn't mean it.

614
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,140
I did it on purpose.

615
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:49,380
I made you angry

616
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,140
on purpose

617
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:51,620
in front of Su Zhuozhuo.

618
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:52,620
I did it on purpose

619
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,580
to make you

620
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,180
speak your thoughts out

621
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,060
in front of Miss Jin.

622
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:58,380
I wanna hear you saying

623
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,420
you love me.

624
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,580
Do you admit it now?

625
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:22,779
I'm sleepy.

626
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,900
Why is it so hard

627
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,180
to make you say you love me?

628
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:41,259
Come on.

629
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,699
You big liar.

630
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:21,259
You've promised me,

631
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,459
you wouldn't lose this pendant.

632
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,979
You forgot.

633
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,100
Well,

634
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,739
even it is

635
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:32,660
from me,

636
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,699
you forgot too.

637
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,140
Make the little fox

638
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,900
as our

639
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,660
love token.

640
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,140
I hope you can keep it

641
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:53,620
and don't lose it.

642
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:01,939
Aren't you willing to?

643
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,580
I just thought

644
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,420
we've only known each other for a month,

645
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:11,459
and we don't know each other well.

646
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,580
That's because

647
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,019
since we came here,

648
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:17,900
you never told me

649
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,820
where you came from.

650
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,420
It's my master's order.

651
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:25,499
But I assure you,

652
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:26,860
I'm definitely not a bad person.

653
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:28,900
What my master let us do

654
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:30,699
were all good things that

655
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:32,219
maintained justice and punished evil.

656
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:35,380
Well, in that case,

657
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,580
I won't force you if you don't say.

658
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:40,180
Anyway, we still have

659
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:40,979
a lifetime

660
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,739
to be together.

661
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:45,140
Chu

662
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,620
Don't turn me down,

663
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,860
okay?

664
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,499
Do you accept?

665
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:01,620
The moonlight is so beautiful tonight,

666
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,140
let's make a vow under it.

667
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,739
Okay.

668
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:11,900
Moonlight in the sky,

669
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,259
witnessing my faith.

670
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,580
I will love Chu

671
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:16,939
for my lifetime.

672
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,380
From now on,

673
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,620
our commitment will never change,

674
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,820
we'll be together no matter life or death.

675
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,420
I swear to the moon,

676
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,660
I'll keep my words.

677
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:25,180
We'll won't be apart,

678
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,580
never and ever.

679
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,060
I, Chu, will do that so.

680
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,219
Cunning fox

681
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:57,779
Isn't it

682
00:28:57,939 --> 00:28:59,100
any trap, is it?

683
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,779
You said so,

684
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:03,939
do you go back on your word so soon?

685
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:06,580
No.

686
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:10,420
What if you do

687
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:12,660
as soon as we leave the valley?

688
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,459
What can you do then?

689
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,180
Well,

690
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,459
no matter up to the sky
or down to the sea,

691
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,019
even to the ends of the earth,

692
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,420
I'll find you.

693
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,779
When leaving the valley,

694
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,699
we made an appointment
to meet each other in three days.

695
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,860
But later,

696
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,019
you disappeared.

697
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,900
I've been looking for you for five years.

698
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,820
All is ready.

699
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:51,900
The last escort

700
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,939
will be right out.

701
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:56,380
It's her.

702
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,580
What's wrong?

703
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,620
The world, I'm on my way!

704
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,420
Chu

705
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,420
What?

706
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,259
She is Chu?

707
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,219
The plan has changed,

708
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,660
We also go to Furong Town.

709
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,380
What have you experienced

710
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,539
in the past five years?

711
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,299
She's asleep?

712
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,420
It was so treacherous on the way.

713
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:49,979
She may haven't slept

714
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:50,779
so peacefully

715
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:51,699
for a long time.

716
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,660
What do you wanna ask?

717
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:56,060
You've been looking for her for five years.

718
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,340
Finally, you made it,

719
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,299
why don't you tell her

720
00:30:58,499 --> 00:30:58,860
all the things before?

721
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,019
I'm the one

722
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,140
who got her involved in this for no reason.

723
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:03,779
Now there is still a big problem.

724
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:04,660
The less she knows,

725
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,340
the better.

726
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,499
When it is the right time,

727
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:11,900
I'll tell her

728
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
the whole thing.

729
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:16,699
That's your business,

730
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:17,499
I don't care.

731
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:18,660
However,

732
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,019
two days later,

733
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,499
it'll be the day to open the warehouse.

734
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,340
Are you sure he will come this time?

735
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,620
Since Puyuan Canon

736
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,660
can lead him to Yinxue Village,

737
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,140
this time,

738
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,299
he'll come for sure.
