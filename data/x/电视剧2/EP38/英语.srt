English subtitles are available

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Melody of Golden Age EP38

3
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
I won't make things too hard for them,

4
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,800
out of consideration for you.

5
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,440
I'll give you three days

6
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,720
to think it over.

7
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,320
I bid you farewell, Chancellor Lai.

8
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Poker face!

9
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,320
Poker face...

10
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Stop crying, Chui.

11
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm fine.

12
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
Really, I'm fine.

13
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
My dearest Xing,

14
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
you can't keep skipping meals.

15
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
Open the door.

16
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,120
I have a bowl of soup for you.

17
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
If you have any grievances,

18
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
just wait until you're fed,

19
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,000
and let's barge in the Shen residence!

20
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,000
I've also

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,960
been at death's door before.

22
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,480
It doesn't matter if he's The White Death

23
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,640
or the King of Hell;

24
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
your mother will

25
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,560
definitely make him cry out for mercy!

26
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,960
Darling,

27
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,760
I know you hurt inside.

28
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,320
But as a woman,

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,440
you need love and appreciation

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,920
to truly flourish.

31
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,120
Why keep someone

32
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
who doesn't appreciate you?

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
You can't let a little setback

34
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
bring you down, can you?

35
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,160
I promise you,

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,840
I will find you a caring and

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
handsome young man who will always

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
cherish you and listen to you.

39
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
How does that sound?

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,960
Hello there, handsome young man!

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
I came to check on Yan Xing.

42
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Xing,

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,480
It's me,

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
Pan Chi!

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,320
Xing!

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
She locks herself inside,

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,600
and refuses to comes out.

48
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,480
Come in.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,600
So she actually heeded my words?

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,080
My lady?

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,360
Madam Jin.

52
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
Did a strange man just

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,840
enter Xing's room?

54
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,320
My lady, what are you talking about?

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,560
What strange man?

56
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,200
Xing is an official of the Ministry of Justice.

57
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,360
She is not a typical house wife.

58
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Of course, she needs to people

59
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
to hand official business.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,360
Xing is indeed a capable lady.

61
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,200
Though she is not my biological daughter,

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
I have watched her grow up.

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Everyone knows!

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
When she married Shen Du,

65
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,040
I was quite concerned for her.

66
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
I hoped she would

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,520
find a good match.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,560
But now, having divorced

69
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,360
and returned to the Yan residence,

70
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
she should consider

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,280
the reputation of the Yan Family.

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,800
What do you mean by that?

73
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,600
Don't you know?

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
The entire Yan residence is now under the

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,920
watchful eye of the Imperial Inspectorate.

76
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
There are rumors circulating

77
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,080
that a daughter of the Yan Family

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
has become a discarded woman.

79
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,480
If strange men enter freely,

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
I fear people would think

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,480
that our Yan family lacks proper manner.

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
My lady!

83
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,560
It's clear that Xing

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,200
discarded that

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,000
heartless Shen Du.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,520
How dare you label her

87
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,480
as a discarded woman?!

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
For your information,

89
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,240
I've put up with you for far too long.

90
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,520
I'm done with this!

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,640
I was only trying to help...

92
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,400
What do you mean by "trying to help?"

93
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,680
Stop it! Please, stop!

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
Enough already!

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,520
Just stop!

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,640
Such a misfortune for the family!

97
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,520
You two, please stop!

98
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,200
Xing...

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
I was only trying to help, you...

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
You all, hush...

101
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,160
Mother, My lady,

102
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,880
please stop fighting.

103
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,920
Father.

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
We need to step out for a moment.

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,000
Ru,

106
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,680
-stop your nonsense! -Look,

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,040
isn't that a stranger?

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,120
Stop it!

109
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,280
You sure like to talk, huh?

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,160
Stop it!

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
My lord!

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,200
Why did you slap me?

113
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,120
Look at her!

114
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Do something about her!

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,920
Easy, you just hit my face!

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,400
You are...

117
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
You are from Tongming Pavilion.

118
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,240
You are Yan Xing, right?

119
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,720
Just turn left up ahead.

120
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
There's an alley.

121
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
You can exit from there.

122
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,560
No one will notice.

123
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
Why are you helping us?

124
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
For the bond of sisterhood.

125
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,240
For the women's virtue .

126
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,280
Thank you!

127
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Thank you so much.

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,360
Just hurry.

129
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,920
They're coming!

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,040
Sis!

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,680
Come on!

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,400
Xing.

133
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,880
Chui.

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Hurry.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,600
You finally made it!

136
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
I was worried you wouldn't make it here.

137
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,440
Fortunately,

138
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,560
it was a close call.

139
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
Has The White Death

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
truly joined forces with Lai Luozhi?

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,560
From this moment on,

142
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,920
I won't have anything to do with him!

143
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,840
How did you manage to evade

144
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,159
the men from Imperial Inspectorate?

145
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
You've been cooped up at home for days,

146
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,679
which has likely made them

147
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,880
let their guard down a bit.

148
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,039
It seems Chui

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,679
has grasped the meaning of my message.

150
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,640
Salt (Yan) has ears and eyes.

151
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,520
At the pool (Pawn, Chi) in three days.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,320
It means there are Lai Luozhi's

153
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,480
eyes all around the Yan residence.

154
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,840
In three days,

155
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,520
we will meet at the pawnshop.

156
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Lu Chuichui

157
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
is already waiting for us at the pawnshop.

158
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
We need to find a way

159
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,600
to bypass those lookouts.

160
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
For Zhanxin?

161
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,360
So she is a friend of

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,480
Kuang Zhanxin from Tongming Pavilion.

163
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
Then her assistance today

164
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,680
was because she believes

165
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,440
I cleared Kuang Zhanxin's name?

166
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Conducting investigations

167
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
are not for the sake of reward.

168
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,520
What we got in return today

169
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
is all due to kindness and goodwill,

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
helping one another.

171
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,680
Chui, now that

172
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,440
Lai Luozhi has the empire at his feet.

173
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,360
I've thought of a plan.

174
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,560
Why don't you and Jiang Langxing

175
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,000
just leave Xiang'an for now

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,240
to lay low until things calm down?

177
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,880
I played dumb with him yesterday,

178
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,120
so he will let his guard down for a while.

179
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,880
We can take this opportunity

180
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,760
to escape.

181
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,720
Xing,

182
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,840
why don't you come with us?

183
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,760
I still need to stay here.

184
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
Why?

185
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,240
You're not still hung up on

186
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,480
that The White Death, are you?

187
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Take care of yourself!

188
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,760
Chui.

189
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,200
Chui!

190
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
Father.

191
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,120
This is your first time traveling far.

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,120
Remember,

193
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,080
nothing surpasses the value of gold.

194
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
I have prepared

195
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
plenty of gold for you,

196
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,640
to ensure your journey is smooth.

197
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
Here, take it with you!

198
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,560
Stay safe on the road!

199
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,360
Be good!

200
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
Father...

201
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,520
Alright, just be good.

202
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,840
Chui!

203
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,040
Chui!

204
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,560
It's all good now!

205
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,920
Poker face,

206
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,680
you're leaving Xiang'an

207
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,320
for my sake,

208
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,760
and giving up your job as a delinquent.

209
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,000
Are there any regrets on your mind?

210
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,120
Do you wish things had been different?

211
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
As long as you are by my side,

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,040
wherever we go,

213
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,520
there will always be a place

214
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,880
for me to showcase my talents.

215
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
Exactly.

216
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,120
Then from this moment on,

217
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
we shall be a pair of

218
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,400
heroes, fighting against evil!

219
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,280
Wonderful!

220
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,760
Thank you so much!

221
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,240
Take care of yourself.

222
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,960
Farewell!

223
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,160
Let me carry it.

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,840
What do you mean they disappeared?

225
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,200
I've failed in my duties.

226
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
Lady Lu and Jiang Langxing

227
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,680
have truly vanished without a trace.

228
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm afraid they've already left Xiang'an.

229
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,400
Then head out of the city

230
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
and search the entire empire.

231
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,920
Leave no stone unturned

232
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,280
until you bring her to me!

233
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,920
Understood!

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,680
She was just deceiving you.

235
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
A woman like that,

236
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,520
why do you still hold onto her?

237
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,160
Get lost!

238
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,680
All of you, get out!

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
The commander of Dongzhou garrison

240
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,440
has come to pay respects to Chancellor Lai!

241
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,320
The governor of Yangyue requests an audience!

242
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
Legatus legionis from Yuan Legion greets Chancellor Lai!

243
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
My lord,

244
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,040
the road outside the residence

245
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,920
is packed with carriages of

246
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,960
civil and military officials

247
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,040
coming to pledge their allegiance,

248
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,000
and they refuse to budge.

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,720
Now,

250
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,800
seventy percent of the officials have

251
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,080
already pledged their allegiance to you.

252
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,280
We can't get things done with solely civil officials.

253
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,520
Any news from the regional commanders?

254
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,480
Various commanders of regional garrisons

255
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,640
have sent tokens of allegiance.

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,640
They all express the desire

257
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,160
to come to Xiang'an to pay their respects

258
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,800
to Chancellor Lai during the grand assembly.

259
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Excellent!

260
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,600
Four Imperial Legates from the six field

261
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
armies have already pledged their allegiance.

262
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,160
The remaining two are hardly a threat!

263
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,680
The second day of the second month...

264
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,360
It seems that

265
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,120
this specific date

266
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,200
is indeed a fortuitous day.

267
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Moths drawn to the flame.

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
fleeting in life,

269
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,520
they do not enter the cycle of reincarnation.

270
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,240
But are reborn anew.

271
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,000
The violet star rises,

272
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,560
heralding the empire's prosperity;

273
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,280
divine benevolence prevails,

274
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,280
uniting(Luozhi) the realm.

275
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,720
Divine benevolence prevails,

276
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,440
uniting(Luozhi) the realm.

277
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,040
Divine benevolence prevails,

278
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
uniting(Luozhi) the realm.

279
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,680
Xing.

280
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,000
Pan.

281
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,680
The Imperial Inspectorate

282
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,320
has not yet lifted

283
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,480
its watch over the Yan residence.

284
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,440
Aren't you worried about being implicated

285
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,520
by showing up like this?

286
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,080
If he wished me harm,

287
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,840
he would have done it earlier.

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,440
I'm simply accompanying you to unwind,

289
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,480
what's wrong with that?

290
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,520
I've heard that now the Imperial Guard

291
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
and the Imperial Inspectorate

292
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,200
are colluding.

293
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,040
Peaceful days in Xiang'an

294
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
may be lost forever now.

295
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,360
Listening to too many rumors

296
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,280
can be detrimental.

297
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,440
It's better to seek some fun.

298
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
My lady!

299
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,000
Chief Clerk, Lady...Yan...

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,800
Chief Clerk, Lady Yan,

301
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,400
you claim to be

302
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,520
dedicated to your duties,

303
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,240
yet here you are,

304
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,760
not in the Ministry of Justice,

305
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
but engaging in idle chatter

306
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,440
with a nobody?

307
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,760
Lord Shen,

308
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,680
she has finished her shift.

309
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,440
Though she's an official,

310
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,680
who she chats with and associates with

311
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,600
is probably none of your concern, right?

312
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Among all civil and military officials,

313
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
except for the Imperial Inspectorate,

314
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,120
who dares to defy

315
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,320
the orders from the Imperial Guard?

316
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Shen Du,

317
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,760
look at yourself.

318
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,600
People are talking that The White Death

319
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,840
and Dark Demon walk hand in hand,

320
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,920
so the realm is now a living hell.

321
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,240
Are you under the impression

322
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,560
that being shunned like a pariah

323
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,280
is a badge of honor?

324
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,800
Do you still remember

325
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,080
the promises you once made,

326
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,160
the oaths you swore?

327
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
People

328
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,760
will change.

329
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,160
Xing, don't

330
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,320
waste your breath on someone like him.

331
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,080
Let's go.

332
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,520
Xing,

333
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,600
just sit here for a short while.

334
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
I'll be right back.

335
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,680
Xing,

336
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
do you remember

337
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,440
this is where we

338
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,840
first met?

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,840
"The view manifests,"

340
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,520
"come noon it takes shape"

341
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,400
"and extends;"

342
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,720
"the essence rests in its form."

343
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,960
This is what you taught me.

344
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,760
From the moment we met,

345
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,400
I envisioned

346
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
what your future would hold.

347
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,560
You would become a

348
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,360
female official who serves the public,

349
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,120
leaving a legacy for generations to come.

350
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,280
Now, you are the only one

351
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,960
who still believes in my dreams.

352
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,560
In my eyes,

353
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,440
you have been more than someone's daughter

354
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
or wife.

355
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,200
You are Yan Xing, a female official

356
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,920
of the Ministry of Justice,

357
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
the most skilled detective in the empire,

358
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,560
and my soulmate.

359
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,120
I only wish

360
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,400
for you to pursue your ambitions freely

361
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
within the Ministry of Justice.

362
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,480
I will always be there,

363
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,600
silently supporting you.

364
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,040
But sadly,

365
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,440
everything has changed now.

366
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,400
The court is filled with hidden agendas.

367
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,440
There's no sense of fairness or justice.

368
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,000
You are caught in the crossfire,

369
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
suffering the consequences.

370
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,520
In this vast world,

371
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,680
being an official is not the

372
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,920
sole path to fulfill your dream.

373
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,080
Perhaps you are right.

374
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,240
With our combined strength,

375
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,200
we can travel the world,

376
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,040
righting wrongs and

377
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,440
clearing the names of the wronged.

378
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,120
Yan Xing,

379
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,480
would you like to join me

380
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
in escaping this place of turmoil

381
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,040
and journeying together across the world?

382
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Should you desire it,

383
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,240
I can take the lives

384
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,360
of these adulterous wretches

385
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,160
this instant.

386
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,800
If you let them go now,

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,040
you may never see them again.

388
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
That might be for the best,

389
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,640
to avoid the sight of them.

390
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,040
Rest assured, I will ensure the

391
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,680
Ministry of Justice clears the Shens' name.

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,120
It's just a matter of issuing a decree.

393
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,360
Anything else you need to inform your family?

394
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,200
I've already told my family

395
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,840
that I'm going out to travel for a while,

396
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,760
and they are very supportive.

397
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,800
With the vastness of the world,

398
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
one can cultivate an open mind

399
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,760
and not be burdened by trivial matters.

400
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,080
Once we leave the city,

401
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,520
all the conflicts and struggles

402
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,520
will no longer concern us.

403
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,120
With sky and earth as our shelter,

404
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,960
we will ride with the clouds and winds.

405
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Your Royal Highness.

406
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,080
Ease your mind.

407
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
I'm fine.

408
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm fine.

409
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,400
Your Royal Highness...

410
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,480
Some...

411
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Your Royal Highness,

412
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,480
please take your herbal medication.

413
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,560
News has arrived from the palace that the

414
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
Empress Dowager's condition has worsened.

415
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
It seems her time is running out.

416
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,760
In that case,

417
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,800
I should personally go to visit her.

418
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,280
Who is it?

419
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,480
Hearing Your Highness' health has declined,

420
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
I am deeply concerned.

421
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,520
I have come to check on you.

422
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,680
I am quite well,

423
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,160
just need to rest for a few days.

424
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,680
Ease your mind, Chancellor Lai.

425
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,000
Just focus on

426
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
your duties.

427
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,080
Be more mindful of your conduct,

428
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,760
to avoid being accused of lacking decorum.

429
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,360
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

430
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
It seems that

431
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,560
the news of the Empress Dowager

432
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,440
being gravely ill

433
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,960
is indeed true.

434
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,360
Insolence!

435
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,320
How dare you show

436
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,840
such disrespect in my presence?

437
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,400
Calm your anger,

438
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,360
for life is fragile.

439
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,600
Guards! Guards!

440
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,680
Have you come to assassinate me?

441
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,080
Your Royal Highness,

442
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
how could I have such wicked intentions?

443
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,720
I have always been

444
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,160
loyal and devoted.

445
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,320
Lai Luozhi,

446
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,120
you were born into humble beginnings.

447
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,880
If it weren't for me,

448
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,840
how would you have attained today's

449
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
wealth and status?

450
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,800
Yet you dare to harbor treasonous thoughts.

451
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,760
You are worse than an animal!

452
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,680
Had you not been so

453
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,640
suspicious and jealous,

454
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,080
unable to tolerate others,

455
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,960
this fate could have been avoided.

456
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,040
I believe I have acted justly before God,

457
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,400
with a clear conscience,

458
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,640
and have not failed the empire.

459
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,160
You, a lowlife, have no right to judge me!

460
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,400
What a fine statement about conscience.

461
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,640
But do you still remember

462
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,560
Consort Shu you framed, who was

463
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,480
driven to her death by your actions?

464
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,280
Consort Shu?

465
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,520
Who exactly are you?

466
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,120
What's your relationship with her?

467
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,720
That's right.

468
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,800
Within these imperial walls,

469
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,880
who would recall a woman presented

470
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,600
by a neighboring tribe,

471
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,560
a consort

472
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,280
forced to

473
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840
her demise,

474
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,280
much less

475
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,560
her offspring?

476
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,160
Zhi,

477
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
you must keep in mind

478
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,360
that it's Zhou Xu who caused my death!

479
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
Once your father passes away,

480
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,400
there will be no way for us

481
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,160
to survive

482
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,880
in the palace.

483
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,240
The queen and her supporters,

484
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
the Zhou Family,

485
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,200
hold all the power.

486
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,920
They will not allow

487
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,440
you to live.

488
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,840
But don't be afraid,

489
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,640
I will protect you.

490
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,680
Even if it costs me my life,

491
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,400
I will ensure your survival.

492
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,320
I will trade my life

493
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,440
for your chance at life!

494
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Zhi,

495
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
you must live.

496
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,560
You must survive.

497
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,160
Go and reclaim what is rightfully yours.

498
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,200
Do you understand?

499
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,720
Did you keep that in mind?

500
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,920
Zhi...

501
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,440
My nanny switched

502
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,600
her son with me.

503
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,240
From that moment on, I became Lai Luozhi,

504
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,040
and nanny's twin daughters

505
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,640
became my sisters.

506
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,240
Mother!

507
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,120
All that laugh, like moths drawn to the flame.

508
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,320
But they do not realize that like mayflies...

509
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,640
Mother!

510
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,480
After my mother passed away,

511
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,560
the high and mighty

512
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,960
Empress Dowager thought

513
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,840
this was merely

514
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,080
a scandal in the harem.

515
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,400
She decreed that no one

516
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,280
should discuss the matter in the palace.

517
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,640
Because of this,

518
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,480
the maid who came to the empire

519
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,760
with my mother,

520
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
my nanny,

521
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,520
managed to keep it a secret from everyone

522
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,120
and snuck me out of the palace...

523
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,080
So...

524
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,040
back then,

525
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,600
in the ruins...

526
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,280
the charred body of that boy...

527
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,320
That was my nanny's son,

528
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
who was about my age.

529
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,320
He willingly

530
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,240
walked into the fire for me!

531
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,960
Insane...

532
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,240
Truly insane!

533
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,440
All of this

534
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,560
is thanks to you!

535
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,400
You are the cause of this,

536
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,120
so I must

537
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,520
return this favor to you!

538
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,880
What do you want?

539
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,960
Your time is running out,

540
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
and the young emperor has yet to mature.

541
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,920
I believe it would be best

542
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,520
for this empire to be handed over to me,

543
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,280
his uncle.

544
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,560
This throne should have been mine.

545
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,560
Only by ascending can I better continue

546
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,920
the bloodline of the Xiao Family.

547
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,920
My father in heaven

548
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,400
would also feel comforted

549
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,840
for our ancestors!

550
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,800
I ask the Your Highness

551
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,560
to issue the abdication decree now.

552
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,320
Abdication decree?

553
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,160
What a delusion.

554
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,520
Come to think of it,

555
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,560
my sister, Princess Ying,

556
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,920
is still confined to her residence.

557
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,920
Also, the Prince Xian,

558
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,360
Perhaps I should begin

559
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,120
to plan for his future as well.

560
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,440
How dare you!

561
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,000
Now that I am the acting regent,

562
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,280
and you were the one

563
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,880
who brought me all the way up here.

564
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,120
Princess Ying conspired to rebel,

565
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,400
with irrefutable evidence.

566
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,400
It would be easy to dig up

567
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,360
some dirt on Lord Zhang,

568
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,680
so I could

569
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,240
frame Prince Xian.

570
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,640
You can't possibly be at a loss

571
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,360
for what to do next,

572
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,640
Your Highness.

573
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,400
I

574
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,200
entered the palace at fourteen,

575
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,480
and my whole life

576
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,280
has been spent in political struggle.

577
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,440
But ultimately,

578
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,520
I was still caught off guard.

579
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,240
You can wait until I die,

580
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,960
and then you can fabricate

581
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,520
all sorts of decrees as you wish.

582
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:40,040
You are nothing more than

583
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,880
a man hungry for power and fame,

584
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,680
aiming to

585
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,759
ascend to the throne with legitimacy.

586
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,560
The day of the grand assembly will also

587
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,640
mark the anniversary of my mother's death,

588
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,279
and it will be

589
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,600
your deadline.

590
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:56,640
By then,

591
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,279
my mother will see her son

592
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,799
returning with honor!

593
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,120
Her death anniversary will also

594
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,520
be the day her son ascends the throne!

595
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,560
Shen Du,

596
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
I understand what you intend to do.

597
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,160
Counting the days,

598
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,400
they should have arrived by now.

599
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,560
This is the boundary stone of Nanlang.

600
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,800
We have finally arrived.

601
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,400
Master!

602
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,400
Lord Chen?

603
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,680
Xing girl,

604
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,560
I received your message.

605
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,600
I thought you'd arrive soon,

606
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,960
but I didn't expect you to be this fast!

607
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,200
Master,

608
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,360
Lai Luozhi's men are everywhere

609
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,120
in Xiang'an City now.

610
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,960
To ensure our safety,

611
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,440
we didn't stop at all during the journey.

612
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,720
The truth you want to uncover

613
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,640
is indeed quite complicated!

614
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
It turns out that Xing

615
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
had already contacted Lord Chen

616
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,280
to secretly investigate

617
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,000
Lai Luozhi's background in Nanlang.

618
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,760
I heard from Chui that

619
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,280
on Lai Luozhi's mother's tombstone,

620
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
there's only the name "Biluo"

621
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,920
with no family surname attached.

622
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,080
So I had Ye Yun look into it.

623
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
He found that on the paper offerings,

624
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
there were drawings of conch shells (Luo),

625
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,880
which are rarely seen on

626
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,360
the ancestor worship paper in the empire.

627
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,720
However, I've heard that in Nanlang,

628
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,760
there're people who worship conch shells.

629
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,200
Ye Yun also discovered traces

630
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,640
of spilled cow's blood on the ground.

631
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,080
Using cow's blood as an offering

632
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,880
is indeed a custom of Nanlang.

633
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,760
Master,

634
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,840
could it be that Biluo was the consort

635
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,720
offered to the late emperor?

636
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
That's correct.

637
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,720
But this Biluo

638
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,720
has a hidden past

639
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,560
that few know about,

640
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,400
and perhaps even her own son

641
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,480
is unaware of it.

642
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,240
After tomorrow's grand assembly,

643
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,480
everything will be settled.

644
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,160
After all these years,

645
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,360
if she obediently

646
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,280
hands over the throne tomorrow...

647
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,080
It still feels a bit anticlimactic.

648
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,760
Long live the emperor!

649
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,040
The Xichen envoy offers tribute!

650
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,120
The Nanlang envoy offers tribute!

651
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,520
Today,

652
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,160
nations gather to celebrate,

653
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,920
joining in this grand occasion.

654
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,680
May we strengthen our diplomatic ties

655
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,640
and bring peace to the world!

656
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,760
With a solid foundation, the nation will thrive.

657
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,800
We must renew our commitment to the people,

658
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,480
so that all subjects unite as one.

659
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,080
Only then can we

660
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,760
shine for eternity.

661
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,680
By selecting only the virtuous,

662
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,480
we can surely stabilize the realm!

663
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
To maintain peace

664
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,080
is the responsibility

665
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
of a great nation!

666
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,560
Greetings, Your Royal Highness!

667
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,280
Love live the Empress Dowager!

668
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,440
The grand assembly

669
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,880
is a celebration for all.

670
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,880
Her Royal Highness is delighted,

671
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,280
so she even have recovered

672
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,240
and will grant a banquet for you all.

673
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,040
Gratitude, Your Royal Highness!

674
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,400
Now that Your Highness has recovered,

675
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
it's best not to overexert yourself.

676
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
If the illness relapses,

677
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,520
that would be unfortunate.

678
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,120
Do Your Highness have an edict

679
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,080
to announce to the officials

680
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,600
during the assembly?

681
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Chancellor Lai, you really are

682
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,000
becoming more and more disrespectful!

683
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,400
Thanks to your reminder,

684
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,720
I do have an important announcement.

685
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,240
I fell seriously ill not long ago, which

686
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,200
left me unable to attend to court matters.

687
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,880
Many affairs were temporarily

688
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,600
entrusted to the Imperial Inspectorate.

689
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,440
Chancellor Lai has worked diligently.

690
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,840
Now,

691
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,040
I have fully recovered, and His Majesty

692
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,400
is also studying the principles

693
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,600
of governance with the Grand Tutor.

694
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,240
From today onward,

695
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,960
Chancellor Lai will no longer need to

696
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,400
serve as regent.

697
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,920
You have fulfilled your role at the II.

698
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,120
Go and enjoy a tranquil respite.
