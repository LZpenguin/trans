Melody of Golden Age EP29

3
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
What?

4
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,840
You don't remember me already?

5
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Chen Huo'e?

6
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,440
I don't care who you are,

7
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,640
playing these tricks here.

8
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,759
I suggest you

9
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,960
hand over the antidote

10
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
before I get violent.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
Otherwise, I have no problem

12
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,920
killing Chen Huo'e again.

13
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,200
Anyone who's crossed swords

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,280
with me,

15
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
no matter how long ago,

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll recognize them.

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,960
Chen Huo'e and I fought many times,

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,760
so no matter

19
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,800
how hard you try

20
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,320
to hide your style,

21
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,600
it's pointless.

22
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,000
A fake is always a fake.

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,840
Too bad

24
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,560
there's only one vial of antidote.

25
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,400
Are you brave enough

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,280
to take it?

27
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,160
You're really

28
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,080
willing to risk your own life

29
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,520
for those people.

30
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,720
As for those worthless commoners,

31
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,960
I have no interest in them.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
The antidote is real.

33
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,760
Of course.

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,040
Your target

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
has always been me.

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Let's get it all out

37
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
in the open, shall we?

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,480
The poison on that porcelain bottle

39
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,160
is enough for you to enjoy for a while.

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,200
The toxin will

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,360
spread through

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,720
your bloodstream,

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,640
paralyzing

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,600
your whole body.

45
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Eventually,

46
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,199
you'll become

47
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,639
a breathing tree.

48
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,400
You're quite a handful,

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,440
aren't you?

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
Why not

51
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,000
just die

52
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
quietly here?

53
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,320
The true leader of the Fire Moth Sect,

54
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,880
your real boss,

55
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
is that person in the royal court.

56
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
You use Chen Huo'e's identity

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,000
to create havoc, switching identities

58
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,080
and expanding your influence,

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
not just to

60
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
establish a base in Yingzhou

61
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
but to covet all of Dacang.

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,280
You know,

63
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,520
the more you know,

64
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
the faster you die.

65
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,800
My mission this time is simple.

66
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,200
Wipe out you, Shen Du,

67
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,440
and your group.

68
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
Now,

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you're already in my grasp.

70
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
Who

71
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,960
will be next, I wonder?

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,720
My Lord!

73
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,920
Shen Du!

74
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,560
Guess which one I'll pick one?

75
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,080
Shen Du!

76
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,720
Shen Du!

77
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,320
My Lord!

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
My Lord!

79
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,120
Shen Du...

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
Shen Du...

81
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,560
Shen Du...

82
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
Shen Du...

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,360
Shen Du...

84
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,920
Shen Du...

85
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,480
Shen Du...

86
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,320
Shen Du...

87
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
Shen Du!

88
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,640
Shen Du!

89
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,920
He is poisoned by something strange.

90
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,560
Is there an antidote?

91
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
My medical skills are limited.

92
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,920
I can't tell what poison it is.

93
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,760
You can't tell?

94
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,440
The townsfolk got better

95
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
after taking the antidote

96
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,560
Mr Shen brought back,

97
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,000
but he...

98
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,880
These vile people

99
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,120
keep coming up

100
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,760
with bizarre poisons to harm others.

101
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,360
I swear,

102
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,200
I'll destroy their base!

103
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,039
Focus on saving lives first.

104
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,400
But I've already searched

105
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Guangchun Hall and the Mo residence

106
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,000
from top to bottom,

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,040
nothing about any poisons.

108
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,840
I'm one step away from turning over

109
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,400
every place

110
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,680
the Fire Moth Sect has ever been.

111
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
Chen Huo'e is sly and cunning.

112
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,400
She wouldn't leave the antidote

113
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360
out in the open.

114
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,880
Is Mr Shen getting better?

115
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,040
Acupuncture and sealing pressure points

116
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,080
are just temporary measures.

117
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
I haven't found

118
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,400
another way

119
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,040
to slow down

120
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
his body's stiffening.

121
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
If we don't find the antidote soon,

122
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,160
I fear he...

123
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,680
The poison affecting Shen Du

124
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,480
isn't one from the Central Plains.

125
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,240
I've translated books from the West.

126
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,920
The Fire Moth Sect's tricks

127
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,840
are strikingly similar

128
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,320
to the sacred arts

129
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,240
of the Jinwu Tribe legends.

130
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Then we should go seek help from them.

131
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,040
No.

132
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,360
Years ago,

133
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,680
the Jinwu Tribe cut off

134
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
all contact with Dacang

135
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,920
and showed strong hostility

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,320
toward its people.

137
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
If we rush in,

138
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
we might not save him

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,120
and could end up

140
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
trapped there ourselves.

141
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,920
Then what should we do?

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If I remember correctly,

143
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm the one here

144
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,640
most familiar with the Western Regions.

145
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
I'll go and fetch the antidote.

146
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,560
I'm going with you.

147
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,200
You need to stay here.

148
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,320
Shen Du risked his life

149
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,600
to protect the people of Yingzhou.

150
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,040
You should stay and protect him.

151
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
And you must also

152
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
look after Mrs Shen.

153
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,880
Fortunately,

154
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,200
the Jinwu Tribe isn't far from here.

155
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,760
Until I return,

156
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,400
don't do anything stupid.

157
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Thank you, Mr Pan.

158
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,360
I'll repay this

159
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,280
great kindness one day.

160
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,360
Take care.

161
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,640
Wait for me.

162
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,880
Hey there, traveler!

163
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
I've got some good stuff on me.

164
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,520
Come take a look.

165
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,120
Who are you?

166
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
I've got something good

167
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,880
to share with you.

168
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,600
You Dacang people are really slippery.

169
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
Shen Du,

170
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,480
I've cooled it down for you.

171
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
Just take a sip, will you?

172
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,040
Last time, didn't you say

173
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,840
your shoulder was hurt

174
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,840
and you couldn't drink on your own?

175
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,320
You said you'd only drink if I fed you.

176
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,960
Please, take one sip,

177
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,840
just one sip.

178
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,800
Shen Du, get up.

179
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,480
Look at me, Shen Du.

180
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
I miss you.

181
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,440
I miss you so much.

182
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,520
Has Mrs Shen

183
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,640
still not eaten anything?

184
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,240
She's been right by his bedside,

185
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,240
giving him acupuncture every hour.

186
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,760
No matter what anyone says,

187
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,560
she won't rest or let anyone get close.

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,040
If this keeps up,

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,960
she might collapse first.

190
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,040
What do you think we should do now?

191
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,720
If my calculations are right,

192
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,560
Mr Pan should be back

193
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,000
from the Jinwu Tribe by now.

194
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm just worried that before your lord

195
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,920
gets the antidote,

196
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,160
Mrs Shen might collapse first.

197
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Mrs Shen,

198
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,720
please take a break,

199
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,640
or at least eat something.

200
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,880
If he wakes up and finds out

201
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,920
you've exhausted yourself,

202
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,160
he'll be heartbroken.

203
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,680
I won't collapse

204
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,040
before he wakes up.

205
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,360
Mr Pan is back!

206
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,239
I was afraid if I didn't hurry back,

207
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,000
you wouldn't hold on any longer.

208
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,360
Did you find the antidote?

209
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,959
This is...

210
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:45,520
Su Guang,

211
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,280
the Holy Maiden of the Jinwu Tribe.

212
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,360
I told you

213
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,960
to bring him here quietly.

214
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,840
Bring,

215
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
not drag!

216
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,320
What happened?

217
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,680
He's extremely cunning.

218
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,160
I couldn't get him to come here nicely.

219
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,960
All right, all right,

220
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
just go. Go.

221
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,000
You're awake.

222
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,240
It's you?

223
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,160
It's the Ensnaring Vines.

224
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,760
Do you know of this poison?

225
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,240
This poison

226
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,120
is mainly made from wood moth larvae,

227
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,920
mixed with toxic plants

228
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
like Poison Arrowwood,

229
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Centenarian Flower,

230
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,200
and Western Monkshood.

231
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,360
Who would've thought a tiny moth

232
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,320
could make such a strong poison?

233
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,800
But this is a secret technique

234
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
only known to our Holy Maidens.

235
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,040
It's never shared with outsiders.

236
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,480
Then, how did

237
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,920
the leader of the Fire Moth Sect

238
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,320
get hands on such a hidden poison?

239
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,800
Could there be more to this?

240
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,600
Let me make it brief.

241
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,600
It's banned by our tribe

242
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,840
for being too malicious.

243
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,760
However, many years ago,

244
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,760
one of our Maidens disappeared,

245
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,280
and she's never heard from again.

246
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,000
So, it's possible that

247
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
the Maiden was

248
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,800
linked to the Fire Moth Sect

249
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,000
and shared this poison recipe.

250
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,560
Impossible!

251
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,440
That's Dai Si.

252
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,040
She would never collude with a cult.

253
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,320
You're the Holy Maiden.

254
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,440
You must have the antidote,

255
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,200
right?

256
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,440
Before I came,

257
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,280
I heard a bit about this from Pan Chi.

258
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,480
I searched through our texts

259
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,600
and made a special antidote.

260
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,960
I hope it works.

261
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm deeply grateful

262
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,040
for this antidote today.

263
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,360
You saved my life once,

264
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,960
and I promised to come with you.

265
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,080
But remember, this antidote

266
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,000
comes with its own price.

267
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
A gentleman's word

268
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
is his bond.

269
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,880
Mr Pan sure has a way with people,

270
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,920
even making romantic debts in the West.

271
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,640
Shen Du?

272
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,880
Shen Du, you're awake?

273
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
How do you feel?

274
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
Any discomfort?

275
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,080
Easy, slow down.

276
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
After sleeping for so long,

277
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,200
I've kind of missed you.

278
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,680
If you dare

279
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,760
scare me like this again,

280
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
I'll ignore you forever.

281
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,120
It won't happen again.

282
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
He's awake?

283
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,200
Hey, kid!

284
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,960
Some things aren't for you to see!

285
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,520
Call me a kid one more time,

286
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,560
and I'll get mad.

287
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,640
What?

288
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Wanna duel?

289
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,480
Kid.

290
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,720
Heaven watched over us to survive this.

291
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,920
What's with you, kid?

292
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,920
Didn't I tell you

293
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,720
not to look at things

294
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,160
you shouldn't?

295
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,560
Why don't you listen?

296
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,800
Shen Du,

297
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
I really missed you.

298
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,280
Seems like

299
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,480
you've put your heart into it after all.

300
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,280
You've been unconscious for days.

301
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,760
It's best not to drink too much tea.

302
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,680
Give me your hand.

303
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,400
Your pulse is steady.

304
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,120
Most of the poison has been cleared.

305
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,760
If you need anything, just say it,

306
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,320
whether it's food

307
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,640
or a bath and a change of clothes.

308
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
Don't move.

309
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,240
Do you feel any discomfort?

310
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,960
As for the situation in Yingzhou,

311
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,680
I've asked Jing Lin to watch it.

312
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,040
Sun Tan and the Delinquent

313
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,640
are maintaining order in the city.

314
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
This will all

315
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,000
be over soon.

316
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,200
What about the remaining Fire Moth Sect?

317
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,920
I've told Jing Lin to keep the news

318
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,360
of my recovery under wraps.

319
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,160
Do you think they'll believe it?

320
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,640
The point is to keep them uncertain.

321
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,080
What news have you gathered?

322
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,480
My Lord,

323
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
there's talk all over the city

324
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,760
that the White Death from the capital

325
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,960
is on his last breath.

326
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,880
And his wife,

327
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,440
before he's even passed,

328
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,080
has already cozied up

329
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,240
to that detective, Pan Chi.

330
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,800
I heard Mrs Shen

331
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,320
and Pan Chi go way back.

332
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,800
There's always been something fishy.

333
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,200
A woman's heart is deadlier

334
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,440
than a wasp's sting.

335
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,400
The camp was destroyed by soldiers,

336
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,040
but if Shen Du died,

337
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,520
chaos would surely follow.

338
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,720
The entire city of Yingzhou

339
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,600
will be yours for the taking.

340
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Just in case it's a trap,

341
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,240
investigate further.

342
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,880
Yes!

343
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,320
Is this cinnabar?

344
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,520
Yes, it fell off Chen Huo'e

345
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
during the fight that day.

346
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,720
I had Jing Lin

347
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,200
search Guangchun Hall again,

348
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,800
and they found traces

349
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,000
of cinnabar scattered in a corner.

350
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,840
Cinnabar is common in alchemy,

351
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,920
but it's very rare,

352
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,240
and worth a fortune.

353
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
Ten gold for a peck is fair.

354
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,240
Where did they get it?

355
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,200
If taken in small doses over time,

356
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,480
it can act as a preservative,

357
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,240
which is why their bodies

358
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,000
don't decompose after death.

359
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,880
So,

360
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,840
they've been preparing

361
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,800
this technique for their followers

362
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,160
to come back from the dead all along.

363
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,240
The extraction of cinnabar

364
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,280
is tightly controlled by the court,

365
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,000
yet the Fire Moth Sect

366
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,880
has it in abundance.

367
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,520
It looks like they've infiltrated

368
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
Dacang's mining operations.

369
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,560
Their ambition is far greater

370
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,120
than we imagined.

371
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,320
Are you saying...

372
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,880
the one behind

373
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,040
the Fire Moth Sect

374
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,800
is planning to...

375
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,800
Cry!

376
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,160
Cry for what?

377
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,920
I can't do it.

378
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,720
I've been waiting for you all.

379
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,240
You should try switching up

380
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,160
your Mindbender Mist.

381
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,440
So, you really are alive.

382
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Did you think I was made of paper?

383
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,960
You're not Chen Huo'e.

384
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,040
Can't you

385
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,720
show your real face?

386
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,840
Have you really figured it all out,

387
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,600
Shen Du?

388
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,040
Shen Du!

389
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,680
My Lord,

390
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,720
she escaped.

391
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,320
Keep an eye on them.

392
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,000
I want them alive.

393
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,120
Yes!

394
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,480
There's actually a way to

395
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,200
make something burn up that quickly?

396
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,160
It happened so suddenly,

397
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,680
and there was so much smoke at the time.

398
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,080
All I could smell was a sharp,

399
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
acrid scent.

400
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,960
What are you thinking about?

401
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,080
Remember the Holy Maiden Dai Si

402
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,280
I mentioned before?

403
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,800
Rumor has it

404
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,080
she developed a technique that

405
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,960
accelerates burning.

406
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,360
Not just a wall,

407
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,800
this entire courtyard

408
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,880
could be reduced to ashes

409
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,040
in an instant.

410
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,280
My Lord,

411
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,160
we've found a witness

412
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,080
from the granary fire years ago.

413
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,360
He smelt

414
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,480
an extremely

415
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,040
pungent odor

416
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,280
at the scene,

417
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,320
and thought that

418
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,640
the fire was quite strange.

419
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,200
It's surrounded by purple flares.

420
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,440
The Flame Accelerant Technique.

421
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,040
If used on a granary,

422
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,920
it'd burn down in half a day.

423
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,800
So,

424
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,160
Holy Maiden Dai Si

425
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,280
is likely connected

426
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
to the Fire Moth Sect.

427
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,120
What do you mean?

428
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,120
Su Guang, why are you here?

429
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,480
Even though Dacang rarely has dealings

430
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,280
with the Jinwu Tribe,

431
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,880
we know the disappearance of

432
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
your Holy Maiden was a big deal.

433
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,920
How calm you are!

434
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,200
It's likely there was a plan all along.

435
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,360
I didn't intend to hide anything.

436
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,160
Dai Si

437
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,720
eloped with a man from Dacang

438
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,280
and disappeared without a trace.

439
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,880
The chieftain wanted to keep it quiet.

440
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,240
But in recent years,

441
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,480
techniques and formulas

442
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,880
known only to our Maidens

443
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,640
have surfaced multiple times.

444
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,000
I thought

445
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,720
we must find out the truth quickly

446
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,680
to prevent any unforeseen trouble.

447
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,680
A man from Dacang?

448
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,040
Jing Lin.

449
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,720
My Lord.

450
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,440
Report to the capital.

451
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,880
The crisis in Yingzhou is resolved.

452
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,560
Yes.

453
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,359
You've been pacing outside for ages.

454
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:07,520
Finally decided to come in?

455
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,319
Not exactly playing the guest, are you?

456
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,240
There's something I wanna say,

457
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,000
but I'm not sure if it's the right time.

458
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
If not,

459
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,040
then keep quiet.

460
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,720
Stick to your promise

461
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,120
and divorce Yan Xing.

462
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,040
But who exactly are you

463
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,840
to tell me this?

464
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,680
A friend dressed up

465
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,800
as a woman?

466
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,680
Just a couple in name only.

467
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,600
As the mighty lord,

468
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,080
you seem awfully confident.

469
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,480
Some things

470
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,880
are better left unsaid.

471
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
How will you make she happy when

472
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
you live on the edge as White Death?

473
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,880
My wife's well-being

474
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,080
isn't

475
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,320
your concern.

476
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
As long as I'm around,

477
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,520
no one will lay a finger on her.

478
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,720
You've got

479
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,640
quite the ego.

480
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,040
I wonder

481
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520
what she sees in you.

482
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,240
Fine,

483
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,320
since you've made your point,

484
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,240
make sure you stand by it.

485
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
If not...

486
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,520
If not, what?

487
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,880
Then I'll

488
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,400
find her

489
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,280
and take her away,

490
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,200
no matter where she is.

491
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
You've seen how close

492
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,440
Yan Xing

493
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,680
and I are.

494
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
Let me make this clear.

495
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,320
That day will never come.

496
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,000
You'd better hope so.

497
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,360
Are you leaving with the Holy Maiden?

498
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,400
Aren't you just as curious

499
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,920
about what happened

500
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,440
to Dai Si?

501
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,240
She's not just anyone.

502
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,600
You'd better make sure she's safe.

503
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,080
Such a shame

504
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,040
to break a perfectly good cup.

505
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,360
What a waste.

506
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,920
What a fool.

507
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
Thanks to you risking your life

508
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
to get the antidote from Chen Huo'e,

509
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,560
the townspeople

510
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
who were poisoned

511
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,240
have all recovered quickly.

512
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,440
Seeing them healthy

513
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,080
and back to their peaceful lives,

514
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,800
it makes

515
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,560
all the hard work

516
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,840
worth it.

517
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,560
Mr Shen.

518
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,640
thank you.

519
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,800
Thank you so much

520
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,200
for saving me

521
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,000
and all the people

522
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,400
of Yingzhou.

523
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,560
You're a good official.

524
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,440
This is just a little something from us.

525
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,320
Please,

526
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,880
don't refuse it.

527
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,800
Just take it.

528
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,360
Thank you

529
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,920
for saving our lives.

530
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,560
Thank you.

531
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,640
This is a small token of our gratitude.

532
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,400
My Lord,

533
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,480
this is a little gift from me.

534
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,520
Please, you must accept it.

535
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,400
Thank you, sir.

536
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,000
Thank you for saving our lives.

537
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,800
Mr Shen is truly a good man!

538
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,560
We will never

539
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,040
forget

540
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,240
your kindness.

541
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,560
Yes, thank you.

542
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
Thank you, thank you!

543
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,160
You're all too kind.

544
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,200
This is what he's

545
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,160
supposed to do.

546
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,040
Really, there's no need.

547
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,080
Please, don't say that.

548
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,680
We insist.

549
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,840
-Please don't refuse. -Just take it.

550
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,200
Thank you, my lord.

551
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,000
Thank you.

552
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
Mr Shen is such a good man!

553
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,760
Quit smiling.

554
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
Help me hold some of these.

555
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,360
These are all gifts for you.

556
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,920
You should be the one

557
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,880
to carry them.

558
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,840
It's their heartfelt gratitude for you.

559
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,800
You should

560
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,960
spend less time with Pan Chi.

561
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,320
You'll pick up his rebellious streak.

562
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,560
and silver tongue.

563
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,000
He didn't even

564
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,400
say goodbye before leaving.

565
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
He must've gotten on your nerves.

566
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,440
The connection between

567
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,080
Dai Si and the Fire Moth Sect

568
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,200
is no small matter.

569
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,320
I have a feeling

570
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,800
he had other intentions for his trip.

571
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,000
Even better.

572
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,480
If he dares make a move

573
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,640
on someone else's wife again,

574
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,720
I'll break his legs.

575
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,960
Is my lady embarrassed?

576
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,520
People are watching.

577
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,760
I'm cold.

578
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,600
How about now?

579
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,640
Come a little closer.

580
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,480
I'm holding something here.

581
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,480
Closer...

582
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm cold.

583
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,160
Really.

584
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,080
You better not tease me again.

585
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,040
Much warmer now.

586
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,480
Shen Du,

587
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,480
it's snowing! Come outside!
