Melody of Golden Age EP16

3
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You didn't sleep well, did you?

4
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,880
You wouldn't listen when I told you to

5
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,800
go home, insisting on going

6
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,440
to the History Archive to look for leads.

7
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,280
Looks like you didn't find any leads,

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,040
but you've caught a cold instead.

9
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,200
Don't get me started.

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,440
There were so many.

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
All those pages.

12
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,520
Those men sure can write.

13
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
Every tiny little detail

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,320
was documented!

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
You didn't stay up all night, did you?

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,760
I couldn't sleep anyway.

17
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,080
I think you should

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,320
go back to the Shen residence first.

19
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,240
At most,

20
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,600
just say a few

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,200
flattering words to Chief Shen.

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
Why me?

23
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm just stating the facts.

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,440
I saw what happened

25
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,120
with my own eyes yesterday.

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
Maybe you really

27
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,880
misunderstood him

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,000
this time.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
What did I misunderstand about him?

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,400
The day you were taken,

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Lai Luozhi showed up quickly,

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,920
but thankfully, Chief Shen

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,040
also arrived in time.

34
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,760
The reason you're able to clear your name

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,880
so quickly

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,240
was all because of him.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
It's only been a few days,

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
so many new sects

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
have already emerged,

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,160
all claiming they can resurrect the dead

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
and grant immortality.

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,040
I've already sent people to investigate,

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,960
but most of them

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
are constantly on the move,

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,600
mainly spreading heretical beliefs.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
It's difficult to predict their next move.

47
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,320
The Fire Moth Sect?

48
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,360
This Fire Moth Sect

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,480
stands out

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,680
as the most powerful.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
There's even a rumor that

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
their core figure is none other than

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
Chen Huo'e, the one who was resurrected.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Mom!

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Let's go.

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
Wait, it's not finished yet.

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,640
Xing, what...

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,960
Mom,

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,440
what are you doing here?

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,040
I came to pray for you and your father.

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,160
Don't believe everything you hear.

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's go.

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,200
Get away from here.

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,120
But the...

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,640
-The apparition is about to appear! -Let's go.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
What's going on?

67
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
No one

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,400
is to gather here without cause.

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,120
Leave here at once!

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
Why are you asking us to leave?

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
We didn't do anything wrong.

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,400
Those who try to stop the Fire Moth Sect

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,120
will face divine retribution!

74
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Arrest them all!

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,120
All of you

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,560
will face retribution!

77
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,560
You will face retribution!

78
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,800
You will face retribution!

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,440
Let go of me.

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,440
Let's go.

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,200
Mom,

82
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,640
what were you doing there?

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,920
It was so dangerous.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,640
Keep your voice down.

85
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
I was just

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,320
praying for you and your father,

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,440
so you could live a long life

88
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,000
free from harm.

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,000
It's all lies.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Throw this away right...

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,920
No, don't!

92
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,320
There will be retribution.

93
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,960
The holy relic of the Fire Moth

94
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,640
is the embodiment of a deity

95
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,720
and must not be violated.

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,720
Anyone who offends it

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,960
will be tied up

98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
in the shape of a moth

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,880
-and burned as punishment. -Mom,

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,440
where did you hear all this?

101
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,600
Where what?

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,440
Even children on the street know that

103
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,240
those who offend the Fire Moth Sect

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,200
will be burned alive!

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
I didn't expect that this

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
had already bewitched so many people.

107
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,560
I must investigate this thoroughly.

108
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,880
Mom,

109
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,720
if you keep getting involved in this,

110
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,440
it could get you killed.

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,960
Listen to me,

112
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
stay at home.

113
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
Don't go anywhere these days.

114
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,200
I will take this.

115
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Wait.

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
Give it back.

117
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,280
You ungrateful daughter, give it back!

118
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
Wait, you!

119
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,160
Just... Just don't offend them

120
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,560
and don't rebut them!

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,240
So hot.

122
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,640
Fire!

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,800
There's a fire at the History Archive!

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
Fire! Fire!

125
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,720
Quickly!

126
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Go get water!

127
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,240
Go get water quickly!

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
Here! Here!

129
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,440
Go get water!

130
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,520
Quickly!

131
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,400
Go get water!

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
Over here!

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,800
-Here! -Quickly!

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,240
Over here!

135
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Go get more!

136
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,800
Xing!

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,280
Xing!

138
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,440
Quickly!

139
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,120
Go get water!

140
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Shen Du!

141
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,400
Shen Du.

142
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,120
Xing.

143
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,280
You're awake.

144
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,680
You took in a lot of smoke.

145
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
Get some rest these days.

146
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,160
And thank you for saving me.

148
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,400
Get some rest now.

149
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,960
Don't talk too much.

150
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
Sometimes, I tend to

151
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
speak without thinking.

152
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,560
If I had said something offensive,

153
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,800
don't take it to heart.

154
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
I got it.

155
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
Do you think

156
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,640
the fire might have been set on purpose

157
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,520
to destroy

158
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,200
the county chronicles and records inside?

159
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,240
Or maybe you were the target.

160
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,560
Me?

161
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,960
Are they afraid I'll find out the truth?

162
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,800
I doubt we could find anyone else

163
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
bold enough like you.

164
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,080
What are you doing?

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
I got this powder at the site of the fire.

166
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
What is it exactly?

167
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,560
Perhaps only my master

168
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,800
would know what this is.

169
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Be careful.

170
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,080
What's wrong?

171
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,840
Are you not feeling well?

172
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,480
No.

173
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
I... I'm fine.

174
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,000
Now do you know

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
how dangerous it is outside?

176
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Get some rest.

177
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,040
Stop running around.

178
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
Master,

179
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,120
we're just having tea.

180
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,840
Why did we have to

181
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,040
come all the way here?

182
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,040
Only here

183
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,640
can you find the taste you truly desire.

184
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
If you don't believe, try it.

185
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,840
You're not drinking tea.

186
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,880
You're chugging it!

187
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,600
Master,

188
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
this power was found at the crime scene.

189
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
It was also found

190
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
at the old site of Jinxiu Shop.

191
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
But we don't know what it is.

192
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,160
Don't smell it.

193
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,560
Interesting.

194
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,880
Highly flammable.

195
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,760
Leaves no traces.

196
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,920
It's not something common wizards

197
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
would use.

198
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
It might be

199
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,520
from a foreign land.

200
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,920
A foreign land?

201
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
Maybe someone at the Gui Market

202
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
will know where

203
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,400
this comes from.

204
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,680
Master,

205
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
it's really a shame for someone with

206
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,240
your talents to stop working on cases.

207
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,080
You've already mastered

208
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,440
nearly everything I know.

209
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,720
Maybe

210
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,520
it's time for me to step back.

211
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,960
At my age,

212
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,600
I just want some peace of mind.

213
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,320
Live one day at a time

214
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,280
and make the most of each day.

215
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,400
As long as I can enjoy my tea

216
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,960
and live at ease everyday,

217
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,720
I'm content.

218
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
It's hot!

219
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,160
You

220
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,840
are just too impatient.

221
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,480
It's the same with cases.

222
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,560
If you rush for results,

223
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,160
you are likely

224
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,080
to be misled

225
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,400
by what you see.

226
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,720
Misled by what you see?

227
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
That's right, master.

228
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,960
The evidence I have now

229
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,360
feels like

230
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
it was deliberately

231
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,400
fed to me.

232
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,720
Investigating

233
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,080
isn't just about uncovering the truth.

234
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,240
It's also a contest

235
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,480
with an unseen enemy,

236
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,240
to see who can

237
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,840
seize control of the situation first.

238
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,040
If

239
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,440
the Jinxiu Shop case back then

240
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,480
was meant to suppress Princess Runing,

241
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,600
and undermine the ties among

242
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Her Highness, the Princess and

243
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
the influential Xiao gentry behind her,

244
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
then it's still unclear

245
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,120
what the person behind this is after

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
this time.

247
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,240
Stay calm.

248
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,520
Solving cases is like savoring tea.

249
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,480
It requires a lot of efforts.

250
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Everything is like savoring tea to you.

251
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
That's exactly so.

252
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,040
It's also like this between a couple.

253
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,800
Master,

254
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,880
I'm talking about the case!

255
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,760
And I mentioned nothing else.

256
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,080
Discuss heroes over wine,

257
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,040
discuss love over tea.

258
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,640
The more

259
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,600
you savor this tea, the richer the flavor.

260
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,000
People are the same.

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,960
Only time reveals their true nature.

262
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,080
Good tea.

263
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
Such good tea!

264
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,720
Xing, wait!

265
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
Come here.

266
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,040
Didn't I

267
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
tell you to rest at the Shen residence?

268
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,199
Wu Taiming, that crafty old man,

269
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,840
was worried you'd bring bad luck

270
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,080
and didn't want you to come.

271
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,520
It's all my fault.

272
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,720
Ji Fangming didn't get implicated

273
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,800
and get scolded, did he?

274
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:34,840
He's the guardian of the History Archive,

275
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,320
and the place was nearly burned down.

276
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,080
But Wu Taiming

277
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,600
dared not to be angry at you.

278
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:39,720
So Ji Fangming

279
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,480
took all the blame.

280
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,160
I should think

281
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,880
how to apologize to him.

282
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,560
By the way,

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,280
from what I heard,

284
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,320
you were carried out by Shen Du

285
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,840
in front of everyone.

286
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,160
What else could he do?

287
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,840
Watch me die?

288
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,720
Look at you.

289
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,320
Like a mule,

290
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,800
you're so stubborn!

291
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,800
Look at you.

292
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,680
Always talk without thinking.

293
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,000
You have no filter.

294
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
Look at you yourself.

295
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,360
You've only gone back for a day,

296
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,160
and you're already radiant.

297
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,880
Let me see

298
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,640
what tricks the Shen residence has that

299
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,720
have made you

300
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,920
so bright-eyed!

301
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,360
But,

302
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
it might really be true.

303
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
I fell asleep as soon as I lay down

304
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,600
when I went back last night.

305
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,560
Perhaps it's because

306
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm used to sleeping with the lights on

307
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
and the lights burning all night there?

308
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,560
Here, however,

309
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,880
I find it hard to sleep.

310
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,320
Sure.

311
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm serious.

312
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,160
This is...

313
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,840
My savior,

314
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,120
to express my gratitude,

315
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,200
I've specially prepared

316
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,760
some dishes that can

317
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,800
help with your eye recovery.

318
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,480
From now on,

319
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,160
I will keep preparing nourishing meals

320
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,080
for you, my lord.

321
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,680
I will continue this

322
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,320
until your eyes are completely recovered.

323
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,240
Why aren't you eating?

324
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,120
Is the Chief of IG

325
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,920
a picky eater?

326
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,320
Or you're not hungry?

327
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,960
This is

328
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,280
all from my heart!

329
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,760
Don't waste the food.

330
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,080
I should go now.

331
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,320
What's the hurry, my lady?

332
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
When did you pick up

333
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,920
a new bad habit of

334
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,120
needing a company for meals?

335
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
Isn't this all from your heart?

336
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll eat better

337
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,840
looking at you.

338
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,720
I said,

339
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,200
what's the hurry, my lady?

340
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,360
You're a grown man.

341
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,280
Do you

342
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,440
need someone to feed you?

343
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,920
This meal is truly thoughtful.

344
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,320
My lady,

345
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,840
eat.

346
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,600
From now on,

347
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,240
remember to dine with me everyday.

348
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Will you agree?

349
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,080
Living under someone else's roof,

350
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,520
do I have any choice?

351
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,440
As long as you know that.

352
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,200
What's wrong?

353
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
You have no table manners.

354
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
That's not true.

355
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
That's not true!

356
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,720
What is this?

357
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,520
This is true harmony.

358
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,720
Others can only be so envious!

359
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,480
This must be what they mean by

360
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
thick as thieves.

361
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,600
I just wonder

362
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,040
how much longer can they keep this up.

363
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,600
Every debt has its own debtor.

364
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,160
Leave me alone!

365
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,160
Leave me alone!

366
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,080
Leave me alone!

367
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,320
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

368
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,880
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

369
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

370
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

371
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,880
Leave me alone!

372
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,960
My lord,

373
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,880
when we got here,

374
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,440
he was tied to the roof eaves.

375
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,000
We didn't want to disrupt the scene

376
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,960
and waited for you to decide what to do.

377
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,960
My Lord,

378
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,320
Chen Shoujie is still alive.

379
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Fortunately, those we sent to watch him

380
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,520
managed to save him just in time.

381
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,200
However,

382
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,880
he seems to have been severely shocked.

383
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,640
He was already quite unhinged.

384
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,120
Now

385
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,840
he can't even speak

386
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,880
a complete sentence.

387
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
It's exactly like

388
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,560
what happened at Furong Theater.

389
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,440
Han Shiyuan and Caiwei

390
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,240
were also tied up and hung high,

391
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,240
with burning charcoal below.

392
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,600
But it was the cold flames

393
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,640
used in Western Regions' acrobatics.

394
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,640
Looks like

395
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,520
they are about to kill.

396
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
Who is it?

397
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,240
Not only did they want to kill him,

398
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,440
but also with such cruel method.

399
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,000
Let's go.

400
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,520
How did this fire happen?

401
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,600
It's so tragic.

402
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,760
Who is that?

403
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,360
Why is he hiding?

404
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,440
Jing Lin.

405
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,200
What's going on?

406
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,920
What's going on?

407
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,560
They arrested someone.

408
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,520
It's you.

409
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,520
This is Ji Fangming,

410
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,000
the guardian of

411
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,800
History Archive at the Ministry of Justice.

412
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,640
We still need your testimony and seal

413
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,280
regarding the fire at the History Archive.

414
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,960
I was just on my way to the Shen residence

415
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,080
when I saw you

416
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,960
hurrying here.

417
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,960
My Lord,

418
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,120
someone was burned to death east of here.

419
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,840
What?

420
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,360
Burned to death?

421
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,080
Who was it?

422
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,480
A guard from the IG,

423
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,240
squad leader Sun.

424
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Him?

425
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,920
Do you know the Fire Moth Sect?

426
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Fire Moth Sect?

427
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,840
It was Chen Huo'e

428
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,320
who punished this person in person.

429
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,800
You know,

430
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,000
the fire at

431
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,760
the Ministry of Justice a few days ago

432
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,120
was to punish

433
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,320
Mrs. Shen!

434
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,400
Mrs. Shen?

435
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,920
She almost died!

436
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,840
Maybe the White Death

437
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,800
has done so many bad deeds that

438
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,520
retribution has fallen upon his wife.

439
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
The wind and rain come at night,

440
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,080
yet one remains as steady as a clock.

441
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,160
Too much late-night food,

442
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,720
better go with a few more drinks.

443
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,560
Did you find out where that powder

444
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,680
came from like I asked you?

445
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
It's from the Western Regions.

446
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,680
Quite mysterious indeed.

447
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,040
I

448
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,400
have put in quite a bit of efforts

449
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,440
to find out.

450
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,440
You want to ask me for more money?

451
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,640
No way.

452
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,320
You memorized the secret code for nothing.

453
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
Did you really come here empty-handed?

454
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,840
You could

455
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,680
at least bring a couple of bottles of liquor

456
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,920
to reward me.

457
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,600
If you admit

458
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,080
you're the renowned

459
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,320
detective Pan Chi,

460
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,080
I might consider

461
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,240
treating you

462
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,840
to the finest osmanthus wine in Xiang'an.

463
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,880
I am him.

464
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,880
If I really were him,

465
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,680
would you truly

466
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,520
pay me

467
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,320
some more?

468
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,240
You wish.

469
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,680
It sounds nice just thinking about it.

470
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,160
You should go home now.

471
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,800
It's not safe at the Gui Market lately.

472
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,840
My Lord,

473
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,640
you've asked me to look into

474
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,720
Ji Fangming from the Ministry of Justice.

475
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,600
I found out that

476
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,240
he has written

477
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,320
a prescription for himself.

478
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,080
He was sick?

479
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,920
I didn't know that

480
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,400
he has some medical knowledge.

481
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,560
We followed him for a few days

482
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,480
and found that

483
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,440
his health is quite poor,

484
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,640
most likely a chronic illness.

485
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,320
Give this prescription to the pharmacy.

486
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,920
I want to see

487
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,840
just what kind of illness does he have.

488
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
Are you suspecting him, my lord?

489
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,720
The fire at the History Archive

490
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,120
was too much of a coincidence.

491
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,640
Chief Shen must be busy.

492
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm just here to ask

493
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,040
what kind of tea does he want.

494
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,160
There's no need.

495
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,920
Miss Yun Que, please go back.

496
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Did you find anything about

497
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,240
the Jinxiu Shop case?

498
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,840
Don't worry, Miss.

499
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,760
When it's necessary,

500
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,280
Chief Shen will tell you.

501
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,560
I got it.

502
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
This powder

503
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,800
was ground from a plant

504
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,920
unique to the Western Regions.

505
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,640
When burned,

506
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,560
they release a distinctive aroma

507
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,920
that can cause those who smell it

508
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,400
to feel unusually excited

509
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,960
or even hallucinate.

510
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,760
It is said

511
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
that if someone

512
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
gives some subtle hints,

513
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,880
people who smell the powder

514
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,240
might experience

515
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,400
the same hallucinations.

516
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,400
Is there someone

517
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,920
selling this at the Gui Market?

518
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,240
No.

519
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,160
I heard this plant

520
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,200
is very common in the Western Regions,

521
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,320
but it is difficult

522
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,120
for it to survive

523
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,320
outside its specific soil.

524
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,640
So, to maintain

525
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,440
its strong

526
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,920
hallucinogenic effects,

527
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,680
the powder

528
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,920
cannot be stored for too long.

529
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,880
Could it be

530
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,120
that someone has managed to cultivate

531
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,240
this plant secretly in the capital?

532
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Is this information true?

533
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,560
My friend, Pan Chi,

534
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,680
from the Gui Market told me this.

535
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,280
His information wouldn't be wrong.

536
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,560
Did you know Ji Fangming was sick?

537
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,840
Only focused on some friend, you've

538
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
overlooked the clues in front of you.

539
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
At Chen Shoujie's residence,

540
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
his appearance and reaction

541
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,040
were indeed very suspicious.

542
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
The others were all curious

543
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,840
about what had happened,

544
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,880
but he was more interested in

545
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,760
our reaction to what we had seen.

546
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,680
That's right.

547
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,960
I also remember

548
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
smelling a faint scent

549
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,480
on Ji Fangming once.

550
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,880
I didn't pay much attention at the time.

551
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,200
Thinking back,

552
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,520
that scent was very familiar

553
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,680
but is quite rare.

554
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,040
I've only smelled it in one place before.

555
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,280
Mingsheng Temple.

556
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,960
He's been to Mingsheng Temple?

557
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
I asked Chuichui

558
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,320
to look into Ji Fangming's background

559
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,400
and gather some information

560
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,680
on him.

561
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,440
He got into the Ministry of Justice

562
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,960
through someone's recommendation.

563
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
Guess who it was?

564
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,880
Was it...

565
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,800
Yes.

566
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,400
It was Chen Shoujie.

567
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,000
But besides that,

568
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,520
his past was quite clean.

569
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,520
We didn't find anything suspicious.

570
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
The cleaner the more suspicious it is.

571
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,160
There must be more to it.

572
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,960
Chen Shoujie had

573
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,760
done him a favor and recommended him,

574
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,320
but the other day at the crime scene,

575
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,560
he pretended not to know him.

576
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Chen Shoujie recommended him?

577
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,080
But I have checked and found

578
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,200
that they have no connection whatsoever.

579
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,200
So that means,

580
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,800
there must be a mediator

581
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,240
that connects the both of them

582
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,320
that we have not

583
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,760
found yet.

584
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,080
Looks like

585
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,960
I'll have to ask them myself.

586
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,560
Ji Fangming,

587
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,600
here.

588
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,360
Ms. Yan,

589
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,640
this is?

590
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,320
Finally, no more dealing

591
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,920
with those fragmented records.

592
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,240
So...

593
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,160
you found the culprit?

594
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,160
Yes, we did.

595
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,320
Chen Shoujie

596
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,560
was behind all these cases.

597
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,880
He was pretending to be dumb,

598
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,800
misleading everyone.

599
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,560
But,

600
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,160
he was just talking nonsense.

601
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,400
What?

602
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
He confessed?

603
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,440
Yeah!

604
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,720
Don't you know who my husband is?

605
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,360
He's the one people call the White Death.

606
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,920
Chen Shoujie

607
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,920
confessed everything within a day.

608
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,080
He was playing dumb?

609
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,520
How could it be possible?

610
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,560
Why isn't it possible?

611
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It was him

612
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,760
who deliberately hid crucial evidence

613
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,920
in the Jinxiu Shop case,

614
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,400
causing so many innocent deaths.

615
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,680
He was bribed

616
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,920
with a thousand taels of gold

617
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,720
and he buried them in his own yard.

618
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,360
It took

619
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,520
several hours

620
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,440
to dig up the taels.

621
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,800
I never thought,

622
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,120
truly never thought

623
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,520
he would hide it this well.

624
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,960
Yeah.

625
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,240
If it weren't for my husband's sharp eyes,

626
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,160
we would still be deceived.

627
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,160
Is he still being held

628
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,560
at the IG?

629
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,720
He's in the prison of the Ministry of Justice.

630
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,600
The execution

631
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,200
will be carried out in secret tomorrow.

632
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,600
Carried out in secret?

633
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,560
Why?

634
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,960
It's the officials' order.

635
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,360
There might be

636
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,400
more to this case

637
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,880
than meets the eye.

638
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,880
If Princess Runing

639
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,960
was truly wrongfully accused

640
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,520
and confined at Mingsheng Temple,

641
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
then the Jinxiu Shop

642
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,920
was merely

643
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,640
a pretext

644
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,160
to frame the princess.

645
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,880
What?

646
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,320
You are saying that

647
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,000
all those lives at the Jinxiu Shop

648
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
were only...

649
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,240
You can't say that out loud.

650
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,480
That's why

651
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,120
we had to stop the investigation.

652
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,760
It's all my fault.

653
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,280
It's all my fault.

654
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,320
It's all my fault.

655
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,960
Who made you to kill over a

656
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,080
dozen people at the Jinxiu Shop?

657
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,680
Still playing dumb?

658
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,320
Today, you'll face your own death!

659
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,520
You're not Chen Shoujie?

660
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,040
Those who offend the Fire Moth

661
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,600
will suffer the Fire Moth's punishment!

662
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,799
Ji Fangming,

663
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,880
it's really you.

664
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,480
You said those things

665
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,279
to me on purpose to lure me here.

666
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,840
You've had many chances

667
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,279
to kill Chen Shoujie,

668
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,400
but you didn't.

669
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,960
So we figured,

670
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,640
maybe what the culprit wanted

671
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,040
was not for Chen Shoujie to die,

672
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,520
but to torture him.

673
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,720
No one wants him to be lucid

674
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,920
more than the culprit,

675
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,160
so the torture

676
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,920
will be more satisfying.

677
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Ji Fangming,

678
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,640
now that we have all the evidence,

679
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,200
do you have anything else to say?

680
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,320
I'm not the culprit.

681
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,840
And I don't know

682
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,360
how did I end up here.

683
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,040
Maybe I was misled by someone,

684
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,240
and came here unconsciously.

685
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,200
My lord, my lady,

686
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,120
you've seen

687
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,240
such things before.

688
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
Surely you can understand.

689
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,640
I have no reason

690
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
to kill Chen Shoujie.

691
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,800
It was for Kong Xianrong, the owner of

692
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,920
the Jinxiu Shop, wasn't it?

693
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,040
It's been so many years,

694
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,440
and few dare to mention the names of those

695
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,360
involved in the Jinxiu Shop case.

696
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,520
I never expected

697
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,960
someone still remembered his name.

698
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,720
You burned down the

699
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,240
History Archive at the Ministry of Justice

700
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
not just to harm me,

701
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,960
but to

702
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,560
destroy everything there,

703
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,720
to erase any traces

704
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,640
showing you,

705
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,000
Chen Shoujie, and Jinxiu Fang's owner,

706
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,560
Kong Xianrong,

707
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,920
knew each other.

708
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,240
Clerk Yan,

709
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,000
are you going to

710
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,240
convict me just based on this?

711
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,800
So you admit?

712
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,760
Xianrong and I met first.

713
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,160
We made our acquaintance

714
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,920
for avoiding rain in a teahouse.

715
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,400
Xianrong was eloquent

716
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
and talented.

717
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,200
We hit it off right away

718
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,320
and had a great conversation.

719
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,960
And soon we became close friends.

720
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,560
After I failed the exams,

721
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,480
he introduced me

722
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,920
to Chen Shoujie,

723
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
allowing me to become an official.

724
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,600
Yet,

725
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,640
as fate would have it,

726
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,200
Jinxiu Shop was wrongly accused

727
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,600
and Xianrong's whole family was killed.

728
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,320
I stood in the crowd,

729
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,400
watching them die.

730
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
The blood was flowing like a river.

731
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,080
How did you know

732
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,200
Kong Xianrong was framed?

733
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,640
Over the years,

734
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,080
I went through every county record

735
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
and criminal case file.

736
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,160
And it finally paid off.

737
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,600
I finally found

738
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,480
a lead.

739
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,240
Xianrong saw Chen Shoujie as a brother,

740
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,320
but Chen Shoujie

741
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,560
betrayed this trust

742
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,880
for his own interests.

743
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,640
So,

744
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,080
you killed his wife

745
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,880
and went to great lengths

746
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,040
to torture Chen Shoujie?

747
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,000
She deserved to die!

748
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,240
His wife deserved to die!

749
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,800
Chen Shoujie even more so!

750
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Was the murder of

751
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,200
squad leader Sun

752
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,240
your doing?

753
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
What does his death

754
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,920
have to do with me?

755
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Then who taught you to impersonate

756
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,920
Chen Huo'e and commit these crimes?

757
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,200
Like a moth to a flame,

758
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,240
here today and gone tomorrow,

759
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,800
escaping the cycle of reincarnation,

760
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,600
yet immortal forever and ever.

761
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,200
Take Ji Fangming to the dungeon

762
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,720
and await further orders.

763
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,360
I avenged the

764
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,760
innocent people at Jinxiu Shop.

765
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,640
I didn't do anything wrong!

766
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,680
I didn't do anything wrong!

767
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,320
Chen Shoujie deserves to die! To die!

768
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,880
Is the food not good today?

769
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,040
Why are you not talking?

770
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,640
Provoking Ji Fangming

771
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,920
was a very reckless move.

772
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,520
If anything happens...

773
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,560
But I got him to confess, didn't I?

774
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Sometimes,

775
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,240
simple and direct methods

776
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,040
work best.

777
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,920
The rest

778
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,560
is up to how you,

779
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,360
the chief of IG,

780
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,720
will conduct the interrogation.

781
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,720
I'm afraid this is not that easy.

782
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,520
Ji Fangming is already in custody.

783
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,800
If we find enough evidence to convict him,

784
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,480
can the case be closed?

785
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,840
If Ji Fangming was

786
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,000
indeed behind all of it,

787
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,080
then closing the case

788
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,320
would be fine.

789
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,640
But there's a thing

790
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,120
that doesn't seem right.

791
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
In what way?

792
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,760
The deification of the Fire Moth Sect

793
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,000
is going faster

794
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
than we thought.

795
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,680
Someone deliberately committed a crime

796
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,880
in the east of the city

797
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,760
at the same time

798
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,560
when Ji Fangming tried to kill Chen Shoujie

799
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,320
shows a total lack of concern.

800
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,760
The Fire Moth Sect.

801
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,960
Could the one behind it

802
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,360
really be

803
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,000
Chen Huo'e, who was resurrected?

804
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,920
Your cooking skills

805
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,280
haven't improved at all.

806
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,400
But after a while,

807
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,280
it doesn't taste so bad anymore.

808
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,920
Even if my skills haven't improved,

809
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,720
your appetite has grown.

810
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,040
That's what counts.

811
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,200
The man you caught

812
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,680
was avenging the Jinxiu Shop case?

813
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,520
I risked my life to get the

814
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,800
evidence about the Jinxiu Shop,

815
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,560
so I want to

816
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,800
go with you too to the interrogation.

817
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,280
Ji Fangming,

818
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,400
you killed

819
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,040
Chen Shoujie's wife,

820
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,120
and are arrested

821
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
while trying to

822
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,360
murder Chen Shoujie.

823
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,080
What had really happened,

824
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
and who else were you working with?

825
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,560
Confess truthfully.

826
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,880
Such an imposing presence, my lord.

827
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,480
I've seen plenty of this posturing

828
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,000
at the Ministry of Justice over the years.

829
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,280
This doesn't work on me.

830
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,440
Ji Fangming!

831
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,280
At this point, just be honest and confess.

832
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,400
Don't try these useless tricks.

833
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,760
If you wouldn't say it here,

834
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,240
then we'll take you to the IG.

835
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,200
I have plenty of methods to make you talk.

836
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,400
My lord, so you're going to

837
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,400
force a confession through torture?

838
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,120
Chancellor Lai, you're just in time.

839
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
It's better to be timely than early.

840
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,200
If I hadn't come,

841
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,120
how could I have witnessed

842
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,960
such a display of authority of yours?

843
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,400
This case has been fully entrusted

844
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,200
by Her Highness to the IG.

845
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,840
I will handle this matter properly.

846
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,840
You just stay aside and observe.

847
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,160
Don't cause any trouble.

848
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,880
Or you'll be charged with

849
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,160
obstructing the investigation.
