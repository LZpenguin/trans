English subtitles are available

00:01:41,520 --> 00:02:03,240
Melody of Golden Age EP05

3
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,800
Regarding today's incident,

4
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,160
thanks for your rescue.

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
I believe

6
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,240
you should be thanking someone else.

7
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,320
This writing does resemble mine a lot.

8
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,120
But still, it could not deceive you.

9
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
Not just me.

10
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,600
The Great Grandmother?

11
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,920
It sounds upright and unyielding.

12
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,600
But between the lines,

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
there are hints of a woman's touch.

14
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,160
Yan Xing was

15
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
earnestly endorsed by the prime minister.

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,440
Now, she intends to help you.

17
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
I find

18
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
the turn of events quite surprising.

19
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,960
Why did Her Highness...

20
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,000
You've found yourself a good wife.

21
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,200
She must

22
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,520
have taken that nursery rhyme

23
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,480
to heart.

24
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
The task you're assigned

25
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,280
is indeed a challenging one.

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,200
You must be cautious.

27
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Absolutely.

28
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
It seems I misjudged Her Lady.

29
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,120
She has shown loyalty

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,360
since your arrest.

31
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,920
I could speak for myself

32
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,080
even if she didn't write the statement.

33
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,600
Saving me is merely a pretext.

34
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
She aims to use this opportunity

35
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,960
to overturn the case of Chen Baiyi,

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
and that is her true intention.

37
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,360
She had the guts to take advantage of you?

38
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,560
She actually has the audacity to use me!

39
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,680
What a cunning girl!

40
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Never mind.

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,880
She's just trying

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,480
to seek justice for Chen Baiyi.

43
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,880
But how did she learn

44
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
my handwriting?

45
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,080
She

46
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
entered your study.

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
No wonder she could imitate it perfectly.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,919
I didn't expect

49
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,159
her to have a talent for mimicking.

50
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
My Lord,

51
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,320
she tampered with your memo.

52
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,520
Should we...

53
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,160
Just keep her around.

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,360
What other tricks could she pull?

55
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,680
There's something

56
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
that needs immediate attention.

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,520
Your Highness, Your Highness!

58
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,400
This is not good!

59
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,960
He... he's coming...

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,160
Prince Xian, receive the decree.

61
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,360
I, Xiao Zhong, am receiving the decree.

62
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
By the mandate of heaven,

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,960
the emperor hereby decrees:

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,640
I hereby order the Prince Xian, Xiao Zhong

65
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,040
to proceed to Fengxiang to conduct an inspection.

66
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,400
Prince Xian, Xiao Zhong,

67
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
with both literary and martial prowess,

68
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,520
possessing the ability to govern,

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,760
with benevolence as his foundation,

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
endowed with righteousness and courage,

71
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
with both virtue and talent,

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
to benefit the populous.

73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,480
A harsh drought is now plaguing Fengxiang.

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,280
Planning and coordination are imperative.

75
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
The regent holds the authority to govern.

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
The duty of inspections falls to you.

77
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
Supervision is entrusted to you.

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,960
This is to enhance our imperial prestige,

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,360
and to reassure the hearts of the people.

80
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
May imperial grace bless the people.

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,120
I, Xiao Zhong,

82
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,720
gratefully accept the decree.

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
When are we scheduled to depart?

84
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,560
Your Highness,

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,160
Her Highness has issued a decree.

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,960
This matter is of utmost importance.

87
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,120
There can be no delays whatsoever.

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,320
Your Highness' journey will be

89
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,720
fully escorted by the Imperial Guard.

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,960
The CO has made necessary arrangements.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,120
Please rest easy and prepare to set off.

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,880
Very well.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,240
While I'm away,

94
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,880
you must

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,200
take excellent care of these flowers.

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,320
Temperature fluctuations are significant.

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
Watering during the hour of the snake(9am) is ideal.

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,640
Especially my

99
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,960
Imperial Yellow Peony.

100
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, Your Highness.

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,840
Let's go.

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Your Highness,

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,800
please.

104
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,880
I wonder if the statement worked.

105
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,720
My Lady!

106
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
My Lady,

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,560
I've received the news from the palace:

108
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,080
the commander has left the palace alive.

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,240
You can rest easy now.

110
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,040
Please get some rest.

111
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Alright.

112
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,480
I'll wait a little longer.

113
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,400
My Lady.

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,520
My Lady,

115
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,600
here's the osmanthus lotus seed soup.

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
Please enjoy it while it's warm.

117
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,000
This maid seems unfamiliar.

118
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,680
Greetings, Lord Prime Minister.

119
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,080
Lady Yan Xing of the Yan Family,

120
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
you truly are exceptionally clever.

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,560
Shen Du was taken to the palace earlier,

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,960
and he has yet to return home.

123
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,200
You may leave empty-handed

124
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
if you're looking for updates on the case.

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I am aware of Shen Du's whereabouts.

126
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,240
Today, I came to see you

127
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,000
to grasp the Yan Family's stance.

128
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,480
I don't quite understand.

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,840
Please enlighten me, My Lord.

130
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,160
Her Highness was enraged upon hearing

131
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,040
the rhyme that has been circulating.

132
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,200
She immediately issued a decree

133
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,680
ordering Prince Xian to proceed to

134
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,840
Fengxiang to oversee disaster relief.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,880
When he departed, he wasn't

136
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,480
even permitted to bring attendants.

137
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,600
Moreover,

138
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,240
the route has been kept confidential.

139
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,000
My Lord, are you implying

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,720
that Her Highness suspects Prince Xian

141
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,760
is behind the nursery rhyme incident,

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,920
and intends to take action against him?

143
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,680
However,

144
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,119
blood is thicker than water.

145
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
It's a long and risky journey.

146
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,960
If something were to happen,

147
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,720
it would be too late to act.

148
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,600
Let me ask you,

149
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,680
the Great Grandma wields absolute power,

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
disregarding the rightful ruler of Cang.

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
What's the surname of the late Emperor?

152
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
Does the Yan Family

153
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
still have clarity on this?

154
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm fully committed to criminal cases.

155
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,280
As for political matters,

156
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,760
a mere woman truly lacks understanding.

157
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,240
It's even more challenging to be involved.

158
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,880
What a naive girl!

159
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
You wish to enter the court,

160
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,280
while also being embroiled in the case,

161
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,880
and still hope to remain unscathed.

162
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,400
Not only you, Yan Xing,

163
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,840
but your entire family is

164
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,680
deeply entangled in all this.

165
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Her Highness values the empire above all.

166
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
Perhaps my husband is mistaken.

167
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
A serial case,

168
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,880
and a nursery rhyme,

169
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,760
could they truly

170
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,360
spark such an uproar?

171
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,560
The Buddha Absorbs Sins.

172
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,520
This nursery rhyme is indeed malicious,

173
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,320
accusing Her Highness of illegitimacy.

174
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,520
If it were to affect anyone,

175
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,240
it'd not be limited to just Prince Xian.

176
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,840
What exactly do you want me to do?

177
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
According to my sources,

178
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
Shen Family employs carrier pigeons

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,240
for sending orders and relaying messages.

180
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,640
During Prince Xian's journey,

181
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
they will certainly

182
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,920
use pigeons to relay messages.

183
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,440
You need to act fast

184
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,280
to uncover Prince Xian's route.

185
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,760
At that point,

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,280
whether Shen Du is

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,920
plotting to assassinate him

188
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,400
or genuinely trying to protect him,

189
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,520
we will be prepared in advance.

190
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,120
Carrier pigeons?

191
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,080
Why do you

192
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
act so secretively even at home

193
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,720
as if you're a thief?

194
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,760
My Lord,

195
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400
I have been eagerly

196
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,720
awaiting your return.

197
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,160
When did you get home?

198
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,080
Did Her Highness give you a hard time?

199
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,200
You made me worry all night.

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,040
Yan Xing,

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,280
why put on such a facade?

202
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,240
Do you believe that by acting like this

203
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,560
you would win my favor?

204
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,760
Not falling for this trick, huh?

205
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,280
Never mind.

206
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,360
Are you content now?

207
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,280
As a clerk in the Ministry of Justice,

208
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
you must be well aware of the

209
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
consequences of forging memos.

210
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
Moreover, your careless words have

211
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,040
stirred quite a commotion in the court.

212
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,080
At that moment,

213
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
I was simply desperate to save my husband.

214
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
I hadn't written any memos before.

215
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,960
How could I know what should be written

216
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,040
and what shouldn't?

217
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Saving me?

218
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,920
Or rather using me?

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
The hour grows late.

220
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,400
Lord Commander,

221
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,880
let's head inside and get some rest.

222
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,040
Humble-born scholar Chen Baiyi,

223
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,520
self-immolated in Ming Hall.

224
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
His years of hard works

225
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,360
have all been stolen.

226
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,320
There has been no sign of divine favor.

227
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,840
When will this corrupted social ladder end?

228
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,920
Everyone,

229
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,760
why do we labor over our studies,

230
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,400
only to serve as mere

231
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,080
companions to the sons of the gentry?

232
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,680
We are reduced to their shadows.

233
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,680
We refuse to accept this!

234
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,320
We will no longer tolerate it!

235
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,320
Look at you all, so pathetic.

236
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,800
Without the gentry,

237
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,240
you wouldn't even be worthy

238
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,040
to step foot in the Imperial Academy.

239
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,640
Craving success?

240
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
For your information,

241
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,000
you were born to be lowly.

242
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,000
What did you say?

243
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
You plagiarizing nobodies.

244
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,680
Stop!

245
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,000
Stop, all of you!

246
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Stop, now!

247
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Hey!

248
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,400
This is outrageous!

249
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,120
Outrageous!

250
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,280
Repetitive and monotonous,

251
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,680
utterly meaningless.

252
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,480
Regarding the Ming Hall self-immolation,

253
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,480
Imperial Guard,

254
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
any updates?

255
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
Your Highness,

256
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,520
Imperial Guard

257
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,200
has further verified and confirmed

258
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
that it is indeed as previously stated.

259
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,240
The scholar Chen Baiyi had his writings

260
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,160
stolen by the eldest son of the Jins.

261
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,200
When he confronted him, he was driven out,

262
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,840
and publicly humiliated and beaten.

263
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,000
He was filled with deep resentment.

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,920
With no way to appeal to the officials.

265
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,240
Self-immolation was his chosen statement.

266
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,200
The Imperial Academy is still in chaos.

267
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,480
The unrest has not yet settled.

268
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,920
News has arrived from Jiangnan.

269
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Look!

270
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,200
Take a look!

271
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Though papers traverse the earthly path,

272
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,400
they seldom tread the way of justice;

273
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,320
passing the roll may pass the test,

274
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
yet hardly heralds fairness to the world.

275
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,800
Is this how the scholars

276
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,880
perceive the social ladder

277
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
of our Great Cang Dynasty?

278
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,440
Your Highness, please quell your wrath.

279
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,240
Mother, selecting talents

280
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,600
is a matter of national interest.

281
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,920
The gentry should not use this

282
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,480
to uphold their status,

283
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,960
causing such turmoil.

284
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
I believe that

285
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,720
whether from humble backgrounds

286
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,840
or from the gentry,

287
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,240
they should be competing together.

288
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
Weigh their talents, select the competent.

289
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,560
This should be the way forward.

290
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,480
I believe this is not acceptable.

291
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,320
Nepotism in office is a dynastic rule.

292
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,600
How can it be changed so easily?

293
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,600
Your Highness, perhaps you spend your days

294
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,720
reciting poetry with

295
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,080
those humble students, and have

296
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,080
momentarily lost sight of reality.

297
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,520
Those of humble origins

298
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
are equally subjects of our empire.

299
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
I merely speak on their behalf.

300
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,440
Why are you reacting with such intensity?

301
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,520
Lord Zhang, were you

302
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,920
aware of the plagiarism scandal

303
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
involving the Jins

304
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,800
from long ago?

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Please, Your Highness,

306
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,400
I am solely

307
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,840
concerned with the welfare of the empire.

308
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
We can't focus solely on the writings.

309
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
Family scholarly heritage is also crucial.

310
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,080
Lord Zhang, this viewpoint is misguiding.

311
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,400
Clinging to the privileges of the gentry

312
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
has led to

313
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,960
widespread corruption and malpractice.

314
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,240
Let the worthy hold their due places.

315
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Your Highness,

316
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,200
the victims of the Ximing Temple cases

317
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,120
were all sons of the gentry.

318
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
It's possible

319
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,480
that some humble student was misled

320
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
into committing those acts.

321
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,800
Misled?

322
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,840
It's better to guide than to suppress.

323
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Ultimately, suppression

324
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
won't resolve the issue.

325
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Such a simple truth.

326
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,840
How could you not grasp it, Lord Zhang?

327
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,560
Could it be that

328
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,960
you wish for Her Highness to bear

329
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,160
the blame for the injustices

330
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
against the humble families of the realm?

331
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,160
My loyalty to Her Highness

332
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,920
is as clear as day.

333
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,680
Recruiting officials of humble origins

334
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,920
is absolutely unacceptable.

335
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,160
Your Highness!

336
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Alright, Lord Zhang,

337
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,640
you may get up.

338
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,840
You two are in disagreement, but it's

339
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,200
all for the greater good of the empire.

340
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Lord Shen,

341
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,640
regarding the self-immolation case,

342
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,400
haven't you already solved it?

343
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,440
What is your take on this?

344
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,080
Among the scholars of humble origins,

345
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
there are indeed talented individuals

346
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,040
who genuinely deserve an opportunity.

347
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,200
I believe

348
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,360
we could implement a method for

349
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,480
fair assessment to identify the talented.

350
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
Then they can offer themselves for your review.

351
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,280
I suggest starting with

352
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,600
the Imperial Academy as a pilot program,

353
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,520
choosing talents of humble origins.

354
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,160
Your Highness' wisdom shines!

355
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,720
Oh, it's you

356
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,320
Miss, sit here, please.

357
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,280
Sit.

358
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,840
Thanks to you,

359
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
my poor grandson

360
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,720
could finally rest in peace.

361
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,040
Lord Commander,

362
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,840
what should we do with these remains?

363
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,960
Your grandson's articles have

364
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,680
received high praise from the scholars.

365
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
I brought a copy for you.

366
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,160
Unfortunately,

367
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,080
I cannot read.

368
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,720
Let me read it for you.

369
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,360
The Song of the Western Continent.

370
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,240
Reflecting on the plum blossoms.

371
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,840
Sending plucked plums across the river.

372
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,400
The apricot blossoms bloom red...

373
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,880
Her Lady is

374
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,560
truly eager to take on responsibilities.

375
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
However, the fairness and justice

376
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,560
she seeks are not easily achieved.

377
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,480
Aren't you a big surprise?

378
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
You are quite the strategist.

379
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,040
What's the matter?

380
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,360
Her Highness' issued an edict to establish

381
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,240
the Imperial Academy as a pilot program

382
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,680
to select humble talents for enrollment.

383
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,040
Is that true?

384
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,040
I mean

385
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,920
Xing won't take credit for this.

386
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,560
It all hinged on your mediation.

387
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,400
This time,

388
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
you will surely earn a reputation

389
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
for keen insight

390
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,440
among the humble students.

391
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,200
How wonderful!

392
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,040
Xing is genuinely happy for you.

393
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,600
Do I care about those?

394
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,720
If you plan to pull any stuns again,

395
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,680
make sure to inform me in advance.

396
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,280
Otherwise, you'll be punished severely.

397
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,080
Yeah,

398
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,960
you're the White Death after all.

399
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,320
Reputations surely means nothing to you.

400
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,240
At this late hour,

401
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
what trouble are you going to stir up?

402
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,280
I'm just going to stretch a little.

403
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll go for a jog.

404
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,040
If I don't run, I won't get tired.

405
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,360
Then how could I possibly fall asleep

406
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,320
next to the White Death?

407
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,520
My Lady.

408
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,400
Does she go for a jog every night?

409
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,480
She believes it helps her sleep.

410
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
It's indeed too bright in here.

411
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,480
We haven't changed the lighting at all.

412
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,080
It's still the same as it was.

413
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
Do you all find it too bright?

414
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,840
We've already grown accustomed to it.

415
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,640
I recall

416
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,880
there's a type of fabric from Xichen

417
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,040
that can effectively block out light.

418
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,880
Go and make a curtain from it.

419
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,080
Yes, My Lord.

420
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
Also,

421
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,360
don't light it up

422
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,520
from that side anymore.

423
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,920
Let's conserve the oil.

424
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,960
My Lord.

425
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,960
Sir!

426
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,400
You've already barged in.

427
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
Come on in.

428
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
Get down...

429
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,480
The identities of the twelve victims from

430
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,960
Ximing Temple have all been confirmed.

431
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
These paired corpses

432
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
were mostly familiar with each other,

433
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,880
often seen together.

434
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,320
However, only two pairs

435
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,120
have not been found

436
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,040
to have any connections.

437
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,520
Isn't it said

438
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,200
that the IG is very efficient?

439
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,280
It's been so long.

440
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,360
Why haven't you uncovered?

441
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,480
The male corpses are all gentry.

442
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,400
Based on their appearances

443
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,200
and clothing,

444
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,280
they can be identified quite easily.

445
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
But the female ones

446
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,840
have had their features marred.

447
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,840
They don't have household registration,

448
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,080
so it took some time to identify them.

449
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,120
Additionally,

450
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
the timeline of their disappearance

451
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
does not align with

452
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,680
the time of death.

453
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,840
A discrepancy?

454
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,920
Is this also true for the male victims?

455
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,680
Yes, it is.

456
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,800
It ranges from two to three months,

457
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,440
up to one to two years.

458
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
After the murderer abducted the victims,

459
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,840
they were being held for so long.

460
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,640
That certainly would increase the risk.

461
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,040
As for the female victims, do they

462
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,280
match the list of missing musicians

463
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,640
provided by the inspectors?

464
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,360
Exactly.

465
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,200
They are indeed the missing musicians

466
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,080
from various music halls.

467
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
So you're saying they were all musicians?

468
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes.

469
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,120
That doesn't seem right.

470
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,880
What's not right?

471
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,920
The accessories found

472
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,520
on those female corpses

473
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,200
seem a bit off.

474
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
Please take a look at this.

475
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
It's truly exquisite.

476
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,120
The quality is clearly outstanding.

477
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,480
Indeed.

478
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,960
I found it odd that day.

479
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
These gold ornaments,

480
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
compared to other accessories,

481
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,320
seem excessively exquisite.

482
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,280
They aren't like ordinary goldsmith work.

483
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,680
These items

484
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,520
shouldn't be easily accessible

485
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,960
to ordinary musicians.

486
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,560
I'm not very knowledgeable about these,

487
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,760
but Chui mentioned

488
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,320
that renowned craftsmen

489
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,880
often leave their marks

490
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
on their creations.

491
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
This piece is from the Bijiang Workshop.

492
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,840
It was once part of the royal forge,

493
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,040
crafting jewelry for the royal family.

494
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,520
It has surpassed many

495
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,120
renowned shops in 10 years,

496
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,560
and risen to the top.

497
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,440
Thank you for coming!

498
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,160
Welcome to our humble shop.

499
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,760
What can I do for you?

500
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,680
Hairpins.

501
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,800
Bring out your

502
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
finest collection.

503
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Certainly.

504
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
Which one do you favor the most?

505
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,280
This one.

506
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,680
You have a discerning eye!

507
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,520
How much is this?

508
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,640
Fifty taels.

509
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,640
I thought so.

510
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,520
Ordinary musicians can't afford this.

511
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
Darling,

512
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,120
I'd like to get the best one.

513
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,600
Once the owner shows up, could you

514
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
get him to show us his hidden treasure?

515
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,680
The Zisun tea is a royal tribute.

516
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,480
Especially the Yangxian type

517
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,720
is considered a top-tier delicacy.

518
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,840
Previously, I was fortunate enough

519
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,760
to receive some as a reward.

520
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,920
I've kept it at home, reluctant to drink.

521
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,720
Your establishment is quite generous.

522
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,360
This is our owner's cherished treasure.

523
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,520
We are pleased to offer it to

524
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,720
our most distinguished guests.

525
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,040
Has the manager not here yet?

526
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,960
Greetings, Mr and

527
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,360
Mrs Shen.

528
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Your presences honor our humble shop.

529
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,600
What can I assist you with?

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,520
If I recognize you correctly,

531
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
you are Ms. Yang,

532
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,960
the chamberlain to Princess Ying.

533
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,280
You truly have a keen eye.

534
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
You still remember a lowly servant like me.

535
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,200
I'm truly flattered.

536
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Do you recognize

537
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,120
these gold ornaments?

538
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,040
Some of them

539
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,280
indeed come from the Bijiang Workshop.

540
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,760
Excellent.

541
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,920
I want the list of people who purchased

542
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,640
these items.

543
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,760
Sir,

544
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,840
this is quite a challenge for me.

545
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
Our shop has been open for years,

546
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,520
with countless customers coming and going.

547
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,960
The amount of jewelry we have sold

548
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,480
over the years is immeasurable.

549
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
How could I remember every transaction?

550
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,320
A hairpin that costs fifty taels is

551
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,120
so pricey that even if a commoner

552
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,640
sold everything he owns,

553
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,360
he wouldn't be able to afford even one.

554
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I can't provide the list.

555
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Then you might as well just tell me

556
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,680
who can provide it.

557
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,560
Um...

558
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,560
This is official IG business.

559
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,200
If you dare to hide anything,

560
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,280
just face

561
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,920
the consequences.

562
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,760
Please wait, sir.

563
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,640
I'll go fetch it right away.

564
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,880
This one looks good.

565
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,680
Let's take this one.

566
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,000
The design is simple.

567
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,760
It suits you perfectly.

568
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Are you giving this to me as a gift?

569
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
You're not expecting me to

570
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,000
pay for it, are you?

571
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,720
The accessories worn by the female victims

572
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,600
are indeed quite valuable.

573
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,320
The list didn't show

574
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,480
any musicians.

575
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,800
But there are a few familiar names.

576
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
They are male victims.

577
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,840
That's correct.

578
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,480
In their quest to amuse fair maidens,

579
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
they squandered their fortune with ease.

580
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,000
This seems like a messy account.

581
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,840
Many transactions are only noted as

582
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,000
banquet gifts.

583
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,560
No quantities or specific recipients.

584
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,920
These shops often holds banquets,

585
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,520
inviting the noble ladies of the city.

586
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,200
They must have been given as gifts.

587
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,760
Such a grand gesture!

588
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,760
That Ms. Yang

589
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
is indeed impressive.

590
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,680
Definitely someone else

591
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,800
is behind all this.

592
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,920
Ms. Yang

593
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,280
is a trusted confidant of Princess Ying.

594
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,360
Her status are

595
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,200
beyond those of ordinary palace maids.

596
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,800
Yet earlier, in your presence,

597
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,520
she referred to herself as a mere servant,

598
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,920
and willingly handed over

599
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,880
this list.

600
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,080
She seems

601
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
to be quite concerned about

602
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,400
offending someone of your stature.

603
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,160
Mask her strength to deceive the enemy.

604
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,200
She wanna prevent you from

605
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,480
continuing your investigation.

606
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,600
It is highly likely that

607
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
Princess Ying is behind it.

608
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,040
Maybe they intend to use banquets

609
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,600
to win over various officials

610
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
and their ladies,

611
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
then through their lovers to gain

612
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,280
insight into the movements

613
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,360
of each household?

614
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,800
No wonder Lord Zhang

615
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,160
is so cautious around her.

616
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,800
Are you familiar with Princess Ying?

617
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
She's highly

618
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,920
favored.

619
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,240
She appears to indulge in pleasure daily,

620
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,960
but in reality, she is quite astute.

621
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
Don't worry.

622
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,600
She will likely

623
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,720
seek you out soon.

624
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,960
What do you mean?

625
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,880
My Lord.

626
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,760
Enter.

627
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,000
Princess Ying...

628
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,440
Princess Ying invited

629
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,280
Her Lady to the banquet.

630
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,880
Isn't that Lord Commander's wife?

631
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,520
No one is doing her hair or something?

632
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,480
I just noticed

633
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,960
Lady Wu looks unwell.

634
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,640
I heard that her husband

635
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,560
is keeping a musician as mistress.

636
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,880
She was so foolish back then,

637
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,880
insisting on marrying that minor

638
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
official from the Ministry of Justice.

639
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,200
Men...

640
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,600
whether they have power or not,

641
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,120
rich or poor,

642
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,480
they're all the same.

643
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,720
Exactly.

644
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,200
I also heard that

645
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
Lady Tang

646
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,280
was fond of a poor commoner,

647
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,080
and they were quite close.

648
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,880
In the end,

649
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,800
that man eloped with a musician.

650
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
I've never heard of this.

651
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,920
Do you know why Lady Tang

652
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
has a good relationship with

653
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,960
Princess Ying?

654
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,920
Why is that?

655
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,640
Because

656
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,560
they are both into poor boys.

657
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,480
Isn't that right?

658
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,440
Exactly.

659
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,680
Look.

660
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Apologies!

661
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,880
It's alright.

662
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,320
I was the one being careless.

663
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,480
Gratitude!

664
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,440
Look.

665
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,000
How gracious

666
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Mrs Shen is!

667
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,280
Isn't she a concubine's daughter?

668
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,880
Look at her now,

669
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,880
pretending to be a refined young lady.

670
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,880
Mrs Shen, it's your first time

671
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,000
attending such a banquet.

672
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,360
You might not be accustomed to it.

673
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Actually, it's not usually like this.

674
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,080
It's just that Lady Liu's

675
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,840
husband was interrogated in IG

676
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,560
just a few months ago.

677
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,840
It's fine.

678
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,160
This is the way of things, right?

679
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,120
When the husband offends someone,

680
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,640
it's the wife who suffers the consequences.

681
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,880
So,

682
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
just forget it.

683
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,680
They're just

684
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,080
venting their frustrations.

685
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,800
Your dress

686
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,680
is all wet.

687
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,600
Please

688
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,560
come with me

689
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,840
to get changed.

690
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,160
Let's go.

691
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,840
This place is called the Medicinal Pool.

692
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,400
Soaking in here

693
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,960
can promote health and heal injuries.

694
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,080
You're all wet and you might catch a cold.

695
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,800
You should go inside.

696
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,080
Take some time to enjoy yourself.

697
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
This is far too precious.

698
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
I really...

699
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,360
I'm currently fine-tuning

700
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,640
the new formula for the medicinal spring.

701
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,240
You could

702
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,760
help me assess

703
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,680
the effectiveness of this new formula.

704
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,400
You even know how to prepare medicine?

705
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,080
I only have a basic understanding.

706
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,320
Right.

707
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
This is the scent of Bainao incense.

708
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,960
She was the one peeking

709
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
at the gate of Ximing Temple that day.

710
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
This is a fire moth.

711
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,680
I've heard a legend about it.

712
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,160
Someone saw a fire moth

713
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,400
and followed it up the mountain.

714
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,480
Afterward,

715
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,280
he actually gained immortality.

716
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Lady Tang,

717
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,280
with your temperament and status,

718
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,880
do you also yearn for eternal life?

719
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,240
Life is just a few short decades.

720
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
If

721
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,480
there are things you want to achieve,

722
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,719
don't hesitate at all.

723
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,400
Once youth has passed,

724
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,080
it would be

725
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,759
too late to

726
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,920
pursue your dreams.

727
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,560
You're absolutely right.

728
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,000
Come on.

729
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,640
You are quite astute,

730
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,520
and share a deep bond with Lord Shen.

731
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Regarding the serial murders in the city,

732
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,279
it's truly comforting to

733
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,000
have both of you on the case.

734
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,840
You know, the Liangs

735
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,279
have certainly endured many trials.

736
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,239
My interactions with Lady Liang

737
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,520
have been frequent.

738
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,160
It's truly a pity for such a beauty.

739
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,200
Her husband doesn't even spare her a glance.

740
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
And now,

741
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,920
she has lost her son.

742
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
She's at odds with her husband?

743
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,640
Apologies for my loose tongue.

744
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,400
It's their privacy,

745
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
and it shouldn't be shared.

746
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,080
Please,

747
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,360
don't take it to heart.

748
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
Please convey to Lady Liang

749
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,920
that the murderer will be caught soon.

750
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,560
No matter how deeply they hide.

751
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,880
Mrs Shen,

752
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,560
Princess Ying is calling

753
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,200
you to discuss matters after your bath.

754
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,440
Got it.

755
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,760
I've been waiting for four hours.

756
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,920
Why isn't she here yet?

757
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,160
Greetings.

758
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,520
The flowers are blooming beautifully.

759
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,040
I completely forgot about you.

760
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,640
Take it easy.

761
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,640
I called you here today just for a

762
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,480
casual chat, with no ulterior motives.

763
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,880
Well,

764
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,920
investigation is a sure thing.

765
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,080
But certain matters

766
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,040
should be left untouched.

767
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,960
You're a perceptive girl.

768
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,680
Is my intention clear to you?

769
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,960
Choose your battles wisely.

770
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,440
Has your husband not taught you this?

771
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,120
Your Highness.

772
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,080
Mr Shen has arrived

773
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,320
for his wife.

774
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,600
It's only been half a day.

775
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,800
He seems

776
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,920
to be quite concerned about you.

777
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,440
It appears the rumors circulating

778
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,760
are not without truth.

779
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,800
The bond between you two

780
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
is truly enviable.

781
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,120
Let him in.

782
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,200
Your Highness.

783
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,320
The flower banquet has concluded.

784
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,920
Yet my wife hasn't returned home.

785
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,360
She must have lost her way in the palace.

786
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,320
I was worried,

787
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,600
so I came to find her.

788
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,240
After all, there are

789
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,640
many household chores

790
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,840
that require her attention.

791
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,040
You're here personally to find her.

792
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,800
If I kept holding onto her,

793
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,280
that would be quite inconsiderate of me.

794
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,160
However, there's one thing

795
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
I have to say.

796
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,560
Solving the case is of utmost importance.

797
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,560
Thank you for the reminder.

798
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,400
Are you injured?

799
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,240
I'm bleeding, really?

800
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,280
Did Princess Ying force you

801
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,160
to consume anything?

802
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,960
Have you been poisoned?

803
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,160
Well, you've come a long way to get me.

804
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,120
Once we're in the carriage,

805
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,560
no one will see us.

806
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,080
Er...

807
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,560
Did you foresee that my trip to the palace

808
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,960
would be fraught with danger?

809
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,400
For someone who just learned to walk,

810
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
if she never fell,

811
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,800
how would she understand the pain?

812
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,520
Moreover, you've uncovered

813
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,080
a trump card of the princess.

814
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,400
That's why she gave you a good shake.

815
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,120
It was us who revealed her secrets,

816
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,760
yet I'm the only one being targeted.

817
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,560
However,

818
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,720
your rescue...

819
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,760
No need for thanks.

820
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,080
You wrote a memo to save me before,

821
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,320
so consider this a mutual exchange.

822
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,840
During your earlier investigation,

823
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,600
did you discover the discord between

824
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,360
the main couple of the Liangs?

825
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,760
What's the point of investigating

826
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,400
their private matters?

827
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,840
The primary wife has indeed been

828
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,120
fixated on the concubine's son.

829
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,120
She cries and causes scenes daily.

830
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,480
Fortunately, Liang Jiren

831
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,760
is somewhat reasonable, and hasn't

832
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,280
made things difficult for his concubine.

833
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,640
Liang Chenzhong is the only son.

834
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
The primary wife has been effectively

835
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,560
deprived of her descendants by the killer.

836
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,960
Many people harbor hatred for him.

837
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,280
Even if he hadn't been disemboweled,

838
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,640
he wouldn't have lived long.

839
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,560
The one who poisoned him

840
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,080
also had murderous intent.

841
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,720
It's just that he was

842
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,600
simply not as fast as the serial killer.
