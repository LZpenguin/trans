Melody of Golden Age EP21

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,640
Harder!

4
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,600
Isn't that Mr. Han?

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,360
Halt.

6
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Your Highness!

7
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,840
This jerk has no shame at all.

8
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,120
He had the audacity to approach

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,240
the gate of Princess Ying's residence.

10
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,840
He needs to be taught a lesson today.

11
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,080
What brings you here?

12
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,920
Your Highness!

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
I beg you to save Caiwei.

14
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
Han Shiyuan,

15
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
I have given you chances before.

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,840
You didn't cherish it yourself.

17
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
Now,

18
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,320
what do you have to offer me in return?

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,920
Your Highness!

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Your Highness!

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
As long as you are willing to save her,

22
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Shiyuan's life

23
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,800
will belong to you.

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,160
From now on,

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
no matter what you ask me to do,

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
Shiyuan will never refuse.

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
Dare you still trouble Her Highness!

28
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,840
Enough!

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
You're the epitome of a true romantic,

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,680
putting your life on the line for her.

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
What a shame.

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,760
The poison in Yan Caiwei

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,240
was not administered by me.

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,840
I don't know how to save her either.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,160
You wish to follow her in life and death,

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
then die elsewhere together

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,000
and spare my eyes.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,840
Ms. Yang.

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
Throw him back to the Yan residence.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
Don't let him die here.

41
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,560
Understood.

42
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
Your Highness.

43
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,520
Your Highness, Your Highness!

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
Prince Xian.

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,600
Yan Kuo is timid and

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,880
unfit for greater responsibilities,

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,600
while his daughters

48
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,360
are all quite capable.

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,440
However, with Yan Caiwei poisoned,

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
It's unclear if it was Princess Ying

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,200
or the work of Chen Huo'e.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,120
If Yan Caiwei

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,240
were to die from this poison,

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
Princess Ying and Chen Huo'e

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,240
would be inextricably linked.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,960
In fact,

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,560
it doesn't even matter whether it was her

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,600
Shen Du will certainly side with us

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,760
for the sake of his sister-in-law.

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,760
Even if Shen Du remains foolish

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
and doesn't align with us,

62
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,440
Princess Ying

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,400
wouldn't dare to trust him any longer.

64
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,440
Sir,

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
what have you been

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,520
hiding from me

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,600
all these years?

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,720
Your Highness.

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
your benevolence is well-known,

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,080
but great deeds require overlooking trifles.

71
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,800
A true leader is not soft when necessary.

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
You were born into the royal family,

73
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,240
and thus cannot escape

74
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,760
the intricacies of power and human nature.

75
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,880
Even the Her Majesty

76
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
had to navigate carefully in her time

77
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,000
to secure her position.

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
The late Crown Prince's death remain murky,

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,160
- and now the young emperor... - Insolent!

80
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,760
I may have spoken out of turn,

81
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,120
but I assure you,

82
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,840
my loyalty to Prince Xian

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,520
is as steadfast as the sun in the sky.

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,680
Sir,

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,440
over the years, you have

86
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,760
protected me with unwavering dedication,

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
and every action you've taken

88
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,400
has been to pave the way for my future.

89
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,880
I am fully aware of that.

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,120
However, I truly do not wish

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,400
to witness family members

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
turning against one another.

93
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,120
If it must come to that,

94
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
then I would rather forgo the regency.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Prince Xian,

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,280
you must not entertain

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,040
such thoughts!

98
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,960
You are the current Prince Xian.

99
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,160
In the future,

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
you'll undoubtedly rise to the position of

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
regent of our empire!

102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,800
Everything I have done

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,640
has been in your best interests!

104
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,280
Your Highness!

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,920
Foolish!

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,920
Foolish!

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Sir,

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
does the pursuit of power

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,120
truly warrant such an obsession?

110
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,680
Lord Shen!

111
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
Are you concerned about

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
my lady's?

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,760
Nonsense!

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,400
My Lord!

115
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,440
My remark was truly foolish.

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,520
However,

117
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
I seem to know

118
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,040
what my lady

119
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,840
was preoccupied with

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,000
all night at the Ministry of Justice.

121
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,880
Yesterday, Yan Mojie came to see me.

122
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,960
He asked me

123
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,760
to help him look through

124
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,800
the files at the headquarters.

125
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,600
I heard that Yan Caiwei

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,560
has been severely poisoned,

127
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
and it seems to be

128
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,000
Fire Moth Sect's infamous poison of

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,360
"co"

130
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,080
"coco"

131
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,720
"cocoon"

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,240
"cocoon poison"

133
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
Cocoon poison?

134
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,480
Yes.

135
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,520
The entire Yan residence

136
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,320
has been in chaos these past few days

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,720
because of this.

138
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,320
The Yan residence is in chaos?

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,120
How come I haven't heard a word?

140
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,560
Perhaps my lady didn't want to bother you?

141
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
Even Yan Mojie knows to seek your help

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,520
when something goes wrong.

143
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,080
How could she not know who to turn to?

144
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,960
Then my lady must have

145
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,080
her own connections.

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,840
I have heard that

147
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,720
my lady went to the palace today

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
to consult a healer.

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
It is said that

150
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
she even presented a recipe for an

151
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,880
antidote from the Imperial Inspectorate.

152
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Rumor has it that

153
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,160
this was based on Chen Huo'e's

154
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,480
testimony during interrogation.

155
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
Imperial Inspectorate?

156
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,600
Chen Huo'e?

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,440
I have already inquired with

158
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,280
that healer.

159
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,240
He indicated that the antidote

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,800
is about eighty percent authentic,

161
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
but

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,320
there is a super rare

163
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,840
ingredient in it.

164
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,120
What ingredient?

165
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
It's a doppelganger's

166
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
blood

167
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
blood of

168
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,840
blood of heart.

169
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Anyone here?

170
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:44,880
Are there no

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
living human beings in the Lai residence?

172
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
Lord Shen,

173
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
what kind of trickery

174
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,520
is Lai Luozhi trying to pull?

175
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
If you know it's a trick,

176
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
why be anxious?

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,240
You all stay put.

178
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
I'll go check in the back.

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,000
Lord Shen!

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,720
Ease your mind.

181
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,120
Chancellor Lai,

182
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,400
You've orchestrated such a show

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,360
just to lure me here.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,800
What?

185
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm already here.

186
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440
Yet you're hiding and avoiding me.

187
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
This is not in line with

188
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,040
your usual style of

189
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,960
assertive presence.

190
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,560
I apologize for intruding upon a lady,

191
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,920
I was indeed rude.

192
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,080
This is your first visit to my residence,

193
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,720
and you're already chasing after a lady.

194
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
If this were to spread,

195
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
it would surely become a laughingstock.

196
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Chancellor Lai,

197
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,760
enough with these

198
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,960
intimidating theatrics.

199
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,640
These flashy little tricks are

200
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,200
hardly worthy of The White Death's attention.

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,640
However, Lord Shen,

202
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,360
you've intruded into my residence,

203
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,400
so you owe me an explanation.

204
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,640
If I didn't come,

205
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,520
would you offer me the heart's blood

206
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,400
of a doppelganger?

207
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,520
What do you mean by that?

208
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
You intentionally poisoned Yan Caiwei

209
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,960
and had Yan Xing obtain the recipe,

210
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,520
which obviously implies you

211
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,360
possess the heart's blood of Chen Huo'e.

212
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,880
And you use it as a bait.

213
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,800
Lord Shen,

214
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,200
that was merely your conjecture.

215
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,960
I do not acknowledge a word of it.

216
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
However...

217
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,320
I happen to have

218
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,040
a vial of the heart's blood

219
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,880
of a doppelganger.

220
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,640
Lord Shen,

221
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,400
don't!

222
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,840
What's the matter?

223
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,960
Do you think my water is tainted,

224
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,760
or are you worried it might be poisonous?

225
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
I have always held you in high regard,

226
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,960
Lord Shen.

227
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,360
You've made quite the entrance,

228
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,880
storming into my residence.

229
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,760
If you can't make it out today,

230
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,760
or if you leave and

231
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,000
soon suffer from poisoning,

232
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,960
I would indeed have a hard time

233
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,080
explaining this to Her Majesty.

234
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,040
Where's the blood of the doppelganger?

235
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,880
It's right in your teacup.

236
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,240
You tricked him into drinking it?

237
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,240
You sealed the heart's blood of the

238
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
doppelganger in this teacup?

239
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,360
I specifically sought out

240
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,440
skilled craftsmen from Xichen

241
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,160
to create this

242
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
teacup for the heart's blood.

243
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,600
In fact,

244
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,640
the ingredient you're looking for

245
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,440
has always been right in front of you.

246
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,880
Yet you treat my residence

247
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,040
like a den of snakes and scorpions,

248
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,680
not even daring to drink a cup of tea.

249
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,360
Actually,

250
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,600
I am not someone

251
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
who is untrustworthy.

252
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,320
Isn't that so?

253
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,640
In this world,

254
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,400
the heart's blood of a doppelganger

255
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,480
is exceedingly rare.

256
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,080
This cup is a true work of art,

257
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,200
and it surely won't come without a price.

258
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,520
Chancellor Lai has orchestrated

259
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,200
such an elaborate scheme to draw me here.

260
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,160
What is it that you seek?

261
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,600
Speak plainly.

262
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,960
It's a relief to talk

263
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,640
to someone intelligent.

264
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,040
In truth,

265
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,160
I have no specific demands,

266
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,520
except that you, Lord Shen,

267
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,080
remember this favor of mine.

268
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,960
In the future,

269
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,160
you will surely repay it in double.

270
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,040
Then there's no other way,

271
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,760
but to see if you

272
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,640
truly love your wife.

273
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
To see if you are willing to

274
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,360
make an uncertain promise

275
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,280
to save your sister-in-law.

276
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
I have

277
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,880
taken up the offer.

278
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,720
Lord Shen,

279
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,960
I won't see you off.

280
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,960
I truly don't get it.

281
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
You planned this scheme meticulously,

282
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,400
first with the poisoning,

283
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,360
then providing the antidote,

284
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,400
asking me to show my face in front of him.

285
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,920
What exactly are you plotting?

286
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
You don't need to understand.

287
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,440
I don't need to understand?

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,320
Our entire family has sacrificed so much

289
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,680
for your so-called grand ambitions.

290
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,600
Haven't we given enough?

291
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,920
Now,

292
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,440
I don't even have the right

293
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
to ask a question?

294
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,280
It's my fault,

295
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
sister.

296
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,959
I was just anxious.

297
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,040
How could I not understand your suffering?

298
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,439
Everything I do

299
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,600
is to ensure that

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,920
all our sacrifices

301
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,560
will be rewarded appropriately.

302
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,560
Poisoning Yan Caiwei

303
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,280
can draw the attention of Prince Xian,

304
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:47,520
Princess Ying and the Imperial Guard,

305
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,000
creating suspicion among these parties.

306
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,200
This goal has already been achieved.

307
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
As for Shen Du,

308
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,080
he is indeed the hardest to deal with.

309
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,840
The Imperial Guard and Shen residence

310
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,560
are heavily guarded.

311
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,280
The spies inserted in

312
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,080
have all been removed.

313
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,640
Is Shen Du on Prince Xian's side?

314
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,680
No.

315
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,160
Shen Du has always

316
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,240
maintained neutrality.

317
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,440
He neither supports Prince Xian,

318
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
nor favors Princess Ying,

319
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,040
and he keeps his distance from me.

320
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,200
The more cautious he is

321
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,360
in maintaining balance,

322
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
the more the Her Majesty

323
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,440
trusts him,

324
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,440
which is increasingly unfavorable

325
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,160
for what we intend to do.

326
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,360
Then why not just kill him?

327
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,360
Or directly make demands of him?

328
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,960
Unknown promises are the most terrifying.

329
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to instill in him

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,160
a sense of unease,

331
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,880
a sense of fear,

332
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,920
and a hesitation filled with doubt.

333
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,880
Once fear takes

334
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,240
root in his heart,

335
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,960
one day,

336
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,600
it will be more useful

337
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,160
than death itself.

338
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,200
Xing!

339
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,960
Xing!

340
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,280
All the ingredients are ready.

341
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
We're just missing one,

342
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,040
the heart's blood of a doppelganger.

343
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,960
But over at Lord Zhang,

344
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,480
your father hit a snag.

345
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,720
As for Princess Ying,

346
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
Shiyuan got beaten.

347
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,800
I'm at my wit's end.

348
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,640
I beg you,

349
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,200
please think of another way!

350
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,160
- My Lady! - My Lady.

351
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
My lady, what are you doing?

352
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,560
Aren't you just pushing her?

353
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,280
She's already been trying to find a way,

354
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,520
and she's exhausted.

355
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,200
What more can she think of?

356
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,840
What about...

357
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,840
What about Lord Shen.

358
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,040
Silence!

359
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,960
Why should I?

360
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,160
Chen Huo'e

361
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,840
was killed by The White Death,

362
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,840
and the retribution has fallen on my girl.

363
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,360
Why shouldn't I

364
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,640
ask The White Death for help,

365
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,360
and let him figure something out?

366
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,120
Even if Caiwei once wronged him,

367
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
no matter what,

368
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
she is still his sister-in-law now!

369
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,720
- My lady! - What you said makes sense!

370
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,360
I'm late.

371
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
- Lord Shen! - No formalities.

372
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,160
Here is the missing ingredient,

373
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,640
the heart's blood of a doppelganger.

374
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,920
It's contained right in this teacup.

375
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,960
We're grateful to you for saving her life!

376
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,680
Please, rise.

377
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,040
Xing and I are one.

378
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,680
The affairs of the Yan residence

379
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,600
are also my responsibility.

380
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,240
This can't wait any longer.

381
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,200
Gratitude, Lord Shen!

382
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,040
I will take it to prepare the antidote.

383
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,000
Gratitude, Lord Shen!

384
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
Hurry, hurry!

385
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,120
Caiwei is saved!

386
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,600
Caiwei is saved!

387
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,560
Come on, come on!

388
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,840
Xing,

389
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,000
when will I finally be

390
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,960
your first choice

391
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,880
when you need help?

392
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,440
Xing!

393
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,320
It's alright now.

394
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,800
Can we really trust

395
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,200
Lai Luozhi's words?

396
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,000
Is the heart's blood he provided

397
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,600
reliable?

398
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,840
You can't fully trust

399
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,000
anyone's words.

400
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,760
Shen Du,

401
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,440
I have something important to tell you.

402
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,600
If I don't tell you now,

403
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,280
I might miss my chance in the future.

404
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,680
Do you know

405
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,800
what Lord Zhang's intention was

406
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,840
by insisting on marrying a girl

407
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,880
from the Yan Family to you?

408
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Lord Zhang coerced my father,

409
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,720
arranging this marriage.

410
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,880
Originally, Caiwei was to marry you,

411
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,400
but I took her place.

412
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,240
Lord Zhang still expects me

413
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,880
to be his and the Prince Xian's eyes

414
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,200
within Shen residence.

415
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,640
But I've never truly assisted

416
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,840
Prince Xian's faction to harm you.

417
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,800
I know.

418
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
I believe you wouldn't harm me.

419
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,440
You know?

420
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,280
You really trust me?

421
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,240
Xing,

422
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
since you have never done anything

423
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,880
to harm me,

424
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,240
there's no need to feel guilty.

425
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,080
In the future, if you have

426
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,480
any doubts,

427
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,720
just come and ask me,

428
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,240
alright?

429
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,600
What are you doing?

430
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,200
Spit it out!

431
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Spit it!

432
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,360
Come on!

433
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,760
Spit it out!

434
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,280
Hurry!

435
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,600
If you can test the antidote for your sister,

436
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,680
I can certainly do the same for you.

437
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,240
Who asked you to do that?

438
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,920
You...

439
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,240
I will use my internal energy

440
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
to spread the effect throughout my system.

441
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,800
If I remain unharmed

442
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,960
after a short while, your sister

443
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
can take the antidote with peace of mind.

444
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,400
Why were you being so foolish?

445
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,280
Testing the antidote for my sister

446
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
is a duty of blood relatives.

447
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,320
What's with you?

448
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,240
Do you feel any discomfort?

449
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,320
Your wounds have just healed.

450
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,360
How can you take such a risk?

451
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,040
After taking it,

452
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,280
do you feel any discomfort?

453
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Anything?

454
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,560
Are you feeling unwell at all?

455
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,080
Say something!

456
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm really fine.

457
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,880
Since Lai Luozhi was

458
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,160
trying to draw me in,

459
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,280
the item he offered should be authentic.

460
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,960
However, he clearly didn't foresee

461
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,040
that I would personally take the antidote.

462
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,960
Otherwise,

463
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,120
he might have actually included

464
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,480
something deadly in it.

465
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,920
Ouch!

466
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,760
It hurts!

467
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
Let me take a look.

468
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,640
I wasn't poisoned to death,

469
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,000
but I might just get beaten to death.

470
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,040
The antidote is fine.

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,840
Hurry and take it to your sister.

472
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,560
Hurry.

473
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,320
Here it comes, the antidote is here!

474
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,960
Hurry up, hurry up!

475
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,520
Don't worry,

476
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,600
she will regain consciousness soon.

477
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,520
It's already been two hours.

478
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Mother...

479
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,960
Caiwei,

480
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,960
you're awake!

481
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,000
Mother...

482
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,720
Caiwei!

483
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,000
Caiwei, you're awake!

484
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,560
Xing...

485
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,240
Father...

486
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,400
Where is my love?

487
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Caiwei!

488
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,200
My love!

489
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,120
What happened to you?

490
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,920
Father!

491
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,120
Father!

492
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,880
Princess Ying sent a gift box,

493
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
along with a note.

494
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,160
Princess Ying?

495
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,000
Read it!

496
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,080
I have heard that Mr. Han and Yan Caiwei

497
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
share a deep bond,

498
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,480
In life and death, they vow never to part.

499
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,640
This love, so fervent, so bright and pure.

500
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,000
The radiance of their affection,

501
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,280
akin to the blooms of the crabapple,

502
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,680
Moved by their devotion,

503
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,560
I too wish to see their love fulfilled,

504
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
For such passion should

505
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,720
not be denied by fate.

506
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,640
I bestow upon them a jade ornament,

507
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,560
May their love last, forever in harmony.

508
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,160
It seems that

509
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Princess Ying

510
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,120
intends to

511
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,560
let Mr. Han go

512
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,640
and fulfill your happiness.

513
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,320
Xing,

514
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,560
are you feeling unwell?

515
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,200
No, not at all.

516
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,360
Why did Lai Luozhi do all these?

517
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,360
Poisoning and then supplying the antidote,

518
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,800
going in circles.

519
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,880
What is his purpose?

520
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,560
His target

521
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,920
may not be your sister,

522
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,520
but me.

523
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
He wants to set a trap

524
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,400
to hold something over you,

525
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,480
to grant you a favor.

526
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,520
Have you been threatened by him?

527
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,560
Or have you promised him anything?

528
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't worry,

529
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,000
nothing happened.

530
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,560
Instead, it's your sister who has been

531
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,880
suffering this undeserved misfortune.

532
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,240
So,

533
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,280
pursuing justice with all your heart

534
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,840
and seeking the truth

535
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,800
can indeed bring unforeseen risks

536
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,320
to your loved ones.

537
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,320
However,

538
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,480
the path we choose

539
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,600
is destined to be

540
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,000
a thorny road, isn't it?

541
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,160
Since I have made this choice,

542
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
I will not regret it.

543
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,520
I must stay true to my heart

544
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,840
and do everything I can

545
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,160
to protect those around me.

546
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,560
Xing,

547
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,520
from now on, focus on

548
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,680
what you believe is right.

549
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,320
I will protect you

550
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,880
and ensure your family remains safe.

551
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,040
Shen Du...

552
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,520
Lord Shen!

553
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,640
What is it?

554
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Are you sending my lady back

555
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,720
or heading to the Imperial Guard?

556
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,960
To the Shen residence.

557
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,920
Understood!

558
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,440
Earlier,

559
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,600
what did you want to ask me?

560
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,760
Nothing...

561
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,560
Nothing at all.

562
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,680
Shen Du.

563
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
You protect me,

564
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,720
help me,

565
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,160
support me...

566
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,760
Then in your heart

567
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,560
what am I

568
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,080
to you?

569
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,920
You...

570
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,360
You should get some rest.

571
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,520
I'll study for a bit.

572
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,680
Study?

573
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,360
The examination is coming up.

574
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,440
I made a commitment

575
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
in front of Her Majesty

576
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,520
and Lady Xu.

577
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,720
I'll take part in the exam as a scribe.

578
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,680
If I fail,

579
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,720
I won't even be able to

580
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,800
remain as a clerk.

581
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,960
Now that Caiwei's poison has been cured

582
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
and the Chen Huo'e case is resolved,

583
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,720
if I don't burn the midnight oil now,

584
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,800
I might fail the examination.

585
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,240
So tonight,

586
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,080
you've been in and out,

587
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,200
moving stuff around,

588
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,080
just to use my lighting to study?

589
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,520
Exactly!

590
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,120
You happen to like the light, right?

591
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,520
We could save the oil for several lamps!

592
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,880
Then I wish you

593
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:42,160
success in your examination

594
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,200
and may your wish come true.

595
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,279
Thank you for your kind words!

596
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,200
It's rare for you to take the initiative.

597
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,640
Is there some good news?

598
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,400
Well,

599
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
thank you.

600
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
Caiwei's poison has been cured.

601
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,240
Your recipe really worked.

602
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,440
Of course.

603
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,120
How could my recipe be fake?

604
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,760
I...

605
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,120
Have I ever deceived you?

606
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,440
You clearly...

607
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,040
Alright,

608
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,880
it's true that I've been

609
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,160
calling you "maskman" on my own.

610
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,800
I wouldn't say you've deceived me.

611
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,000
Anyway...

612
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,080
Anyway,

613
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,480
thank you.

614
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,240
Thank me?

615
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,840
A mere oral gratitude

616
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,320
might not be enough.

617
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,600
What do you want then?

618
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,480
You shouldn't be asking me this.

619
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,520
You should think carefully about

620
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,760
how you plan to show your gratitude.

621
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,680
Lu Chuichui?

622
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,400
Lu Chuichui!

623
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,040
I'm here.

624
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,360
Chui?

625
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,960
Chui!

626
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,000
Chui,

627
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,040
what's wrong?

628
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,240
Poker face...

629
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,720
I...

630
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,400
He...

631
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
I thought...

632
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,600
I thought...

633
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,800
What happened?

634
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,400
It's nothing.

635
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,040
My feet are numb.

636
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,000
Your feet are numb?

637
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,000
You really scared me!

638
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,360
I thought

639
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,680
something bad had happened!

640
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,640
Poker face, poker face...

641
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,160
Can you take me home?

642
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,800
Come on, slowly.

643
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,680
What are you doing?

644
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,240
Didn't you say your feet are numb?

645
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,440
I'll carry you.

646
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,680
Poker face,

647
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,160
tell me,

648
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
if there's someone

649
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,840
who is usually extremely wicked,

650
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,000
hated by everyone,

651
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,560
but occasionally shows kindness

652
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,200
and genuinely helps others,

653
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,440
is he a good person?

654
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Is he worth being friends with?

655
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,920
This is up to you.

656
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
You should ask yourself,

657
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,320
not others.

658
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,840
If

659
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,760
you believe that person is a friend

660
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,320
and that he is a good person,

661
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,280
and he also won't harm you,

662
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,480
Then he's surely worth befriending.

663
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,400
I should ask myself,

664
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
not others?

665
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,320
Chi,

666
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,560
by the time you receive this letter,

667
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,280
I will likely be participating

668
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,840
in the examination for female officials.

669
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,040
In this examination,

670
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,960
I have truly burned my bridges,

671
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,920
staking my future as a female official.

672
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,120
But I believe

673
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,960
I won't let down Her Majesty

674
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,600
or Lady Xu's trust in me.

675
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,200
I'll also honor

676
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,960
the help he has given me.

677
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,000
Oh my, Xing girl,

678
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
you are first place!

679
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,440
My Xing is the top scorer!

680
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
Oh my, that's fantastic, Xing!

681
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,560
You'll finally be promoted to scribe!

682
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,160
I'm about to have

683
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,960
an rank-eight friend looking out for me!

684
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,840
What about you?

685
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,880
Me?

686
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,640
Never mind about me.

687
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,560
Anyway, I already have

688
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,600
an rank-eight bestie.

689
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,880
I don't care if I fail!

690
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,400
- So happy. - Chui!

691
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,760
Chui!

692
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,840
You made the list!

693
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,360
You finally made the list!

694
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,480
This time,

695
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,880
I didn't spend any money

696
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,840
on tutors.

697
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,160
You made it entirely on your own merit!

698
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Though it's the last place,

699
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,720
I am still proud of you!

700
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,320
My precious daughter!

701
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,600
Lord Shen,

702
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,960
my lady will be promoted to a scribe.

703
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,720
She will out rank even me.

704
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,840
Do you have issues with it?

705
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,960
Not at all!

706
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,080
I'm truly happy for my lady!

707
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,480
Let's go.

708
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,200
Father,

709
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,360
the order doesn't mention the Yans at all!

710
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
Did you check it thoroughly?

711
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,600
I've gone through it line by line,

712
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,200
and it doesn't mention us!

713
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,720
The order personally signed by Lord Zhang,

714
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,520
among the officials assigned for border duty,

715
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,720
doesn't mention the Yan Family!

716
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,960
That's fantastic!

717
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,480
Thank goodness, thank goodness!

718
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,280
Our Yan family has finally escaped this.

719
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,880
We've avoided a catastrophe!

720
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,040
Xing,

721
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,600
today our Yan Family is truly

722
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,040
blessed with two auspicious events!

723
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,680
Two fortunate events!

724
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,000
Let's treat ourselves to something nice.

725
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,640
Absolutely!

726
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,960
Good, good.

727
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,040
Mother!
