00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:14,960
English subtitles are available

00:01:48,080 --> 00:02:01,760
Melody of Golden Age EP06

3
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,440
A girl

4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,720
shouldn't always expect

5
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,440
others to lend a hand.

6
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,480
When one is capable,

7
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,040
it's better to rely on oneself.

8
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
He is a servant of the Yan family!

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
My lady,

10
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
the lord asked me to remind you

11
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
that three days have already passed.

12
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,280
The day for you to return home

13
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,360
has been postponed repeatedly.

14
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,840
You mentioned you would return tomorrow,

15
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,920
please keep your promise.

16
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,920
Alright.

17
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,880
Got it.

18
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Xing,

19
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,200
everyone in Xiang'an has been talking that

20
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,760
Commander Yan is deeply in love with you.

21
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,600
It brings great pride

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
to me.

23
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,160
So beautiful.

24
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
It looks good.

25
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,920
It's good, huh?

26
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,160
It looks good.

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,400
Truly beautiful.

28
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Xing,

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360
you've finally returned.

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,560
Why have you

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,440
been gone so long?

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,000
Where is your husband?

33
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,840
He...

34
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,200
has urgent matters at Imperial Guard.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,160
The case is pressing.

36
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,880
Is it more important than

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,400
you returning home?

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
No lady returns home alone after a wedding

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
throughout the entire empire.

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,560
He'll be here once he wraps up his work.

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,320
Isn't that right?

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Yijiao

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,560
what brings you back today?

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,240
You didn't come back just

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,360
to see me return home, did you?

46
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Your brother-in-law ordered a bracelet

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
for me, and it was delivered here.

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,720
I thought I'd stop by to see you.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,360
What about you all?

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
Take a look at this bracelet.

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,640
Isn't it stunning?

52
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,320
I fell in love with it the moment I saw it.

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,480
No matter what unkind remarks she makes,

54
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,120
just ignore her.

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,160
What's so special about it anyway?

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,400
What a show off!

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,560
Why isn't your husband here?

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Well,

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
your brother-in-law asked her

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,080
to bring a variety of snacks and fruits.

61
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
Everyone, please help yourselves.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,880
Here, dear husband.

63
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,720
My lord,

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,000
Xing

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
lives a miserable life.

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,480
The others marry well and live happily,

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,520
but my Xing

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,240
had to save someone else's skin.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Hey,

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
where did that come from?

71
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,760
So you were saying it's

72
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,720
all my fault?

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,240
Look at me,

74
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm only good at

75
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
making myself look pretty.

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,200
I don't lift a finger around the house.

77
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
My husband still calls me his lucky charm.

78
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,840
I had always hoped to have a daughter,

79
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,920
someone who'd be a little sweetheart.

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,440
But who would have thought,

81
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,480
I ended up with a pair of twins!

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,400
Mom, you wouldn't believe

83
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,080
how mischievous the little ones are.

84
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,760
Xing, you really

85
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
should spend more time with Yijiao.

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,680
So you could partake in her good fortune.

87
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,640
Don't just bury yourself in official duties.

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,560
Settle down now that you're married.

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,360
Exactly!

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,880
My sweet little sister,

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
you should quit

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,960
the clerk job.

93
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,200
Listen to me,

94
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
as a woman,

95
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,120
what's the best way to

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,040
change your fate?

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,440
It's to manage the household well.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
My dear brother,

99
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I heard from my colleagues

100
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
that last time when

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
they were patrolling the stew streets,

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,600
they saw you partaking in courtesan entertainment.

103
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,800
You were even chasing after the girls,

104
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,200
running all over the place.

105
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
That's a lie!

106
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,560
You have the nerve to criticize me.

107
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,480
The most disappointing one in the family

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,200
is you!

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,960
Look how sharp-tongued you are.

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,480
Tell me,

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,760
where's your femininity?

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,440
I am sharp-tongued, huh?

113
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,160
If I were your husband,

114
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,200
I'd be visiting the stew streets every day

115
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,240
and wouldn't want to see you at all.

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,160
Say that again? I dare you!

117
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,920
That's enough!

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Commander Yan has arrived!

119
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,040
Welcome, Commander!

120
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,480
I do believe

121
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,760
my wife is wonderful.

122
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,960
Apologies, I was caught up with work.

123
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law,

124
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
please forgive me.

125
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Well, well,

126
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,560
The timing is just perfect.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,960
Yes, indeed.

128
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,160
Today, as Xing returns home, I'd like to

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,480
express my heartfelt gratitude to the Yans

130
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
for raising such a remarkable daughter.

131
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,080
It's truly a blessing

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,120
to have such a wise and exceptional girl.

133
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,760
Bring them in.

134
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,440
Lord Yan,

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,520
Xing told me

136
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,879
that you have a passion for tea.

137
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
These are glazed sunflower-patterned cups,

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,320
from the Yue kiln.

139
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,960
This is the imperial gift of zisun tea.

140
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,120
It's far too precious!

141
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm truly humbled!

142
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
I was incredibly fortunate to marry Xing.

143
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,440
Even Princess Ying remarked

144
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,600
that I married an exceptional wife.

145
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,560
Her Highness, Princess Ying?

146
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,600
Pan Yanzhi?

147
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,280
Hasn't his calligraphy

148
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,840
already become extinct?

149
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,440
It's a copy.

150
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
A few years back, I happened

151
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
to come across a rubbing of his work.

152
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,800
On a whim, I decided to study it.

153
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,240
Even you find it look authentic,

154
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
it truly is remarkably lifelike.

155
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,800
It seems your talent for imitation

156
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,360
comes from my father-in-law.

157
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,880
I merely

158
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,360
knows the basics.

159
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,680
However,

160
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,680
there's no calligraphy

161
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
that my father

162
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,800
can't replicate.

163
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
It's just practice.

164
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,040
Nothing to boast about.

165
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,080
Come, dear son-in-law.

166
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,120
Let's have lunch.

167
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,080
Come here.

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,960
Time for lunch.

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,640
Father,

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
we need to head back;

171
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,320
there are still some issues...

172
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,880
Since it's an invitation from Lord Yan,

173
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,680
we should definitely

174
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,960
stay for lunch.

175
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,440
But we need to leave early,

176
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,720
as there are

177
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,680
pressing issues to handle.

178
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Understood.

179
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,840
We got it.

180
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Xing,

181
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
seeing you thrive now

182
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,400
fills my heart with joy.

183
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,880
However...

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,720
Has Lord Zhang reached out to you?

185
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,320
He has brought it up multiple times.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,280
The message is quite clear.

187
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,040
The allotment for the post in Xichen

188
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
remains to be settled.

189
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Should the task he entrusted

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
be poorly executed...

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Regarding Lord Zhang,

192
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,280
I'll provide him with an explanation.

193
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,520
The pigeons' feathers are soft and fluffy.

194
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Quite a few have fallen.

195
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,400
Hmm...

196
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,240
Ya, be quiet!

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
Commander.

198
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,560
Commander?

199
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,560
Commander,

200
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,000
someone went to the pigeon coop.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,720
Who was it?

202
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
It's...

203
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,240
the lady.

204
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,080
She has made her choice after all.

205
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,000
My lord,

206
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,640
the curtain

207
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,000
you asked me to prepare

208
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,600
is ready.

209
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,520
This is a special fabric

210
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,520
from Xichen

211
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,840
that effectively blocks out light.

212
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,720
My lord specifically

213
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,200
asked me to...

214
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,600
It's just perfect

215
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,400
for sword practicing.

216
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,360
What a waste!

217
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,400
Your unpredictable temper

218
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,960
really needs to change.

219
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,080
Otherwise, who would want to serve you?

220
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,680
I remember back at the Yan residence,

221
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
you swore an oath

222
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,720
to serve me faithfully, right?

223
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,080
How could a lady serve

224
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
if she avoids her husband?

225
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,560
Do you truly want me to serve you?

226
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,760
We are husband and wife, after all.

227
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,200
Even if something happens,

228
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,000
no one will gossip about it.

229
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,560
I don't really care about gossips.

230
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
It's only natural for a wife

231
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,120
to serve her husband.

232
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,360
If serving is what you ask for,

233
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
fine!

234
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,920
You smell wonderful, my lord.

235
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,280
Would you like to take a whiff?

236
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,440
See if I smell good.

237
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,120
Challenge me huh, boy?

238
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
Guards,

239
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,440
light up the lamps

240
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,280
over by the lady!

241
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,520
Commander.

242
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,800
Something happened at Ximing Temple.

243
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,520
Imperial Guard has sufficient manpower.

244
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
Commander just

245
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,800
reassigned you back to Ministry of Justice.

246
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,360
Hey...

247
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,160
Who would want to follow you around?

248
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,080
Don't you come begging me to

249
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,800
assist you in the investigation!

250
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,080
The handwriting is neat,

251
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,000
and the brushwork is impressive.

252
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
These blood characters

253
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,040
suddenly appeared on the wall.

254
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,840
It's not blood;

255
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
it's a special stone material

256
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,480
mixed with vermilion to create ink.

257
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
Once applied, it won't show immediately.

258
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,960
It will only reveal its blood-like hue

259
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,360
after being washed by the rain.

260
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,200
The murderer had written it long ago,

261
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,680
just waiting for last night's rain.

262
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,840
There are also blood tears

263
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,760
on the statue in the main hall.

264
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,880
What could be the motive behind this?

265
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
He is clearly taunting us.

266
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
The gods are enraged,

267
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,600
which is why there's blood.

268
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,440
I've heard it said

269
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,560
that when a statue weeps blood,

270
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,960
it signifies the gods mourning the world.

271
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,920
This serves as a warning to us.

272
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
Apologies.

273
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,480
I didn't notice you were here.

274
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,400
I didn't see you cleaning the floor.

275
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,840
Hey, Xing girl,

276
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
you know, our Ministry of Justice

277
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,600
really can't function without you.

278
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,080
You have no idea,

279
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,360
not long ago,

280
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,720
the floor of our office

281
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,920
wasn't even this shinny.

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
My lord, my lord.

283
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,280
Good morning, my lord.

284
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,200
Isn't this Lady Yan, Commander's wife?

285
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,240
Why are you mopping our floor?

286
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,760
Yeah!

287
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,520
I am unworthy of your effort, my lady!

288
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,920
Here, here!

289
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,360
This area still needs some attention.

290
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,320
Wash that cloth.

291
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,560
Then continue mopping.

292
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,720
My lord, your belt has slipped!

293
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,600
Your belt.

294
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,560
Here.

295
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560
Did you two have a quarrel?

296
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,400
No.

297
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,520
No?

298
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,800
If that's the case, then why did you

299
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,920
suddenly come back?

300
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,440
Go on,

301
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,120
what trouble have you stirred up?

302
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,160
My waist seems to gain weight again.

303
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,600
I need to work on it.

304
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
I've taken on the role of a spy.

305
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,160
You were putting...

306
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,440
You're truly playing with fire!

307
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
I've heard that someone once

308
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
snuck into the Shen residence at night

309
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
because he was a spy.

310
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,320
In one night,

311
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,160
not only did he vanish without a trace,

312
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,720
but his entire family...

313
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,200
His whole family was gone.

314
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Moreover,

315
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,880
at midnight,

316
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
someone even saw

317
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,320
them being dragged into hell

318
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,840
by a demon.

319
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,840
Your entire family would be wiped out!

320
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,720
You were really bold!

321
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
This whole thing

322
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,040
is quite complicated.

323
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,400
By the way,

324
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,840
how's going with that thing

325
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
I asked Mr. Xu to do?

326
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,760
Don't worry,

327
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,880
he has already dispatched inspectors

328
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,760
to investigate.

329
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,320
My lord,

330
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,240
Excuse me for the moment.

331
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,560
Don't worry.

332
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,640
Yan Xing,

333
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,320
I forgot to mention something important.

334
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,280
Someone spotted

335
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,120
your master.

336
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,080
He has returned from his journey.

337
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,240
However, as soon as he entered the city,

338
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
he was captured by

339
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,800
by the Imperial Guard.

340
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,920
What?

341
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Where's your Commander?

342
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,160
Shen Du!

343
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,960
Shen Du!

344
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,320
Shen Du...

345
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,000
Commander is busy

346
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,680
and cannot see anyone.

347
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,200
I am his wife!

348
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
How dare you stop me?

349
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
Shen Du!

350
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,320
Get your arse out here!

351
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,240
Get her out of my face!

352
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Shen Du,

353
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,080
come at me if you have a problem!

354
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,320
Why did you arrest my master?

355
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
Don't think too highly of yourself.

356
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
You're overestimating your importance.

357
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
Let my master go!

358
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,440
Shen Du!

359
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
Release my master!

360
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,040
- Let my master go! - Xing?

361
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,400
Master?

362
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,120
My girl,

363
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,680
you're already a married woman,

364
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,120
yet you're still so impulsive.

365
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,040
Master!

366
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,880
You really should cut down on alcohol.

367
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,440
Especially avoid drinking

368
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,720
anything offered by weirdos!

369
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,040
This disciple of mine

370
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,320
is a very straightforward girl.

371
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,200
Commander, please forgive her.

372
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,400
I understand.

373
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,120
What do you understand?

374
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,840
I...

375
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,280
Let's stop the game for now.

376
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,360
Go ahead,

377
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,280
what would you like to know?

378
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,920
I've heard Master Chen has developed a

379
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,000
unique type of vermilion.

380
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,360
It doesn't show when applied,

381
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,720
but reveals itself with water contact.

382
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,480
That's right.

383
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,560
It was originally created

384
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,000
to prevent corpses from decaying.

385
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,160
I wonder if this special vermilion

386
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,240
is exclusive to Master Chen?

387
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,000
Before I retired,

388
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,360
I shared this formula

389
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,440
with a few friends' servants

390
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,720
for pest control purposes.

391
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,520
The results were outstanding.

392
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Please let me know who they were.

393
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,600
I see now.

394
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,320
That explains why the time of the victim's

395
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
disappearance and the time of death

396
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,600
were so far apart.

397
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,240
It delays decay

398
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,400
and repels pests.

399
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,280
Right, it's vermilion!

400
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,480
The corpses were surrounded by herbs.

401
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,280
Initially, I thought

402
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,080
it was to mask the odor of decay.

403
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,680
In reality, it was mixed with a

404
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,120
special preservative vermilion.

405
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,040
That was why the coroner

406
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,960
couldn't accurately determine

407
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,920
the time of death.

408
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
Master, stop drinking!

409
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,000
I wonder if Master Chen

410
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,760
could deduce the

411
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,120
actual time of death.

412
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,640
Come on, my girl, you don't

413
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,520
seem to worry about tiring your master.

414
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Master,

415
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,560
there's a case to solve.

416
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,880
Please bear with it a bit.

417
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,840
Show us your skills!

418
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,760
Master has won

419
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
this round.

420
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,040
I did?

421
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,720
I did!

422
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,480
let's go then.

423
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,000
- Take me to the morgue. - Let's go!

424
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,680
- The morgue. - Master, watch your step.

425
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,000
Master estimated the

426
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,920
actual time of death

427
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,520
based on the degree of preservation.

428
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,280
Early spring of the fourth year of Shengli.

429
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,520
Summer of the fourth year of Shengli.

430
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,880
February or March of the fifth year of Shengli.

431
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,120
June of the sixth year of Shengli.

432
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,520
Mid-August of the sixth year of Shengli.

433
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
Can't we narrow it down any further?

434
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,880
The way I see it,

435
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,360
there's no need for that.

436
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Male victims' stomachs contained these.

437
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,720
Based on the decay of the corpses,

438
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,960
I thought that even if the victims

439
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,600
had eaten before they were murdered,

440
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,880
the contents of their stomachs

441
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,960
should have decayed

442
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,160
along with the bodies.

443
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,760
I was too quick to judge.

444
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
Avoid premature conclusions in forensics.

445
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,200
The more bizarre and shocking the scene,

446
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,560
the more one must follow a systematic approach.

447
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,680
The key

448
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,000
often lies in seemingly

449
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,800
insignificant details.

450
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,120
Melon seeds?

451
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,040
Exactly.

452
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,760
Melon seeds can only be

453
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
digested and expelled

454
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,040
through bowel movement

455
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
while a person is alive,

456
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
and they are typically expelled

457
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
within a day.

458
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,040
They all had seeds in their stomachs,

459
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,920
which suggests they ate them shortly

460
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,080
before they were killed.

461
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,440
What seems logical

462
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,400
is not always the truth.

463
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,920
Even what you see with your own eyes,

464
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,160
may not reflect reality.

465
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,120
Someone may use tricks

466
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,600
to make you believe that is the truth.

467
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,880
I've learned a lot, master.

468
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,680
What a coincidence!

469
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,480
These male victims

470
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,040
all ate melon seeds before they died.

471
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,960
When too many coincidences come together,

472
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,160
they are no longer coincidences.

473
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
These seeds

474
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,880
are not just any ordinary seeds,

475
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,480
but the barbarian melon seeds from Xichen.

476
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,040
Barbarian melons, the tribute?

477
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,520
Aren't they exclusive to the palace?

478
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,160
No,

479
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,120
there's another occasion.

480
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,840
Those gentry males

481
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,560
had the chance to enjoy barbarian melons.

482
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,240
Kaiyang Festival!

483
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,200
The date of the Kaiyang Festival is

484
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,960
determined by the Imperial Astrology Bureau(IAB).

485
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,320
based on celestial observations,

486
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,920
and is funded by the government.

487
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,880
Her Royal Highness will also

488
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,840
bestow rare treasures from the palace.

489
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,840
However, the date changes each year.

490
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,240
The next Kaiyang Festival is...

491
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,400
Three days later.

492
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,000
Commander,

493
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,520
Her Royal Highness is still in a meeting.

494
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,240
Please be patient and wait here.

495
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,040
The statue of Buddha wept blood,

496
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,440
and rumors are spreading wildly.

497
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,000
She has been suffering from migraine,

498
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,960
and even Princess Ying

499
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,320
has been implicated and grounded.

500
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,400
Her Royal Highness' oral edict!

501
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,760
The current situation is dire.

502
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,920
If the case is not resolved

503
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,840
within five days, it will be

504
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,680
handed over to the Imperial Inspectorate.

505
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,760
I, your humble servant,

506
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
accept the edict with gratitude.

507
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
Lord Zhang, if you'd like to meet me,

508
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,880
there's no need for you

509
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,320
to send so many escorts.

510
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,800
Mysterious events were unfolding at Temple

511
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,480
Someone is behind them.

512
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,640
This nursery rhyme is just the beginning.

513
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,080
Things are escalating.

514
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,840
Prince Xian's situation is concerning.

515
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,520
I heard Princess Ying was grounded too.

516
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,680
Her Highness

517
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,600
has reprimanded

518
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,800
all her children.

519
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,280
Please forgive my audacity.

520
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,520
Is the weeping blood of the statue

521
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,000
related to you, my lord?

522
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,840
How dare you!

523
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,360
My question may be abrupt,

524
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
but I only wish to clarify

525
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,120
the truth of the matter

526
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,280
so I could be of help.

527
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,320
This has nothing to do with me.

528
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Also,

529
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,240
how's the investigation that

530
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,160
I tasked you with going?

531
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
I haven't found anything yet.

532
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,200
Are you playing tricks with me, girl?

533
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,120
Aren't you afraid I'll

534
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,880
ruin your family's prospects?

535
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,720
Please allow me to explain, my lord.

536
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,880
You asked me to investigate the pigeons,

537
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,040
which was merely to find out

538
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,680
Her Royal Highness'

539
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
attitude towards Prince Xian.

540
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,120
But based on my investigation,

541
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,240
you could rest easy.

542
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,080
How can you be so sure?

543
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,520
Besides the pigeons,

544
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,040
the communication routes of IG

545
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
have suddenly increased.

546
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,800
Most of these are merely

547
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,280
decoys of turning back midway.

548
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,520
This is intended to conceal

549
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,680
the real route.

550
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,520
Moreover,

551
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,560
a significant number of guardsmen from IG

552
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,680
have been dispatched out of the city.

553
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,280
This is likely to ensure

554
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,600
Prince Xian's safety along the way.

555
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,160
If they intend to harm him,

556
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,680
why go through all this trouble?

557
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,080
That said,

558
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,560
this is merely your personal

559
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,440
speculation.

560
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,760
Isn't it also your speculation

561
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,040
that Prince Xian is in danger?

562
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,160
I'll take your word for it for now.

563
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,280
However,

564
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,440
I'd like to wrap up the whole thing soon.

565
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Rest assured, my lord,

566
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,400
I will soon uncover

567
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,840
the true mastermind behind all this.

568
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,280
Good.

569
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,960
The transferring order for the position

570
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,440
at the border will be issued shortly.

571
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,080
The time for you and your father

572
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,440
is running out.

573
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,600
Your Royal Highness,

574
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,240
if you don't make a move,

575
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,120
I

576
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,160
will win this round.

577
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,400
Fine.

578
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,280
If Your Highness is fine with this,

579
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,320
I will ask for a reward.

580
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,200
Sure, tell me,

581
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,360
what do you want?

582
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,080
Regarding this year's Kaiyang Festival,

583
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,960
thanks to Your Highness' gracious favor,

584
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,560
the celebration is being prepared by me.

585
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,560
So, can I also

586
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,640
have a say in who to invite?

587
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
In past celebrations,

588
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,400
guests would recite poetry

589
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,680
and sing melodious songs.

590
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,040
This time,

591
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,600
can we invite some

592
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,680
real talented scholars and fair ladies?

593
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,000
Invite whoever you wish.

594
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,120
Is there a fair maiden

595
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,880
who has caught your eye?

596
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,440
Gratitude,

597
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,320
Your Royal Highness.

598
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,360
Lady Xu,

599
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,920
this is the list you provided.

600
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,160
I have included all of them

601
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,560
on the guest list.

602
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,880
Gratitude, Lord Zhang.

603
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,760
Don't mention it.

604
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,360
In the future, I hope you

605
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,160
will extend me a bit more favor.

606
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,880
So,

607
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,560
those who know the vermilion formula

608
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,560
are already on the guest list

609
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,880
for the Kaiyang Festival celebration.

610
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,080
The murderer is among them.

611
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,360
Finding the murderer among these people

612
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,279
is certainly not an easy task.

613
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,520
It would be better to

614
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,520
let the murderer come to us.

615
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,719
This way, we can save ourselves

616
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,640
a lot of trouble.

617
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,520
The female victims share striking

618
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,520
similarities in their appearances.

619
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,239
Moreover, they are all skilled

620
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,560
pipa performers.

621
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:11,640
If I disguise myself like them,

622
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,520
I can attract the murderer's attention.

623
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,279
This way, the murderer will take action.

624
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:15,920
At that point,

625
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,360
you can capture him on the spot.

626
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,080
No.

627
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,840
This is far too risky.

628
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,000
It can't be you.

629
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,120
I...

630
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,320
Go find someone from Tongming Pavilion.

631
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,200
And have her disguise as the target.

632
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,200
Understood.

633
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,920
No.

634
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,200
The musicians at Tongming Pavilion

635
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
are just civilians.

636
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,400
How can we risk

637
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,800
the lives of civilians?

638
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,600
Besides,

639
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,560
the murderer's methods

640
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
are extremely cruel.

641
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,760
What if something goes wrong?

642
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,160
How will you explain to their families?

643
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
So you are aware of the risk involved.

644
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,840
If something happens to you...

645
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,720
how will I explain to Her Highness,

646
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,360
Lord Zhang, and your father?

647
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,800
I'm the one who

648
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,880
insisted on investigating this case.

649
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,560
If I hadn't intervened,

650
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,080
it would have been closed long ago.

651
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,240
Now, we are getting so close.

652
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,960
I should see it through to the end.

653
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,800
This is official business,

654
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
so lady officials should take the risk.

655
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,680
You expect me to endanger

656
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,440
the lives of civilian girls?

657
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,280
I simply can't.

658
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,440
If you wish to participate,

659
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,520
you need to assess your qualifications.

660
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,600
You need to be skilled at playing pipa.

661
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,920
Can you do that?

662
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,080
My lady's abilities

663
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,400
caught me off guard.

664
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,000
How was it?

665
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,520
Do you consider me "skilled?"

666
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
My lady, you truly have exquisite skills.

667
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,240
Play another piece for us.

668
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,400
I'm tired.

669
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,760
Let's call it a day.

670
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,600
Are you tired, or just not good enough?

671
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,200
When the time comes,

672
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
are you planning

673
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,760
to only play these few lines

674
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,320
at the Kaiyang celebration?

675
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,440
I

676
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,000
haven't really prepared for this.

677
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,040
I'll just speak off the cuff.

678
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,920
Let me give you

679
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
a few key points.

680
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,040
First, when you play,

681
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,520
this outfit won't be suitable.

682
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,320
You should wear something

683
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
appealing.

684
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,120
That is... unnecessary, right?

685
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,560
How well you play

686
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,080
doesn't really matter.

687
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,040
The key relies on your vibe.

688
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Look carefully.

689
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,400
You know the poses, right?

690
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,320
Let's start with the...

691
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,960
Extend your leg.

692
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,560
Cross your legs.

693
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,600
Exactly.

694
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,840
Take it slow.

695
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,160
Now spin.

696
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,040
Spin around.

697
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,880
Twirl, twirl.

698
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,160
Look at the skirt twirling.

699
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,880
That's it!

700
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,080
So graceful.

701
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,400
Mom, mom!

702
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,600
Could you sit back here and play?

703
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,000
You keep spinning,

704
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,920
and I can't see your fingerings clearly.

705
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,920
Fingerings don't matter.

706
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,440
What comes next matters the most.

707
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,240
Watch closely.

708
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,280
Raise your pipa above your head.

709
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,600
Bring it down from behind your head.

710
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,680
Your posture should be enchanting.

711
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,520
Show your face.

712
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,920
Eyes are the key. Watch me in the eyes.

713
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,680
The charm of a woman.

714
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,680
Eyes, remember?

715
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,880
Look into my eyes.

716
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,440
That's right.

717
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,720
Pay attention to this part.

718
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,880
Now spin again.

719
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,920
Then shake it!

720
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,400
Normally,

721
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,160
your dress should be

722
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,080
already off on the floor.

723
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,840
Mom, please.

724
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,120
You can dance later.

725
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,040
You should sit down for now.

726
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,200
I just want to focus on learning a piece.

727
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
It's not about how many pieces you know,

728
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,840
but about mastering one well.

729
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,480
Back then,

730
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,880
I only played one piece.

731
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,120
A true master

732
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,040
doesn't need a second piece at all.

733
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,560
And your dad,

734
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
he never managed to get through

735
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,560
the first one.

736
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
No, mom.

737
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
What are you talking about?

738
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,640
Just now, what I taught you,

739
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,240
that one...

740
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,760
After the spinning,

741
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,640
a man

742
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,360
couldn't hold himself back at all.

743
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,280
Mother.

744
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,680
I just want to

745
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,920
really learn a piece.

746
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,360
It's for my investigation.

747
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,400
What do you think it is for?

748
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,600
I thought

749
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,520
you wanted me to teach you some skills

750
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,760
for the joy between men and women.

751
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,000
The pipa ignites fires of passion.

752
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
That's not what I want!

753
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,960
Uncle.

754
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,280
Exactly what's going on

755
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,800
in my mother's mind all day?

756
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,360
Just because I got married,

757
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,640
does that mean everything I think and do

758
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,920
has to be related to

759
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,400
how to please my husband?

760
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
Your mother was sent to the music hall

761
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,000
since she was little.

762
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Back in the day, the impresario

763
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
taught us to be

764
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,440
extremely tolerant.

765
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,680
To humble ourselves.

766
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,880
To entertain others with our charm.

767
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,040
Fortunately, your father showed her

768
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,120
kindness, which provided her with a

769
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,840
place to call home.

770
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,520
So in your mother's eyes,

771
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,520
the best fate

772
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,680
for her daughter would be to find

773
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,560
a good husband to share her life with.

774
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,160
Based on that standards,

775
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,520
I certainly don't have

776
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,800
a good fate.

777
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,080
The man I married is not a good one.

778
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,080
Your mother has repeatedly sent word to me

779
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,400
to ensure I navigate things

780
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,280
for you in the palace.

781
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So you will not be harmed by White...

782
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,760
Your husband,

783
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,680
to bring you harm.

784
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,800
Now that you are

785
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,920
safe and sound,

786
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,400
so she can ease her mind.

787
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,320
Yet she spends her days worrying about

788
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,960
how to secure your position

789
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
as the primary wife.

790
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,960
She is overly concerned about me.

791
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,640
As for the primary wife,

792
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,840
whoever wants it can have it.

793
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,920
I don't need a man's protection.

794
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,360
I just hope

795
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
I could become

796
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,680
a strong and capable woman

797
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,000
to protect myself

798
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
and my family.

799
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,360
I, Yan Xing, am fortunate

800
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,680
to have been born in a dynasty

801
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,440
where women can hold positions of power,

802
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,280
and don't need to leverage beauty for others' sake.

803
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,200
However, at this moment,

804
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,240
I truly need

805
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,920
a pipa performance that can captivate

806
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,200
all the spectators.

807
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,280
You mentioned earlier

808
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,240
that it's for your investigation.

809
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,480
I need to perform a pipa piece

810
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,080
on the stage of

811
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,400
the Liushang Theater

812
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,520
Draw out the fox from its den.
