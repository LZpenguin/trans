00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:48,080
Melody of Golden Age EP25

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,520
"Disrespecting the fire moth"

4
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,880
"brings disaster from above."

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,840
This phrase

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,760
also conceals a threat.

7
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,000
If we persist in our investigation

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,880
and prevent them from causing chaos,

9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,360
you and your loved ones

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,800
might face unforeseen calamities.

11
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
How could you say such things to my lady?

12
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,160
Are you deliberately

13
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,200
causing her distress?

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,320
With her intellect, it's only a matter

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,960
of time before she figures this out.

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,000
- I... - I merely gave her a heads-up

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,920
in advance.

18
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,640
What's the matter?

19
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
Did you see a healer?

20
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm perfectly fine.

21
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,080
Thank you for your concern.

22
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't overexert yourself.

23
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,760
That will cause me to worry.

24
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,200
You must stay safe.

25
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,880
Otherwise,

26
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,200
who prepares medicinal dishes for me?

27
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
Shen Du.

28
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
I just can't muster the strength

29
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
to bicker with you today.

30
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,520
Alright then.

31
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
I misspoke just now.

32
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,520
What's really bothering you?

33
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Shen Du,

34
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,920
I have a passion for investigation.

35
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm passionate about the quest for truth,

36
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
but I prefer to keep my family out of it.

37
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,880
The Fire Moth Sect communicated with

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
me through the messages on the corpses.

39
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,440
They have meticulously planned everything

40
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,640
and intentionally staged a show for us.

41
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,880
They're demonstrating their power to us.

42
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,920
This is a warning!

43
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
You fear that if you continue,

44
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,680
it may endanger your family.

45
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
When we were in Xiang'an,

46
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,040
if we hadn't arrived in time,

47
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,360
Caiwei and Mr. Han

48
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,840
would have already lost their lives.

49
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,600
If...

50
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,560
If they really are targeting

51
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,000
my family

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,360
while I am in Yingzhou,

53
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,440
what would I do?

54
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,680
How can I shield them

55
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,720
from harm when I'm so distant?

56
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,600
I pondered for four hours,

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,920
and I truly have no solution.

58
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,080
If you wish,

59
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,080
I can arrange a carriage to take you back.

60
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,640
As for the business in here,

61
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,280
you need not worry about it.

62
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,080
What about you?

63
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,960
Can you carry on without me?

64
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Me?

65
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,440
Does my lady wish

66
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,320
for me to personally

67
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,640
escort you back home?

68
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,440
We cannot return.

69
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,200
You're the commander of the Imperial Guard.

70
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,360
I'm an archivist.

71
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,280
We are on a

72
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
crucial mission.

73
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,000
I knew it.

74
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,760
You would never leave.

75
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,440
A fleeting emotion won't diminish

76
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
your enthusiasm for investigation.

77
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,040
Don't act like

78
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,920
you understand me so well.

79
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Have you regained your composure?

80
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
This is the Yan Xing I know,

81
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,960
sharp-tongued and unyielding.

82
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,240
Of course,

83
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,280
you are not intimidated by authority and

84
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,640
have the tenacity to face challenges head-on.

85
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,040
I...

86
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,480
I know you are concerned

87
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
about your family's safety.

88
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,480
I, Shen Du, assure you

89
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
that the things you fear

90
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,840
will absolutely not come to pass.

91
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,280
Before coming to Gannan,

92
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,360
I made contingency plans.

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,720
As it stands,

94
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,720
everything is well under control.

95
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,520
Do you still remember

96
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,760
that letter from Xiang'an?

97
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,000
An urgent letter from Xiang'an?

98
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
Who sent it?

99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Lady Xu.

100
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,080
Of course I remember.

101
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240
During the Garment Bestowal Festival(Garment Festival\Day),

102
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
The Great Grandmother, every year,

103
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,840
would go to

104
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,760
the Lishan Hot Springs Retreat

105
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,520
and would reward some officials' families

106
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
to accompany her.

107
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,360
The letter from Lady Xu informed me

108
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640
that the members of the Yan Family

109
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
have been included on the list.

110
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,840
Within Her Majesty'

111
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,040
line of sight,

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,480
I believe no faction

113
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,240
would dare to act recklessly.

114
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,120
Why didn't you tell me, Shen Du!

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,279
However,

116
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,679
there is indeed one thing

117
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,600
that may not seem urgent,

118
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,360
but nonetheless,

119
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,360
it is connected to you.

120
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,560
What is it?

121
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,560
Regarding that headless corpse case,

122
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
the suspect's brother-in-law,

123
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
Ji Dafu, has shown up.

124
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,560
This Ji Dafu

125
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,800
has a rather unique background.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
The deceased and the suspect

127
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,520
are both the elder brother of his wife.

128
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Please, my lord,

129
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,200
I am begging you here.

130
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,120
When will my brother-in-law's case

131
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,800
be closed?

132
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,480
I can accept that

133
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
the head is missing,

134
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
but can we

135
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,400
allow the body to be buried soon?

136
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,000
Ji Dafu,

137
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
please remain calm.

138
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,520
This case is still under investigation.

139
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,240
Lord Mo,

140
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
are you looking for me?

141
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
I heard you have some new suggestions

142
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,760
regarding this case?

143
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,160
There are some anomalies in this case

144
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,880
that I am still investigating.

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,600
My suggestion is to investigate

146
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,560
this case alongside the

147
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,600
bride abduction case.

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
If we combine the cases,

149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,480
the investigation duration

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,880
will likely be extended,

151
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,760
and that could mean...

152
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,560
Mr. Pan,

153
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,880
what do you mean by that?

154
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,520
I see you, the so-called top detective,

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,760
are all name and no game!

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
What's with your rule

157
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,240
of never meeting the employer?

158
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,320
I think you are just

159
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
afraid of failing

160
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
and embarrassing yourself!

161
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,080
Today,

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,560
let's do this in front of Lord Mo;

163
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,800
just give me a straight answer:

164
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,960
Can you solve the case and catch

165
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
the murderer within five days?

166
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,840
If you can't catch him,

167
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,880
return my money

168
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,120
so I can find someone else!

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,120
If the case cannot be solved,

170
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,280
I will refund the money for sure,

171
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,200
but I am already

172
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,840
close to identifying the murderer.

173
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,320
Who is the murderer?

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
The murderer is

175
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
the masked specter.

176
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,480
To avoid refunding,

177
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,960
your friend

178
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,360
threw out the ghost theory.

179
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,720
It actually worked.

180
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,560
Upon hearing that, Ji Dafu

181
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,480
was visibly shocked and took his leave.

182
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,400
However, Lord Mo

183
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,280
was not so easy to deceive.

184
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
Mr. Pan,

185
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,240
I have submitted the bride abduction case

186
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,520
to the Ministry of Justice for closure.

187
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,840
Lord Mo,

188
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,040
I have provided a new statement.

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,480
I have reviewed it.

190
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,120
So why is it being closed so hastily?

191
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,360
Xu Jize has new testimony, which could

192
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,880
potentially lead to a lighter sentence.

193
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
The eyeless corpse reveals a hidden plot

194
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,520
and is linked to the headless corpse case.

195
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,200
Mr. Pan,

196
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
this is not Xiang'an!

197
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,880
This is not Xiang'an.

198
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,040
The Yingzhou has been

199
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,320
embroiled in conflict for decades.

200
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,040
The situation in here is precarious.

201
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,840
Although we've established provincial

202
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,000
governance, Xichen eyes our lands with ambition.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,880
Historically, it has been

204
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,920
invaded by Xichen numerous times.

205
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
To quell the unrest in the Western Regions

206
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,280
and prevent the resurgence of war,

207
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,880
we must unite the hearts of the people.

208
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,480
But do you know what

209
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,040
is essential to achieve that?

210
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,760
Please enlighten me, my lord.

211
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,720
What is essential

212
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,840
is long-term stability.

213
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
It requires severe punishment to

214
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
eradicate evil, to solve every case,

215
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,920
and to apprehend every criminal.

216
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,480
It's essential to instill in people

217
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
the belief that as long as the officials

218
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,120
are on duty,

219
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,080
the Yingzhou

220
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,720
will be a place where the citizens

221
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,520
can live their lives in peace.

222
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Thus,

223
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
strict laws must be enforced.

224
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,600
Xu Jize's head is

225
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,040
destined to be displayed on the city wall,

226
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,600
serving as a

227
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
dreadful warning to others, correct?

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,080
Scummy was utterly wicked,

229
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,440
his death is of no consequence

230
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,520
and does not require investigation.

231
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,560
Xu Jize perpetrated

232
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,800
the violation of a married woman.

233
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
His guilt is amplified to a higher degree.

234
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,200
He has violated border laws,

235
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
so he can't escape the death penalty.

236
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
However, I can assure you

237
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,120
that he will die peacefully

238
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,160
and his head will not be

239
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,800
displayed on the city wall.

240
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,760
You have shared this

241
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,240
with me in such detail

242
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,640
not merely to highlight how embarrassing

243
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,560
it was for Pan Chi today, right?

244
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
You want to convey to me

245
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,080
the importance of understanding Lord Mo,

246
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,600
who was intervening in the case

247
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,400
and was eager to bring it to a close.

248
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,440
His position means

249
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,720
he can't pursue the truth of the case

250
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,200
with the same unwavering focus as we do.

251
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
You are reminding me

252
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
to be more empathetic towards

253
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
Lord Mo's circumstances

254
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,680
and not to doubt

255
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,280
his genuine concern for the people.

256
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,520
What I want to convey to you

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,840
is that people are inherently complex

258
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
and we shouldn't rush to conclusions.

259
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,480
Shen Du.

260
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,320
Shen Du!

261
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,960
How much do you

262
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,760
trust Mo Qianzhi?

263
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,960
He used to be the one I trusted the most.

264
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,240
And what about now?

265
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,600
Now...

266
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,080
Now,

267
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
he is the one I most wish to trust.

268
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,720
To uncover the truth,

269
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,320
one must inevitably navigate

270
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,920
the very process you are experiencing now.

271
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
Regardless of how trivial the detail,

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
or how familiar the person,

273
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,880
first, do not shy away from doubt,

274
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,120
and have the courage to verify everything.

275
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Trust

276
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,520
can also serve as

277
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,040
a powerful tool in investigation!

278
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,000
The Fire Moth Sect has deeply infiltrated Yingzhou.

279
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,200
Shen is closely tied to Mo.

280
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,480
- Leave now! - Please, take another look!

281
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,080
Get out!

282
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
- Just one more time. - Go away!

283
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,960
Enough!

284
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,880
- Piss off! - Read it once more!

285
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,960
Just leave!

286
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,240
Excuse me,

287
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
bring me another pot of wine!

288
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,760
Alright!

289
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,360
Yan Xing?

290
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,960
Why are you here?

291
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,760
What are you doing here?

292
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,200
Take a look!

293
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,840
Please, have a look.

294
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Welcome!

295
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,440
These are quite trendy!

296
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,960
Xing,

297
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
what are you doing here?

298
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,360
I...

299
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,360
came to take a stroll with the pigeon.

300
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,840
Take a stroll with the pigeon?

301
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,560
Xing,

302
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
do you realize

303
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,480
that the specialty of this eatery

304
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,120
is roasted pigeon?

305
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,360
But on that note,

306
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,760
isn't it a bit cruel

307
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
to treat your pigeon

308
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
this way?

309
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,440
Letting it witness

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,600
its own grim fate.

311
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
This drink

312
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,680
is dedicated to that poor pigeon.

313
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,720
You're not here to drown

314
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,800
your sorrows

315
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,520
after being criticized by Ji Dafu

316
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,080
this afternoon, are you?

317
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,239
Good news travels slowly,

318
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,040
but bad news spreads like wildfire.

319
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,080
To me, Ji Dafu

320
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,959
is insignificant.

321
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,120
His words

322
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,479
are not worth my attention.

323
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,680
Then you are drinking because...

324
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,040
the case is closed?

325
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,320
I heard you received new testimony

326
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,840
regarding the bride abduction case.

327
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,959
Any findings?

328
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,160
Findings?

329
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,680
There are no new findings,

330
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,800
just some irrelevant testimonies.

331
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,880
However,

332
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,720
to collect evidence,

333
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,320
I went to the prison to see Xu Jize.

334
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,080
After questioning him,

335
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,600
as I was about to leave,

336
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,160
he suddenly said to me...

337
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,920
Mr. Pan!

338
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,400
You are also an educated

339
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,880
man from a humble background, right?

340
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,560
With your courage and eloquence,

341
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,440
why aren't you serving as an official

342
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,360
but instead working as a lowly

343
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,680
civilian detective?

344
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
Let me take a wild guess,

345
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,280
you and I are of the same kind,

346
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,760
burdened by our lowly origins!

347
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Please, don't shut me out!

348
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,000
My poetry has been

349
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,840
submitted to my lord for over a month.

350
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,000
I wonder if my lord has read it?

351
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,360
What a persistent stray dog!

352
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
With that shabby appearance,

353
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,000
he still expects my lord to recommend him?

354
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,440
We are not the same type of people.

355
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,720
No matter how much I resent it,

356
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,880
I would never stoop

357
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,440
to vent my frustrations on the weak!

358
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,200
The weak?

359
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,280
No,

360
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,400
I never bully the weak!

361
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,480
I target

362
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,960
those who have always

363
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,680
oppressed and humiliated the humble,

364
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,120
the gentry families!

365
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,040
They were born to sit in high positions

366
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,560
and treat us humble folks

367
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,080
as their servants.

368
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,840
I have indeed defiled their bride,

369
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,120
and I want them to experience

370
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,600
the bitter sensation of humiliation.

371
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,280
This sensation

372
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
is something we humble folks have endured

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
for generations.

374
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,960
Now that it has come to this,

375
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,520
do you still not see your wrongdoing?

376
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,480
I do!

377
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,640
In the case of Lady Du, I admit

378
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,960
I made a mistake by not being observant!

379
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
The so-called lack of observation refers

380
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,560
to the fact that when you were about to

381
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,400
abduct her, you found out the Lis were

382
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,160
not even considered to be gentry, right?

383
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,400
Indeed, you are quite the detective!

384
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,440
After Lady Du was kidnapped,

385
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,920
scummy claimed that

386
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
the Li Family is a wealthy household.

387
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,520
They built their wealth from

388
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,800
small businesses founded by Li Hongfa.

389
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,040
However, he was determined

390
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,400
to have his son enter the officialdom,

391
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,160
and because

392
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,400
he was a merchant *The lowest social status in ancient China

393
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,880
Li Zimo, like me, later

394
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,800
had Li Hongfa spend a large sum of money

395
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,440
to erase his past and assume

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
a false identity as a gentry.

397
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,040
Li Zimo

398
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,680
was then able to take the exams.

399
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,280
So you ultimately decided

400
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
to cease your criminal activities

401
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,280
and began arguing with scummy?

402
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,920
Yes,

403
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,080
we had quite a heated argument!

404
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,040
Later, I realized that we seemed

405
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,840
to be tailed, prompting us to stop.

406
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,960
But throughout this ordeal,

407
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,480
my intention was always to return her

408
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,360
to her rightful place.

409
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
I didn't see a murder case coming.

410
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm not the one that killed scummy!

411
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,280
I

412
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
returned Du Xiaowan in one piece.

413
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,200
I will honestly report everything

414
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
you stated

415
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,120
for the sake of sentencing.

416
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
If we adhere to the law, it could

417
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,240
indeed result in a lighter sentence.

418
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,120
But to me,

419
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,480
you are nothing but

420
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,960
a complete coward!

421
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,960
The wrath of the valiant

422
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,880
is directed at the strong;

423
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,360
the wrath of the craven

424
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,120
is directed at the weak.

425
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,920
You lack the courage to confront

426
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,800
your true oppressors,

427
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,520
yet you prey upon

428
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,440
helpless women.

429
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,120
This isn't revenge;

430
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,600
you're merely a petty coward who

431
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,560
bullies the kind and fears the wicked.

432
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,800
Sentencing?

433
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,320
That has long been decided!

434
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,080
I am doomed to die!

435
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,160
Since you just arrived in here,

436
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,840
you don't understand this Lord Mo.

437
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,120
Since the first day of my imprisonment,

438
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,480
I've never expected to get out alive.

439
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,280
You are right.

440
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,840
I brought this upon myself,

441
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
digging my own grave.

442
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,840
No, I shouldn't

443
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,960
have been born into this world.

444
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,960
In my next life,

445
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,240
I would rather be an

446
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,440
illiterate farmer

447
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,360
than a

448
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
mediocre

449
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,360
bookworm.

450
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
You should stop drinking.

451
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,600
Hey,

452
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,920
don't serve him any more wine.

453
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,280
Bring him a bowl of lamb noodle.

454
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,840
Alrighty!

455
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,280
Here, please.

456
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,760
The lamb from the Gannan region

457
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,360
is a renowned delicacy.

458
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,160
Trust me.

459
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
Instead of seeking escape in alcohol,

460
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,080
let a bowl of soup be your comfort.

461
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
Give it a try!

462
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,840
How is it?

463
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,320
The flavor is indeed delightful!

464
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,840
See? I didn't lie to you.

465
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,440
"Laughing to the heavens, I depart,"

466
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,560
"Striding across the divine land."

467
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,000
"The noble may hold themselves high,"

468
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,080
"To me, they're but dust in the wind."

469
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,600
"The humble may see themselves low,"

470
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,480
"Yet who can deny their worth?"

471
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,520
"Shaking off the dust, I survey the mountains,"

472
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,680
"Washing my feet in the long river."

473
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,720
Xing,

474
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,920
why are you suddenly reciting this?

475
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,520
I just feel that

476
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,400
this poetry is bold and grand.

477
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,440
In just a few strokes, it reveals

478
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
the oppression of the humble.

479
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,160
What a delightfully biting critique!

480
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,520
Once this piece was published,

481
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,760
it spread throughout the capital.

482
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
Even in those days,

483
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,320
the young gentry of Xiang'an City

484
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,560
were cautious not to flaunt their status

485
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,080
when dining out, for fear of stirring

486
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,200
the undercurrents of public discontent.

487
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,280
You've set the stage so thoroughly,

488
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,640
surely it's not merely to

489
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,840
flatter my literary skills, right?

490
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,760
Of course not.

491
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,360
I also want to commend you:

492
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,600
I truly admire your courage.

493
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
As long as one maintains the

494
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,200
bravery to challenge decaying authority,

495
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
sometimes a single phrase

496
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
or a piece of poetry

497
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,840
can wield immense power.

498
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,200
I understand

499
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,840
the current plight of humble families

500
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,160
may leave you feeling disheartened.

501
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,240
But as long as we

502
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,440
refuse to lose hope,

503
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,560
I believe there will come a day

504
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,640
when the talented from humble origins

505
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
honorably embrace their

506
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,840
rightful future.

507
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,760
I can't quite tell if it's

508
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,200
because the noodle is remarkably delicious

509
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,520
or if your words

510
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,800
have truly inspired me.

511
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,440
I now feel rejuvenated

512
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,880
and could take on ten more cases!

513
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,840
No, stop,

514
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
we should avoid having

515
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
more cases in Gannan.

516
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,040
At this moment,

517
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,640
we've already reached the point that

518
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,920
there's no time for a break.

519
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,800
If there're more on the way,

520
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
I truly can't keep going like this.

521
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,280
There's something

522
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,600
I'd like you to know.

523
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,720
If you are facing any abuse,

524
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,320
you don't have to tolerate it.

525
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,920
Who says that

526
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,160
the residence of The White Death

527
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
is a place you can enter but not escape?

528
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,400
In my view, Shen Du is

529
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,480
not as intimidating as he appears to be.

530
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,560
Just say the word,

531
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,800
and I, Pan Chi, will gladly

532
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,120
confront him for you and

533
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,600
help you break free from your troubles.

534
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,880
Wait, are you misunderstanding something?

535
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,160
No one is abusing me.

536
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,680
If no one is abusing you,

537
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
then how did you get

538
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,720
that lump on your forehead?

539
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,560
Every time I see you, there's

540
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,680
always a new bruise alongside an old one.

541
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,600
Or is it from somewhere else?

542
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,600
I got it at home indeed.

543
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
How can I explain this to you?

544
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,520
In short,

545
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Shen Du truly hasn't mistreated me.

546
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,560
Although marrying into the Shen Family

547
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,640
is somewhat absurd, this

548
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,040
marriage is not what he desired either.

549
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,480
But overall,

550
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,320
Shen Du is a decent husband.

551
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,400
He genuinely cares

552
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,560
for me and my family.

553
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Moreover,

554
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,080
I will eventually part ways with him.

555
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,960
Whether it's Shen Du

556
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,200
or myself,

557
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,520
we both understand

558
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,560
that day is approaching.

559
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,080
Why is that?

560
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,760
Because in his heart,

561
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
there has always been someone else,

562
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,800
and that person is not me.

563
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
The role of his wife

564
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,040
was never truly meant for me.

565
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,560
My lady,

566
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,360
Lord Mo appreciates your busy schedule

567
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,960
and has specially arranged for you

568
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,320
to visit the renowned Yixi Pool in

569
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,400
Yingzhou for some relaxation.

570
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,480
Fair lady,

571
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,720
our Yixi Pool is just

572
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
as good as the royal Lishan hot springs.

573
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
It draws from the

574
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,640
millennium waters of Xiling Mountain,

575
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,240
enhanced by natural geothermal heat.

576
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,880
The pool is infused with

577
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,200
dozens of fragrant herbs.

578
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,000
It boosts vitality for men,

579
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,440
and enhances beauty for women.

580
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,600
Its benefits are well-known.

581
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,760
Couples seeking offsprings

582
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,920
from all around Gannan region

583
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
often come here

584
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,240
to soak.

585
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,880
Thank you for the detailed explanation.

586
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,840
You must be exhausted guiding me,

587
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,280
so please leave and take a break.

588
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Oh, no, no,

589
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,080
I haven't even help you

590
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
into your silk dress yet!

591
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,280
Who is it?

592
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Me.

593
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
Why are you here?

594
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,520
I'm here to

595
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,600
enjoy the hot spring.

596
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,920
This is for women only!

597
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
You should go to another spot.

598
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,920
The Yixi Pool is just one pool,

599
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,600
No separation between men and women.

600
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Besides, Lord Mo arranged

601
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,880
for us to soak together as a couple.

602
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,240
If we were to soak separately,

603
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,760
wouldn't that seem odd?

604
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,760
What would those people outside think?

605
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,440
There are people outside?

606
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,800
There are a few maids and servants

607
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,680
waiting outside.

608
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,520
Even if it's just for appearances,

609
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,280
I should soak with you.

610
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,360
I'm coming in now.

611
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
Wait, wait!

612
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,400
Don't get in just yet!

613
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,880
Turn around

614
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,600
and close your eyes.

615
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,080
Are you feeling shy

616
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,240
and hesitant to soak with me?

617
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,560
I'm not shy at all!

618
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,320
I'm just worried you might be fidgety

619
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,040
and make things awkward for me.

620
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,360
Alright, you can open your eyes now.

621
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,280
Come on in.

622
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,760
Now I can't see anything at all.

623
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,880
Where do I step down from?

624
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh no,

625
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,200
his eyesight isn't great.

626
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,440
I should have left a candle for him.

627
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,920
I could have blown it out after he got in.

628
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,080
Just wait a moment,

629
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,880
Let me help you.

630
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,000
You mentioned that in my heart

631
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,960
there has always been someone.

632
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,760
Who is that person?

633
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,200
Mo Xiuxiu?

634
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,560
No, I can't answer this.

635
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,240
That would reveal that I was eavesdropping

636
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,960
on his conversation with Mo Qianzhi.

637
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,320
Shen Du,

638
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,840
why were you eavesdropping on me?

639
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,840
Can't you

640
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,320
just ask me directly?

641
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,240
If I ask now,

642
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,880
would you dare to answer?

643
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,960
Of course I would!

644
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,120
I've always heard

645
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,280
My lord is known for disinterest in women,

646
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,800
and I wholeheartedly concur with this.

647
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Within the Shen residence,

648
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,440
there are hardly any concubines,

649
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,320
let alone maids,

650
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,960
Add to that

651
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,200
your constant displeasure with me;

652
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,480
doesn't that say it all?

653
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,920
I avoid women

654
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,640
because I already have

655
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
someone I hold dear in my heart.

656
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,680
So I misunderstood, then?

657
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,960
I met her

658
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,320
when we were children.

659
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
I still treasure the

660
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,960
little woven pig she made.

661
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Because of her,

662
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,960
I managed to survive

663
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,000
in that dark place.

664
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,960
Indeed,

665
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,360
thanks to Xiuxiu's brother pleading for mercy,

666
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,800
he was spared execution

667
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,320
and sent to the Custodial Ward instead.

668
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,080
Every night,

669
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
she would quietly slip into the garden

670
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,040
to bring me comfort and food.

671
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,320
In those dark days,

672
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,640
that was the light

673
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,000
I eagerly awaited each night.

674
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,880
I didn't even know

675
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,240
her name

676
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,400
nor had I ever seen her face clearly.

677
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,840
The only gift I ever gave her

678
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,600
was a copper whistle.

679
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,440
This whistle was a gift from my father.

680
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:00,839
I remember her telling me once

681
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
that one day

682
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,880
she'd take me out openly and with dignity.

683
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:07,240
One day,

684
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,080
I'll help the Shen Family clear your name

685
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,359
and take you out openly and with dignity.

686
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,240
Years passed,

687
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,920
and I never saw her again.

688
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,280
It was as if she had vanished.

689
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,600
Until one day,

690
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,560
as if it were fate,

691
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,400
she became my wife.

692
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
But the ironic part is,

693
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,040
at that time,

694
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
I had no clue she was

695
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,640
the girl I had cherished in my memories.

696
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,960
Eventually, I learned the truth,

697
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,800
and I hope it's not too late.

698
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,720
I want to let her know

699
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,440
that in my heart,

700
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,120
from the very beginning,

701
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,800
the one has always been her.

702
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,400
-I... -You...

703
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,520
-You... -I...

704
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,160
You go first.

705
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,160
How did you know

706
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,080
that rattan pig was made by me?

707
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,920
You've been

708
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,040
pondering for so long

709
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,960
just to ask this?

710
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,440
I've known from the very start

711
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,600
that it wasn't Xiuxiu who made it.

712
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,480
You're so talented!

713
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,680
I want to weave one

714
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,600
for Du as a birthday gift.

715
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,480
But no matter how hard I try

716
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,720
it still turns out to be ugly.

717
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,080
Can we

718
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,280
trade?

719
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,240
Of course, take it!

720
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,920
Thank you!

721
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,960
You are so nice!

722
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,400
On my birthday,

723
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,840
I received that little pig.

724
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,280
I had originally intended to find a way

725
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
to express my gratitude to you.

726
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,880
But then I learned your family took you.

727
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,720
At that time, I was still wrapped up in

728
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,880
the joy of knowing my father

729
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,800
hadn't abandoned me.

730
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,360
He was just a bit late due to his duties.

731
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,120
I didn't pay attention to my surroundings.

732
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I never expected that

733
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,760
you had kept the rattan pig all along.

734
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,280
Later on,

735
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,480
the Shen Family was raided.

736
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
That rattan pig

737
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,200
became one of the few belongings

738
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,480
I could hold onto.

739
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,160
So I kept it close to my heart.

740
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
It also reminds me of

741
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,560
the cherished moments when

742
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,680
my father taught me weaving.

743
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,080
It wasn't until recently that I discovered

744
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,800
you are actually the same girl.

745
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,120
The Custodial Ward...

746
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,680
You promised you'd come to get me,

747
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,680
but why did you stop showing up?

748
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,360
Because

749
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,440
I crawled in through the dog hole

750
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,640
in the garden.

751
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,480
Later, they discovered

752
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
that hole

753
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,440
and patched it up.

754
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,800
After that,

755
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,040
you didn't even need me to free you.

756
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,560
Thank you.

757
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
You still came to lead me home.
