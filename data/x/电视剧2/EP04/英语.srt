Melody of Golden Age EP04

3
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
My lord, good morning.

4
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,360
It's quite late.

5
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,880
It seems the Ministry of Justice

6
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,720
isn't very strict with its staff.

7
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,720
Thanks to you,

8
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,600
I slept really well last night.

9
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,040
How credible are you in your judgment

10
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,600
that the murderer isn't from the Liang family?

11
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Ninety percent.

12
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,120
Go investigate now,

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,320
while your head

14
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,760
is still attached to your neck.

15
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
If you keep making me

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
stay up all night,

17
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
even if I can keep my head,

18
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
I probably won't live long anyway.

19
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
My lord.

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
My lord, my lady,

21
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,960
breakfast is served.

22
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,440
I have no appetite.

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,760
Heavens.

24
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,840
What a mess.

25
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,880
Yan Xing.

26
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Xing.

27
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Chuichui.

28
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
Seriously?

29
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,640
They don't even feed you there?

30
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,320
Dining together with him?

31
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,760
Still alive.

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,360
I'd rather not.

33
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Looks like she's fine.

34
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,560
Let's go.

35
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,600
You'd rather not?

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,240
Really?

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I've heard that you and the White Death

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,480
were very much in love.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,080
That you got along very well,

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,200
and supported each other.

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,160
You even rode a horse together.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,080
I've heard all about it.

43
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,600
Come on, be honest.

44
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,560
It's true about what the saying says,

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
good news doesn't travel far,

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,240
but bad news spreads everywhere.

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Bad news?

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,560
You are now famous

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,720
among the noblewomen

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,040
in the imperial city.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,480
Once,

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,040
a woman pretended to faint

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
and fell into Shen Du's arms.

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,280
She was arrested by the Imperial Guard

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
and charged with

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
offending Chief Shen.

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
That is very him.

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
From then on,

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
all the women

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
would avoid the White Death

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
like the plague.

62
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,040
But he displayed affection and

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,200
was intimate with you on the street!

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,600
I prefer to be less intimate.

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
This is...

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
On your wedding night,

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
there was a fire at Ming Hall.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,160
Her Highness was furious.

69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,240
Several people from the IG

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,199
have been held accountable,

71
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,000
and even Shen Du's salary

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,120
has been cut.

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,520
Really?

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,800
I heard that

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
poor scholar Chen Baiyi

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,000
committed self-immolation

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
in the Ming Hall because

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,120
he failed his exam.

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
Although he's dead,

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,080
his family was supposed to be punished.

81
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,200
But

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,400
the only one left in his family is this

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
nearly sixty-year-old, frail elder

84
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,200
who's almost deaf and blind.

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,080
Her Highness, in her benevolence,

86
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,480
has granted her pardon.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,080
But this old lady

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,480
has been sitting here

89
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,360
in front of the Ministry of Justice

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,880
day and night,

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
demanding justice.

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Think about it,

93
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
who dares to take on

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,480
such a risky case.

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,680
Do you have a death wish?

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
They will kill me either way.

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,520
I only have one life, what else can they do?

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,440
Madam,

99
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,320
please get up.

100
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,640
If there is indeed any injustice,

101
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,200
we will surely find out

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
what really happened.

103
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
Thank you, Lady.

104
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,280
Who was that bold

105
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,800
and took that old lady's case?

106
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
C'mon,

107
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
come forward yourself.

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm in a good mood today.

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,080
I promise to spare your life.

110
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,240
Who took her case?

111
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,760
That Lady Chen outside?

112
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,320
I already took her home.

113
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
You are all dismissed.

114
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400
Let's go, let's go.

115
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,320
How it is y...

116
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
Actually, we should have

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,040
comforted the old lady.

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,160
Otherwise, she would just

119
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,760
keep sitting in front of the

120
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
office everyday.

121
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,880
About the case of Chen Baiyi's

122
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,480
self-immolation,

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,440
I have already...

124
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
The follow-up will now be handled by...

125
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,760
Feng Gui!

126
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
You just keep an eye on the old lady

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,320
and don't let her come again.

128
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,360
I'd rather not.

129
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Chief Clerk Wu,

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,280
I think...

131
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,000
Everyone, gather around.

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,160
The IG has taken over the murder case

133
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,720
of Liang Chenzhong from the Liang family.

134
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,400
No one

135
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
is to intervene again.

136
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,000
The IG

137
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,400
is not a place where

138
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
we should intervene.

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,680
Anyone who disobeys

140
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
will face severe punishment from me.

141
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,120
Yes.

142
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
Get back to your work.

143
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,120
Chief Clerk Wu, I...

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Yan Xing,

145
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,240
Chuichui,

146
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,840
don't you two still have some files

147
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,040
to organize?

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,120
Keep going.

149
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm really...

150
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
Xing,

151
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,520
I just remembered that

152
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,480
weren't you going to have lunch

153
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,840
together with Chief Shen?

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,200
It's getting late.

155
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
There's really no rush

156
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,840
with the files.

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,800
Lunch is more important.

158
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
Lunch is more important.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,520
Let's go.

160
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,840
You should give up your small business.

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,680
and follow me.

162
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,040
Okay.

163
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,200
Thank you.

164
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,520
Madam, I'm sorry.

165
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,720
Tongming Pavilion has a rule of

166
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,920
only admitting male guests

167
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
and does not accept females guests.

168
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
We're not guests.

169
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,640
We're here for official matters.

170
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,520
Then how about

171
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,440
you send a male official instead?

172
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,720
Although I am just a clerk,

173
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,800
but she

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,040
is a distinguished ninth-rank clerk

175
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,920
on record with the Ministry of Justice.

176
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,799
Your obstruction

177
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,640
seems to question

178
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,440
the official selection process

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,200
for officials.

180
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,080
Madam, please don't make things difficult.

181
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,400
If I let you two ladies in

182
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,279
today,

183
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,279
I'm afraid,

184
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,039
I won't be able to

185
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,159
keep my job.

186
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,600
Then how about you

187
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,960
take a closer look?

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,800
Are we female guests

189
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
or male guests?

190
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,920
Male guests.

191
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,680
This way, please.

192
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,680
My poor Zhanxin,

193
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,560
how could she be so unfortunate?

194
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
When she met Liang Chenzhong,

195
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,480
I thought she could

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
marry into a good family.

197
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,840
Who is so ruthless

198
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,080
and killed her?

199
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Madam, our condolences.

200
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,440
Do you still remember

201
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,720
if there was anything

202
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,480
out of the ordinary

203
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,760
before Kuang Zhanxin disappeared,

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,720
or

205
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,840
if she had

206
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,280
any arguments with anyone?

207
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Zhanxin has always been gentle

208
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,560
and got along well with her sisters

209
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
and neighbors.

210
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,280
So before the officials informed you

211
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,720
last night, you didn't know

212
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,080
that Kuang Zhanxin was missing?

213
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,400
She left on the 17th of last month

214
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,120
to go on a trip with Liang Chenzhong.

215
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,280
Liang Chenzhong

216
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,000
has taken her on trips before.

217
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,960
So I thought this time

218
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,800
was just a longer trip.

219
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,920
If there's more questions,

220
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
we'll come back in the future.

221
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,280
Please accept my deepest condolences.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,840
I heard Chen Baiyi not only set himself

223
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,200
on fire but also burned down the Ming Hall.

224
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,840
Thankfully, you kicked him out early.

225
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
In Dacang, it's all about connections.

226
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,920
A nobody from a poor family like him

227
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,480
dreaming of rising to greatness?

228
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
He was simply delusional.

229
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,920
He was lucky that

230
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,800
I let him write for me.

231
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,840
But he's still not content.

232
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,840
These poor scholars

233
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,880
are so ungrateful.

234
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,560
He was just a study companion,

235
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,320
yet he wanted to take the top spot in

236
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
the Hongwen Hall's literary competition?

237
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
How preposterous!

238
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,760
Here, drink!

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,400
Here here.

240
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,120
Xing.

241
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
Xing.

242
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,400
Let's go.

243
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,440
Xing.

244
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,240
Xu Shuai.

245
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,000
Clerk Lu.

246
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,880
Xu Shuai,

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
you're here at Tongming Pavilion on a case?

248
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,240
The very one

249
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,480
your husband took over.

250
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,840
I probably shouldn't call you

251
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,120
Xing anymore,

252
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,960
I should address you as Lady.

253
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,480
Xu Shuai,

254
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,000
just call me Xing

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
as usual.

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,640
Okay.

257
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,560
Then stop calling me

258
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,760
Xu Shuai as well.

259
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,000
You can just call me Shuai.

260
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,040
Okay,

261
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,920
Shuai.

262
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,240
After the death of Kuang Zhanxin

263
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
blazed about,

264
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,640
every family near the

265
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,600
Pingkang music house

266
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,120
is on the edge.

267
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,080
If a daughter

268
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,960
has been out for too long,

269
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,040
they would think that

270
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,000
she's gone missing.

271
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
We already have more than a dozen reports.

272
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,200
Someone else went missing?

273
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,240
No.

274
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,520
There were 17 girls reported missing.

275
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,160
We already found 15 of them.

276
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,520
And the other two

277
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,680
should be fine as well.

278
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,800
But there's another thing.

279
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,160
I was just deciding if

280
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I should report it,

281
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
before I ran into you here.

282
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,800
This document records the missing cases

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,480
of songstresses over the years.

284
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
That's odd.

285
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,360
Although these songstresses

286
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,320
aren't the top performers

287
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,000
in their houses,

288
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,040
they were all well-versed in music,

289
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
excelled in instrumental skills,

290
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
and were especially skilled in pipa.

291
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,080
That's right.

292
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,880
It was too much of a coincidence.

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
That's why I find it odd.

294
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
These are their portraits.

295
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,080
All these women

296
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,720
had the same hairstyle.

297
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Did you notice anything else?

298
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,920
Look,

299
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
despite the differences

300
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,560
in their facial features,

301
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,640
they shared certain common elements,

302
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
especially in their expressions,

303
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
which were remarkably alike.

304
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,080
Yeah.

305
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,680
There is an inexplicable similarity

306
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,000
at first glance.

307
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,640
I intended to turn these

308
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
files over to the Ministry of Justice,

309
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,520
but then I feared it might

310
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,160
be inappropriate to bypass the IG.

311
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,480
Now it seems

312
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,120
best for you to take them.

313
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,560
The White Death

314
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,160
isn't going to kill his wife for this,

315
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,880
right?

316
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,920
I'll excuse myself then.

317
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,640
You left this morning with confident attitude,

318
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
betting against me.

319
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
I thought you were investigating,

320
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,480
turns out you were just chitchatting.

321
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,880
I was discussing the case

322
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,040
with Xu Shuai, who is in charge of

10323
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,080
the Delinquent.

10324
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,840
In charge?

325
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Really?

326
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,120
Xu Shuai was once

327
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,520
a notorious outlaw with a reward of

328
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,480
one hundred thousand taels on his head.

329
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,320
So Xu Shuai

330
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,760
was the legendary thief who

331
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
broke into the palace and

332
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,560
stole the Queen Mother's jade pillow?

333
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,440
Sounds impressive,

334
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,600
but he was still captured, wasn't he?

335
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,680
Even so,

336
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,280
but the Queen Mother valued his talent.

337
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,840
She not only spared him

338
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,440
but also freed him from slavery.

339
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,880
It doesn't matter.

340
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,080
He was captured,

341
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
that means he was incompetent.

342
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,760
I...

343
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
Can you really solve the case

344
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,040
with someone like that?

345
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,800
Of course I can.

346
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm about to win

347
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,840
our bet on the Liang Case.

348
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
All the evidence

349
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,680
points to

350
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,920
this being an ongoing

351
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,880
serial murder case.

352
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,120
Once I find the real murderer,

353
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
the Liang family

354
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,720
will be fully cleared of suspicion.

355
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,360
Chief Shen,

356
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,560
reports from our eyes said that

357
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,200
the main branch of the Liang family

358
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
splashed chicken blood on the second branch,

359
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,920
driving Second Madame further into madness.

360
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,880
And Liang Chenyu went to the

361
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,240
Ministry of Justice and turned himself in.

362
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,200
Moreover,

363
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,880
Prince Ying said she wanted to see you.

364
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,320
Prince Ying

365
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,840
only asked Chief Shen to go in.

366
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,800
Prince Ying.

367
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,480
The imprisonment of Liang Chenyu is not

368
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,760
something Her Highness would wish.

369
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,760
If I'm not wrong,

370
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
Her Highness

371
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,040
didn't ask Chief Shen

372
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,240
to look into that case.

373
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,080
Rather, she asked you to protect the Liangs.

374
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,560
There isn't enough evidence

375
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,200
for a verdict yet.

376
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,200
You have always been meticulous,

377
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
but this time,

378
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,160
you've been reluctant to act by the book.

379
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
Just don't be like your father,

380
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,720
keeping your plans all to yourself.

381
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,280
I don't dare.

382
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,880
Her Highness must be intentionally

383
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
giving Chief Shen a hard time.

384
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,120
The Queen Mother

385
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,239
had made it clear that we should protect

386
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,560
the second branch of the Liang family.

387
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,040
But my lady,

388
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,160
you insisted on digging deeper.

389
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,000
Now, look what's happened,

390
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,320
Liang Chenyu is in prison.

391
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,400
How is Chief Shen supposed to

392
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,360
explain this to the higher-ups?

393
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,040
I'll take full responsibility for the case

394
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,760
and promise a satisfactory

395
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,720
explanation for those above.

396
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
The Queen Mother trusts you,

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
I naturally trust you too.

398
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,320
I only wish that

399
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
you don't let my trust in you down.

400
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,000
I heard that your newly wed wife,

401
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,280
Lady Shen is quite interesting.

402
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,760
I'm very grateful to the Queen Mother

403
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,960
for granting me this marriage.

404
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,080
Chief Shen,

405
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,120
five more pairs of bodies

406
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,160
were just dug up near Ximing Temple,

407
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,680
the cause of death is the same as the others.

408
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
So it seems

409
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,520
this case indeed

410
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,040
has nothing to do with the Liang family.

411
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,640
Along with the two bodies previously found,

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,080
we now have six pairs,

413
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,520
making twelve bodies in total.

414
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,240
The killer's method remained consistent.

415
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
The men had their hearts cut out,

416
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,880
and the women were disfigured.

417
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,000
This is not mud from Ximing Temple.

418
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
These bodies

419
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,080
have been moved

420
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,760
and reburied recently.

421
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,200
Her face is dark purple,

422
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,320
with skin and flesh turned outward,

423
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
but you can still tell

424
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,880
she was a young woman.

425
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,960
Can you determine

426
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,160
the time of death?

427
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,000
These two people

428
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,320
were probably killed last month.

429
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,600
Around the bodies,

430
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,120
there are layers of charcoal and wood ash,

431
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,440
probably to hide the odor.

432
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,320
But what is this peculiar fragrance?

433
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,480
Anything out of the norm?

434
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,240
If my master was here,

435
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,440
he would surely be able to tell

436
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,800
what else is in there.

437
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
From what I see,

438
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,680
you've already inherited

439
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,760
your master's legacy.

440
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,160
Maybe even better that

441
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,360
the legendary detective, Pan Chi.

442
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,920
Not even close!

443
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
After his retirement, my master has been

444
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,480
traveling the world

445
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,320
and probably doesn't even remember that

446
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,440
I was his apprentice.

447
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,440
These are

448
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,760
the earliest two bodies we've found.

449
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,520
The decomposition is the most severe.

450
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,960
It's very hard to pinpoint

451
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,880
the exact time of death.

452
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
It should be

453
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,400
between four to six years ago.

454
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,280
If it's the same murderer,

455
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,480
he's truly ruthless,

456
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,040
cutting open the chest, removing the heart.

457
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,920
It's probably

458
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,160
a strong man,

459
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,720
maybe a butcher.

460
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,400
I think,

461
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
the suspect is most likely

462
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,640
a woman.

463
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,160
Why?

464
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,400
The wounds on the female victims' faces,

465
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,200
their placement,

466
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,720
length,

467
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,520
and depth

468
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
are almost exactly the same.

469
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,400
And the force used with the knife

470
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,160
doesn't seem to be that of a man.

471
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
If the killer was a woman,

472
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
she killed 12 people

473
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,760
these years.

474
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,320
These male victims

475
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,400
were not old or weak.

476
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,560
They were in their prime when they died.

477
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,480
How were they overpowered by a woman?

478
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,920
Shuai,

479
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,640
if we think something is impossible

480
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,840
simply because we haven't seen it before,

481
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
many strange cases in this world

482
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,880
would've never been solved.

483
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,720
Let's go.

484
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,360
What...

485
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,800
What are you doing?

486
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,960
Prince Ying has already ordered that

487
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,920
the cases of Ximing Temple

488
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,000
and the Liang family

489
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
be merged

490
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,680
and handled solely by the IG.

491
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
The officials of the Ministry of Justice

492
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,520
can't no longer intervene.

493
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,480
Fine.

494
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll take you to a place first.

495
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,120
Where?

496
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,080
You...

497
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,720
Her sleeves are filled

498
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,280
with the fragrance of white sandalwood.

499
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,680
A silk garment with embroidered patterns,

500
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,400
a jade hairpin,

501
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,000
and a peony-patterned white silk fan.

502
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,800
Instead of dawdling here,

503
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,080
why don't you try to figure out

504
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
how to keep your head?

505
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,600
Where are we going exactly?

506
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,200
The Ministry of Justice.

507
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,680
Let me off.

508
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,240
We're near the Ministry of Justice.

509
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,640
I can walk there myself.

510
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,320
The real killer is still on the loose.

511
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,920
Liang Chenyu is still in prison.

512
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
If anything happens to him,

513
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
you'll go keep him company in hell.

514
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,120
Chief Shen,

515
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,840
I have never lost

516
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,880
a bet before.

517
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
Chief Shen, what brings you here to

518
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,800
the Ministry of Justice today?

519
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,760
I can't come here?

520
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,160
Chief Shen, what are you saying?

521
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,920
Of course you're welcome to come here.

522
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
I'm here to ask you for someone

523
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
to help out at the IG.

524
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,240
Chief Shen, you want to make a transfer?

525
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
That's easy.

526
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,400
Who do you want to transfer,

527
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,960
I'll go arrange it right away.

528
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,360
Her.

529
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,200
The Ximing Temple case has been

530
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,040
fully handed over to the IG.

531
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,800
The Ministry of Justice should step back.

532
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,960
Yes.

533
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,760
Chief Shen,

534
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,320
I still have many case files

535
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,200
to record.

536
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,040
I can't be transferred to the IG now.

537
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,760
Clerk Yan, what are you talking about?

538
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,160
Just give your case files

539
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,560
to Clerk Lu.

540
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,120
Go ahead, go with Chief Shen.

541
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
If Clerk Yan doesn't come,

542
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,520
this case is closed.

543
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,640
Chief Clerk Wu,

544
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,480
take those bodies outside the city,

545
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
find a place and bury them.

546
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,040
No.

547
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,600
Fine, I'm coming.

548
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,320
Xing.

549
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,360
These were found at Chen Baiyi's home.

550
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,920
There are some essays he wrote.

551
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,840
I already read them.

552
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,560
The writing was remarkable.

553
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Thank you for your

554
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
hard work these days.

555
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,760
It's nothing.

556
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,480
Just take me to the Furong Theater.

557
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
Okay!

558
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,520
Be careful.

559
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,760
Chief Shen,

560
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,560
the preliminary forensic report is ready.

561
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
Jinglin, should any officials

562
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,760
from the Ministry of Justice be

563
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,320
found investigating this case privately,

564
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
charge them with collusion.

565
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,280
Yes.

566
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,520
Then I'll have to thank you

567
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,400
for transferring me,

568
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,920
allowing me

569
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,360
to continue working on this case.

570
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,960
I will give it my all

571
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,000
and solve it as soon as possible.

572
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,360
That's good.

573
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,480
Now that I'm here,

574
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,320
I am

575
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,800
a part of the IG.

576
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,760
I'll have to follow the rules

577
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,040
of the IG.

578
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm only a clerk,

579
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,160
how can I ride a horse

580
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,760
together with the Chief?

581
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,240
I am not skilled in horseback riding,

582
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,880
but I trust that Jinglin

583
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,840
will surely not

584
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,880
just leave me behind,

585
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,640
right?

586
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,560
Me?

587
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,600
Then Jinglin,

588
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,920
today you'll have to make do

589
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,120
and ride together with me.

590
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,160
My lady, if you wish to ride a horse,

591
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,680
you should do so with the Chief.

592
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
I'll...

593
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll lead your horse.

594
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,680
How can that be?

595
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,400
Let's ride together.

596
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
In work, gender does not matter.

597
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,280
Jinglin,

598
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,000
just think of me

599
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,400
as a regular colleague.

600
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,160
My lady, I'll just lead the horse.

601
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,960
How much longer are you going to chitchat?

602
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,560
If you continue this,

603
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,320
you'll be fined half a year's salary.

604
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,120
I... I...

605
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,280
Chief Shen.

606
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,760
These

607
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,640
are taken from

608
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,080
the earliest pair of victims.

609
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,720
Made in

610
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,440
the first year of the Shengli era.

611
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,720
This was on the

612
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,160
earliest male victim.

613
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,680
The first crime

614
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,640
most likely took place six years ago.

615
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,320
Why's that?

616
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,320
The method of killing

617
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,600
has remained consistent.

618
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
The timing of the crime

619
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,120
likely follows a pattern as well.

620
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,040
Even a small mistake

621
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,280
can lead to a major mistake.

622
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,960
If we get it wrong,

623
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
it would make it even harder

624
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,480
to find the killer.

625
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,080
The Treasure Double Fish Pattern.

626
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,760
Jinxiu Silk Workshop.

627
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,880
The Treasure Double Fish Pattern

628
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
was a signature design created by

629
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,840
the renowned Jinxiu Silk Workshop.

630
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
It was a nationwide sensation.

631
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,080
Jinxiu Silk Workshop was the premier

632
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,160
silk provider to the palace,

633
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,240
delivering on the first day of each month.

634
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,520
However, in June of the third year of the Shengli era,

635
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,640
the workshop was charged with defiance

636
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,200
for making excessive garments

637
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,400
for Princess Runing.

638
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,040
That's why since then,

639
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,200
no one in the imperial city

640
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,240
dared to wear their fabrics anymore.

641
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,920
Therefore, this man

642
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,680
must have been killed

643
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,440
before the Jinxiu Silk incident.

644
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,800
The gold plaque was made the first year

645
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,480
of the Shengli era, so it's possible that

646
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,560
he was killed that year.

647
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,320
Impossible.

648
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,280
The Treasure Double Fish Pattern

649
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,360
was a spring garment design by Jinxiu workshop

650
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,160
in the third year of the Shengli era.

651
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,320
Sold only from February to April that year.

652
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,280
You remember it this clearly?

653
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,600
There's a dossier

654
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
from the Jinxiu Workshop at the Archive,

655
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
with a volume of

656
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,560
illustrated patterns

657
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,480
covering ten years.

658
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,680
Jinglin,

659
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,680
go compare them.

660
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,760
Make sure it's right.

661
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,480
Yes.

662
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,520
My lady,

663
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,120
the Archive is filled with

664
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,680
valuable items and rare books.

665
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,640
Please do not wander around.

666
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,200
Or touch anything unnecessarily.

667
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,680
I got it, I got it.

668
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,320
We'll be faster if we split up.

669
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,280
You go over there.

670
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,240
Please be careful.

671
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,000
Compilation of Essays from Hongwen Hall.

672
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,520
Be quick!

673
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,520
Quickly, quickly.

674
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,360
Don't drop it.

675
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,680
How are you so careless?

676
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,840
Wait, wait, wait.

677
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,400
Hey,

678
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,680
why are you here?

679
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,600
Weren't you transferred

680
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,680
to the IG?

681
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
I need to see Chief Clerk Wu.

682
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,800
There's been progress in the Chen Baiyi case.

683
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,400
The Chief Clerk has instructed that

684
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,680
no one is to bring up the

685
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,480
Chen Baiyi case again.

686
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,360
Whoever does

687
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,560
will lose their jobs.

688
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,760
There is indeed something behind it.

689
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,080
I need to see Chief Clerk Wu.

690
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Wait a moment.

691
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,280
Didn't you see that?

692
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,640
The whole Ministry of Justice

693
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,800
has been running around all day

694
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,000
because of a children's rhyme.

695
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,040
Who has the time to

696
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,760
look into the self-immolation case,

697
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,400
you see?

698
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,320
What children's rhyme?

699
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,400
You didn't know?

700
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,720
This could get you killed.

701
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,840
It's spread to

702
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,800
everyone in the city.

703
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,800
Who knows who will be held accountable

704
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,760
this time.

705
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,920
Slow down, slow down.

706
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,880
Watch the stairs.

707
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,160
People are heartless,

708
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,600
Buddha eats hearts,

709
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,400
chaos rises beneath the Emperor's feet,

710
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,240
Buddha eats hearts to hide sins.

711
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,640
The Dark Demon is here!

712
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,560
Kid,

713
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,640
did you know what you just said

714
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
was an act of treachery?

715
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,840
How do you think

716
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,480
you should be punished?

717
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,680
Do you want to try this new invention,

718
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,640
'I invite you into the jar'.

719
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,600
Later,

720
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,000
we'll put the jar on the fire,

721
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,400
you'll have more fun.

722
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,480
Guards.

723
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,960
No, My Lord, no!

724
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,680
No, My Lord, no!

725
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,640
No, My Lord!

726
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,280
My Lord, please!

727
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,840
My Lord, he's just a child.

728
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,120
Please let him go, My Lord.

729
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,760
If such treacherous rumors

730
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,360
are spread freely,

731
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,720
won't the imperial city

732
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,640
become

733
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,160
a lawless place?

734
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,880
No, My Lord, please.

735
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
If you won't discipline your kid,

736
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,360
then I'll do it for you.

737
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,840
Mercy, My Lord.

738
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,880
Make way for the royal carriage.

739
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,760
Prince Ying.

740
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,920
She looks familiar.

741
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,640
What's going on? What's with the noise?

742
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,320
Your Majesty,

743
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,640
please save my child!

744
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,560
Please save my child!

745
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,120
Your Majesty,

746
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,320
I came to patrol the streets today and

747
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,720
overheard a child's treacherous remarks.

748
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,800
What he said was outrageous.

749
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,200
That's why I apprehended him.

750
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,240
I apologize for disturbing Your Majesty.

751
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,240
I see.

752
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,480
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

753
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,120
My child's words were unfiltered.

754
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,440
I will make sure

755
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,520
he is properly disciplined.

756
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

757
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,720
It is the parents' responsibility

758
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,800
if a child is not taught properly.

759
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,640
You're also at fault.

760
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,600
Chancellor Lai,

761
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,960
everyone makes mistakes.

762
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,160
Moreover,

763
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,280
this is just a young child.

764
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,480
Chancellor, you're known for your wisdom.

765
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,840
Surely, it is not worth tarnish

766
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,080
your reputation for a child.

767
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,680
That being said.

768
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Since I met this child today,

769
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,760
it must

770
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,600
be a sign of destiny.

771
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,520
Chancellor Lai,

772
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,920
could you spare this child

773
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,080
for my sake?

774
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,560
Since Your Majesty has spoken,

775
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,320
of course I'll let him go.

776
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,320
Let him go.

777
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

778
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,480
As long as the child is fine.

779
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,320
Thank you, My lord.

780
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,040
Go now.

781
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,880
-Thank you, Your Majesty. -Thank you, Your Majesty.

782
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,080
Her Majesty

783
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
is truly kind!

784
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,680
Her Majesty is truly forgiving

785
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
and merciful.

786
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,760
Farewell, Your Majesty.

787
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,320
Twenty strokes of punishment for you.

788
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes.

789
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,160
Who is that woman?

790
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,280
What's going on?

791
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,880
Lai Luozhi reported to the court

792
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,240
that Chief has failed the investigation.

793
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,359
Her Highness has issued a decree

794
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,640
to take Chief Shen away.

795
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,520
You two, keep watch at the entrance.

796
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,400
If there's any news about Chief Shen,

797
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,080
report immediately.

798
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,720
Yes.

799
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,120
You can't go in.

800
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,319
Chief Shen has instructed that

801
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:47,799
no one is allowed to

802
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,000
approach the office without permission.

803
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,720
Anyone who disobeys...

804
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,680
You want to go in by force?

805
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,160
Then

806
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,359
you'll have to step over me.

807
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Don't look around.

808
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,560
Don't force me to take actions.

809
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,680
Stop looking around,

810
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,600
or I'll kill myself.

811
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,160
If you want Chief Shen

812
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,720
to die,

813
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:17,720
then go ahead.

814
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,640
Grind the ink.

815
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,320
Grind the ink!

816
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,800
Hopefully, there's still time to

817
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,840
submit the booklet.

818
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,000
The handwriting is identical

819
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,040
to Chief Shen's.

820
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,040
Are you sure

821
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,680
you can save Chief Shen

822
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,480
this way?

823
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,280
Maybe he won't come out unscathed,

824
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,760
but I have to at least try.

825
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,520
Maybe he can avoid severe punishment.

826
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,280
What are you waiting for?

827
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,320
Go now.

828
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll wait here.

829
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,200
Don't look around.

830
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,240
Your Majesty,

831
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
the IG has taken over the case for days

832
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
yet it remains unsolved.

833
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,200
Now rumors are spreading that

834
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,240
the court's officials are ineffectual,

835
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,400
and some even speculate that the Emperor

836
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
is intentionally favoring the Liangs and

837
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,520
it can damage Your Majesty's reputation.

838
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,320
I respectfully urge Your Majesty to

839
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,040
transfer the case to Imperial Inspectorate.

840
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,920
What you have said

841
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,960
is exactly what worries me.

842
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Shen Du from the IG.

843
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,320
Shen Du, of the IG,

844
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,760
greets Your Majesty.

845
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,280
Long live Your Majesty.

846
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,280
Shen Du,

847
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,480
the case of the Liang family

848
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,400
remains yet unsolved,

849
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,520
do you have an explanation

850
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,600
for me?

851
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Your Majesty,

852
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,880
the Liang murder is not an isolated case

853
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,120
but is connected with several bodies

854
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,800
found recently at Ximing Temple,

855
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,240
all linked to the same murderer.

856
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,680
The IG has been working diligently to

857
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,120
merge the cases based on the evidence.

858
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,080
This case involves several

859
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,320
high-ranking court officials,

860
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,920
and Ximing Temple is a place of Buddhism.

861
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,840
Remaining unresolved, it has led to the

862
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,120
spread of a children's rhyme in the city,

863
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
with offensive content.

864
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,160
Tell me what it says.

865
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,480
If I may be so bold,

866
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,920
I will recite this rhyme to

867
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,920
Your Majesty.

868
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,680
"People are heartless,"

869
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,560
"Buddha eats hearts,"

870
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,560
"chaos rises beneath the Emperor's feet,"

871
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,760
"Buddha eats hearts to hide sins."

872
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,320
This is outrageous!

873
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
Your Majesty, do not be angered.

874
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,200
I think,

875
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,600
the reason this rhyme has spread

876
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,760
is due to the unresolved nature of the

877
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,680
Ximing Temple murder case.

878
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,840
If the IG still can't find the culprit,

879
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,520
they might as well

880
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,720
hold a ritual to

881
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,560
drive away evil spirits.

882
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,680
Your Majesty,

883
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
you don't need to pay attention

884
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,240
to these superstitious rumors.

885
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,800
Chief Shen,

886
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,640
did you forget this?

887
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,280
The guards came abruptly to take me,

888
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,360
when I was just sorting through some details,

889
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,160
intending to present them to Your Majesty.

890
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,080
"Only with the Buddha's heart can the world remain peaceful,

891
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,760
and wicked thoughts be gone forever.

892
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,480
Uncover the truth and clear the grievances,

893
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,200
seeing clearly brings peace to the realm."

894
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,760
Okay.

895
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,080
Since you have

896
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,240
discovered various clues

897
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,880
connecting the Liang family

898
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
and Ximing Temple,

899
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,720
just move faster with the investigation.

900
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,800
I accept your order.

901
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,840
Lord Shen,

902
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,600
you also mentioned in the booklet that

903
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,680
the self-immolation has hidden motives.

904
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,920
The person

905
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,560
did not do it to vent frustration

906
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,680
but rather to express their resolve to me

907
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,080
with their death.

908
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Is that true?

909
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
I'm looking into it.

910
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,640
I'll report soon.

911
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,320
Your Majesty.

912
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,960
Okay, enough.

913
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,840
Both of you

914
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,120
are my trusted aides,

915
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,760
each with your own strengths.

916
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,040
Okay then.

917
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,640
That's it for today.

918
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,240
Go back now.

919
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,000
Shen Du,

920
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
please wait.

921
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,680
There is another matter

922
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,960
I need you to attend to right away.

923
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,360
I accept your order.

924
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Chief Shen.

925
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,000
You were calm and eloquent

926
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,120
in front of Her Highness

927
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,520
today.

928
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,240
It was truly impressive.

929
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,640
Your praise is too kind, Chancellor Lai.

930
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,880
I was merely telling the truth.

931
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,920
People say that

932
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
the IG

933
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,120
is like Her Highness's eyes.

934
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,720
It's better if the eyes

935
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
don't look into the wrong direction.

936
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,760
The IG is just doing their job

937
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,040
within their jurisdiction,

938
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,640
unlike the Imperial Inspectorate,

939
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,800
targeting everyone in sight.

940
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,440
If it were someone else,

941
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,240
they might find themselves overwhelmed.

942
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,600
Then I sincerely wish you

943
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,480
can solve the case soon.

944
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,520
There are many who

945
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,040
are waiting to make their move.
