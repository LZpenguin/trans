1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:15,140
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:53,220
Melody of Golden Age EP20

3
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Let me take it.

4
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,560
You're quite perceptive.

5
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,040
Let's take a look at that.

6
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,800
It's really fascinating.

7
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,760
They have fortune sticks here.

8
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
Let's draw a fortune stick.

9
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
Steer clear of the supernatural.

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,760
You're already at the Mingsheng Temple,

11
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
so take your foot out of your mouth.

12
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,160
Let's go.

13
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,120
24.

14
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,760
Try it.

15
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,040
Me?

16
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,320
It's 24 again.

17
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,160
That's not right.

18
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,080
I must have inserted it incorrectly.

19
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,840
One more time.

20
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,520
Another 24!

21
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,440
Emm...

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Alright.

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
Since we got multiple 24s,

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,280
let's see what

25
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,680
24 reveals.

26
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,160
Over there.

27
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
24...

28
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,400
In the past life, there was a connection.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,680
And now, the fortune has come.

30
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,120
What does this mean?

31
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,200
How come there isn't anyone here

32
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,920
to interpret the fortune?

33
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
This isn't right.

34
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,560
This one must be ineffective.

35
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
I think it's quite accurate.

36
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,800
"Steer clear of the supernatural."

37
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
Fate.

38
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
Isn't this quite accurate?

39
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,520
Chui!

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Chui!

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,720
Are you interested in me?

42
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,680
Ignore her nonsense!

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Mr. Xu,

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,520
In my heart,

45
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,120
you truly are different from the others.

46
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
That's because

47
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
you've never disrespected women

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,600
in law enforcement

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,040
like the rest of the officials.

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,440
I've come to

51
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
see you

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
as a big brother

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,560
because of your

54
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,720
sincere assistance.

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,000
But it's purely out of respect,

56
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
with absolutely no other intentions.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
I knew it!

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,720
Good, that's good!

59
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
You see,

60
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,400
if

61
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
you don't mind, and are

62
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,920
willing to recognize me as a brother,

63
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,160
then I would be genuinely delighted!

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Brother!

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,640
Good, my sister!

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,360
Since that's settled,

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,200
let's make it official today

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,720
in front of the

69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,880
Mingsheng Temple.

70
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
From now on,

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,440
we'll be sworn siblings.

72
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,400
You should have this command token.

73
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,040
Holding this token

74
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,120
gives you authority over all the Delinquent

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
in the domains you traverse.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,400
This is unthinkable.

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,360
This is your token

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
as the Chief Inspector.

79
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
I wield authority

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
over all the Delinquent in the realm,

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
and it's not due to this piece of iron.

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,080
Here, take it.

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,960
No, I can't accept this.

84
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,120
It's fine, just take it.

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,800
In times of peril,

86
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,360
it might save your life.

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
I really appreciate it.

88
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,160
That's more like it!

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,400
Now, I'll take my leave.

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,640
Alright, my sister.

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
You're not even considering Chief Xu?

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,320
Yun Que, you should

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
learn some good qualities from Chui,

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
not just the eccentric ones.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
You're quite strange.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,560
It's understandable that you are not

97
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,520
interested in The White Death.

98
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,760
Chief Xu is chivalrous and bold,

99
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
full of passion and heroism.

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,080
Shouldn't he be the hero

101
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,280
in every woman's dreams?

102
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
How come you are not attracted to him?

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Yan Xing,

104
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,000
do you have a

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
screw loose?

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,160
What the...

107
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,920
The way you are acting now

108
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,560
seems just like

109
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
when you criticized me

110
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,560
for not liking Shen Du.

111
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,520
Could it be

112
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,000
that you have feelings for Chief Xu?

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Is there a problem with that?

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
He once saved my life.

115
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,880
Besides,

116
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
he is so manly.

117
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,320
He faces his doubts head-on,

118
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
asking directly and honestly,

119
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,640
without a trace of jealousy or suspicion,

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
in stark contrast to men who

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,480
keep their feelings to themselves, giving

122
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,560
the impression they're always scheming.

123
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
Your preferences change

124
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,840
rather fast.

125
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,120
Anyway,

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
Chief Xu is my ideal partner,

127
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,960
handsome and charming.

128
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,560
Fortunately, you're not competing with me,

129
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
so I don't have to share

130
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,720
the same husband with you anymore.

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,520
We shouldn't have to share anyway.

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,760
I've made my decision.

133
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,520
What's that?

134
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,840
I'm leaving the Shen residence.

135
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,520
I've had enough of that

136
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,680
moody The White Death.

137
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,000
I want to join forces with Chief Xu

138
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,400
and become a chivalrous

139
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
the female Delinquent.

140
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,360
Wonderful!

141
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,440
I fully support you.

142
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,280
If Chief Xu doesn't take you in, I'll join

143
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,200
you in a silent protest at his door.

144
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,800
Long live the sisterhood!

145
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
Girls, huh?

146
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Where's Jiang Langxing?

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
He's too uptight.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,640
Too dull for me.

149
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,600
I shook him off on the way.

150
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,800
This serpent lady is breathtaking.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So gorgeous!

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
Why are there so many people here?

153
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
It's not even the main hall.

154
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,640
Xing?

155
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,360
Lady Lu?

156
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you doing in here?

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,080
Pan?

158
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,080
Lu Chuichui.

159
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
How many are there on your list?

160
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
How many people did you plan to bring?

161
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
I didn't invite him.

162
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
What's the issue?

163
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,000
Shouldn't I be here?

164
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,640
This place is so lively!

165
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm Pan Chi, alright?

166
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,760
Joining the fun is in my blood.

167
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,880
Are you also here for the serpent lady?

168
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,280
- Serpent lady? - Serpent lady?

169
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,800
Pan, are you Alright?

170
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm fine.

171
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,999
Fine...

172
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,400
Stop hiding!

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,680
I saw you already!

174
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,480
My lady,

175
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,280
I...

176
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Jing Lin?

177
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,080
Why are you here?

178
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
I...

179
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,480
I...

180
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,920
I'm here to watch over my lady

181
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,000
on Lord Shen's behalf,

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
in case someone has ulterior motives.

183
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,600
Who are you referring to?

184
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,280
You're asking who I'm referring to?

185
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,240
It's the very person you have in mind!

186
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,880
Shen Du sent you to follow me, right?

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,640
Is he alright?

188
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
He is not.

189
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,680
He is definitely not alright.

190
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,480
My lady,

191
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,480
during your absence from the residence,

192
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,480
Lord Shen has

193
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,560
lost all appetite for tea

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,760
and food,

195
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,800
and has visibly

196
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
slimmed down.

197
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,600
She's only been away for a short while.

198
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,120
How could he have lost weight?

199
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,400
Not only has he lost weight,

200
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,600
he's also looking quite worn out.

201
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,000
Every night,

202
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,920
Lord Shen calls out my lady's name.

203
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,840
Like this:

204
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,080
Xing, my love,

205
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,440
please don't leave me!

206
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,600
My sweetest Xing!

207
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,760
He

208
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,480
really said that?

209
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm surprised that he is so atta...

210
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
If so,

211
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,080
I'll go back with you

212
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,400
to ensure he doesn't get any aftereffects

213
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,440
and end up blaming me.

214
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Xing,

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
are you leaving already?

216
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,320
Shen Du is bearing wounds,

217
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,800
so I have to return and take care of him.

218
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,920
Stubborn toots!

219
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm off.

220
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,280
Alright, alright, let her be.

221
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,200
She's such a buzzkill.

222
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,120
Let's watch the serpent lady.

223
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,880
Serpent lady!

224
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,360
Excuse me.

225
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,680
Excuse me, coming through!

226
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,120
Excuse me.

227
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,560
Oh my!

228
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
She's truly a serpent lady.

229
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,080
So breathtaking!

230
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,120
She gave up

231
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,720
the chance to ascend to immortality

232
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,960
and came to the mortal realm

233
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
to share the elixir she has cultivated

234
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,440
for a thousand years.

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Elixir?

236
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,560
This elixir is called "Elixir of Youth."

237
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
A woman who consumes this elixir

238
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,120
will boast a complexion fair as snow,

239
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,480
and her natural allure will be enhanced.

240
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,200
Those unwed may attract a suitor of high esteem.

241
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,280
Men, it makes a splendid offering

242
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,240
for the one you hold dear,

243
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,720
May the serpent lady bless all lovers

244
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,200
in the world with

245
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,560
everlasting affection.

246
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,120
Please grant us the Elixirs of Youth.

247
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

248
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,320
the Elixir of Youth is invaluable

249
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,720
and in scarce supply.

250
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,040
If anyone wishes to obtain it, they can

251
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,800
exchange ten gold bars for a bottle.

252
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
- Boast a complexion fair as snow? - That's quite a steep price!

253
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,840
Natural allure will be enhanced?

254
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,800
Do you think the

255
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
high price is justified?

256
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,960
That makes sense.

257
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,040
Let's get it!

258
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Alright, alright.

259
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,160
Today, they have been completely sold out.

260
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,960
It's all gone?

261
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,000
I've been here three times already

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,080
and still haven't managed to get any.

263
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,760
If anyone wants to get it,

264
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,080
come back in three days.

265
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,640
Let's return another day.

266
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,440
Let's go.

267
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,440
How are you feeling today?

268
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,920
Are your wounds still bothering you?

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,800
No.

270
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,920
Why do you look

271
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,560
so gloomy?

272
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,200
Do I?

273
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,000
My lady, how come

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,080
you seem quite happy.

275
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
Have you found a good match?

276
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,000
Didn't Jing Lin mention...

277
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,560
I see you're doing quite well.

278
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,000
Indeed.

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,760
With my lady away,

280
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
I relish the tranquility,

281
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,840
and, naturally, I'm doing splendidly.

282
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,000
So you went to meet Xu Xiangren?

283
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,360
That's right.

284
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,080
I just happened to run into him. What?

285
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,480
You just happened to run into him, huh?

286
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,840
At that temple, where people seek marriage.

287
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,240
He even gave the token of

288
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,040
the Chief Inspector to you?

289
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,320
He gave me this as a gesture

290
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,240
of being my sworn brother.

291
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Don't take it the wrong way.

292
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,000
I...

293
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm not taking it in any way.

294
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,960
Yeah.

295
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,560
You don't have anything to worry about.

296
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,640
Once you're healed,

297
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,560
you should also visit the Mingsheng Temple

298
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,280
and pay your respects.

299
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,440
It's quite effective.

300
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,520
Who knows,

301
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,240
you might actually get what you wish for.

302
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
What could I possibly wish for?

303
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Crying and whining.

304
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,080
What are you making a fuss about?

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
Auntie!

306
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,200
My belly really hurts!

307
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,840
Can I get down for a moment?

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
You shouldn't have

309
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,640
eaten anything at night.

310
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,600
Take it easy.

311
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,960
Don't get that costume dirty.

312
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Thank you, auntie.

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,040
Bao, come out for a moment.

314
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
Stand at the door and keep watch.

315
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,720
OK.

316
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,840
Tricks and deception.

317
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Some immortal serpent lady you got here.

318
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,760
It's evidently a hub for

319
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
human traffickers dealing in girls.

320
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,440
Miss,

321
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,360
farewell!

322
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,240
You...

323
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,200
I don't have anything

324
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,720
of value on me.

325
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,800
Perhaps this is

326
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,520
the only thing worth something.

327
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,520
Please take it.

328
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,040
Here.

329
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,120
You should have it.

330
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,200
How do you have a fire moth jade?

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,240
Are you from the Fire Moth Sect?

332
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,480
This isn't mine.

333
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,560
My belongings

334
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,040
were all taken when I was sold

335
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,200
in Gannan.

336
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,040
This is from the one who abducted me.

337
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,120
So you were

338
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,720
sold in Gannan?

339
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,000
Is the person

340
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,800
who sold you from Xiang'an?

341
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,880
Based on his accent,

342
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,360
he should be a Gannan local.

343
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
The Fire Moth Sect rose in Xiang'an,

344
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,320
and it only took a short time.

345
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,720
How did it spread

346
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,080
to Gannan so fast?

347
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,040
No, wait.

348
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,080
When were you sold?

349
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,600
I can't recall the exact time,

350
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,440
but it's been a few months at least.

351
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,640
Miss,

352
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,200
do you know the way home?

353
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,880
I have a way to travel to

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,880
the Western Regions and the Jinwu Tribe.

355
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,840
Let's do this:

356
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,720
Just follow me,

357
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,080
and I'll lead you to

358
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,560
the trading post to the Western Regions.

359
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
Really?

360
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,240
Let's go.

361
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,600
Are you able to attend the assembly?

362
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,360
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

363
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,400
It's not wise to move around too much.

364
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,640
It's just assembly as usual.

365
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,320
It's not like I'm going after a murder.

366
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,640
If I don't show up again, people will

367
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,960
think you're going to be a widow.

368
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Then be careful.

369
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
These days,

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,919
- Than... - Lord Shen!

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,439
Greetings, Lord Shen, my lady.

372
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,919
There's an oral edict from the palace.

373
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,919
Her Majesty

374
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,320
requests my lady's presence at the palace.

375
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,360
Greetings, Great Grandmother.

376
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,960
Yan Xing, a clerk from the Ministry of Justice

377
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,440
pays respects to Your Majesty.

378
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,360
It's just us here.

379
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,360
No need for such formality.

380
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Please rise.

381
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,840
Regarding the Chen Huo'e case,

382
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,160
Shen Du's made significant contributions.

383
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,680
I haven't yet decided

384
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,360
how to reward him.

385
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,840
What do you think?

386
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,400
How should I reward him this time?

387
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,800
Whether we receive reward or face wrath,

388
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,240
they all stem from the sovereign's grace.

389
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,760
We as humble servants, are deeply grateful

390
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,800
regardless of Your Majesty' decision.

391
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
Though you hold no official rank,

392
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,880
you've certainly mastered the art

393
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
of diplomatic pleasantries, young lady.

394
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,040
I, your humble subject, tremble with fear.

395
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,600
Your Majesty,

396
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,520
why must you make it difficult for her?

397
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,920
Lord Shen has already

398
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,440
taken command of the Imperial Guard.

399
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
He's also in charge of the capital garrison.

400
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,480
He cannot be

401
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,960
promoted any further.

402
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,080
It'd be better to reward clerk Yan

403
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,440
with some tangible benefits.

404
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
You seem willing to protect her.

405
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,840
I just feel

406
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
that clerk Yan

407
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,480
is determined to become a female official,

408
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,640
which reminds me of how I was in my youth.

409
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,960
So I feel a connection with her.

410
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
If so,

411
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,160
then promote clerk Yan Xing

412
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,400
to the position of scribe.

413
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,360
Your Majesty,

414
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,120
I also intended to participate in

415
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,800
this year's female official examination.

416
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,840
I want to rely on my own abilities

417
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
to reach the position of scribe.

418
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,680
You should apparently rely on

419
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,120
your own abilities for the examination.

420
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,440
The female officials' promotion or

421
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
demotion are based on merit.

422
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,240
Her Majesty granting you

423
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,960
the title of scribe is intended

424
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,960
to present you with a greater challenge.

425
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,280
If you take the exam as a clerk and fail,

426
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
you will still remain a clerk.

427
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,360
If you pass, you will become a scribe.

428
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,280
However, if you

429
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
take the exam as a scribe,

430
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,480
the risks will be much greater.

431
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,720
If you fail, you will lose

432
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,560
your chance of serving in a public position.

433
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,200
But if you pass the exam, you will have

434
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,760
the chance to be promoted to archivist.

435
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,480
Are you willing to take that risk?

436
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,680
Yan Xing vows to honor the trust of

437
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,160
Your Majesty and Lady Xu.

438
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,040
Good.

439
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,280
Lady Xu has made a wise choice.

440
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
Scribe, Lady Yan,

441
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,720
then I

442
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,760
look forward to seeing your results.

443
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,280
You and Shen Du truly share a deep bond,

444
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
which is quite enviable.

445
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,440
Actually, he...

446
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,160
Actually, he has already sent me a message

447
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,720
to ensure that I look out for you.

448
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,680
He worries that you might be nervous

449
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,760
and make mistakes during the meeting.

450
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,200
He

451
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,320
might be concerned that I

452
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,720
would embarrass the Shen Family.

453
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,720
Is that so?

454
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,440
I don't see it that way.

455
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,560
I have known him for years,

456
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
and I have never seen him

457
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,720
care so deeply for anyone.

458
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,560
Lady Xu,

459
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,800
thank you for your support today,

460
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
and for sharing all this with me.

461
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,560
I'm truly humbled.

462
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,960
Thank you for putting your trust in me.

463
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,720
On that day,

464
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,640
when Jing Lin handed me the memo

465
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,600
regarding the Chen Huo'e case,

466
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,600
I immediately understood your intentions.

467
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,800
Although we don't interact much,

468
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,800
you entrusted your own life

469
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,320
to me.

470
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,760
I trust you

471
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,680
and I'm sure that Shen Du

472
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,120
sees you accurately.

473
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,360
I do believe

474
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,960
my wife is wonderful.

475
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,640
Let's take this one.

476
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,800
The design is simple.

477
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,680
It suits you perfectly.

478
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,320
Although in your heart,

479
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
there's still someone you can't let go of,

480
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,320
you have treated me sincerely.

481
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,920
Since the three-month period isn't up yet,

482
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,480
I should cherish

483
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,680
every remaining day.

484
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

485
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,000
Very well.

486
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,480
I heard that Yan Caiwei and Mr. Han

487
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,600
are about to get married.

488
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
I summoned you here to congratulate you.

489
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,920
Gratitude, Your Highness.

490
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
What are you thanking me for?

491
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
You are the one getting married;

492
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,440
what does it have to do with me?

493
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,280
You,

494
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,560
have high aspirations.

495
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
I heard that initially, you

496
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,520
didn't even take notice of Lord Shen.

497
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,160
What a shame.

498
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,720
Your judgment really isn't that great.

499
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,440
Today, if you drink a cup of tea from me,

500
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,600
then I will wish you

501
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
all your wishes come true.

502
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,840
If the wedding doesn't happen,

503
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,600
don't blame me for causing trouble.

504
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,920
Excuse me.

505
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,920
Are you alright?

506
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,200
I'm fine.

507
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,560
My lady, my lady!

508
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,080
My lord asked you to go home.

509
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,400
Your sister is in trouble.

510
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,640
Mr. Han,

511
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,720
let me take a look at her.

512
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,600
What is this?

513
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,840
Her condition is getting worse!

514
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,800
Please, save Caiwei!

515
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,440
Xing,

516
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,920
during the day,

517
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,280
we called the Healer from the palace

518
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,400
to come and check on her.

519
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
But after the checkup,

520
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,200
he couldn't tell what this is.

521
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,120
Have you ever seen such symptoms?

522
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
I can't identify what this is either.

523
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,400
But seeing her like this,

524
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,040
it doesn't seem like she's sick.

525
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,000
It looks more like she's been poisoned.

526
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,720
Poison?

527
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,520
Which scoundrel

528
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
wants to harm my daughter?

529
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,200
Poison?

530
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,760
It was Princess Ying.

531
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,800
Caiwei went to see

532
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,560
Princess Ying earlier.

533
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,120
Wasn't harming my daughter enough?

534
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,240
Why are you even

535
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,000
involved with Princess Ying?

536
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,280
Enough with the nonsense!

537
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,360
Why would Princess Ying

538
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,080
poison Caiwei?

539
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,480
Xing,

540
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,040
stop showing off.

541
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,520
Even the Healer from the palace was here.

542
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,560
How is it that only you noticed

543
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,480
that she has been poisoned?

544
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,280
I have a suspicion that it's poisoning.

545
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,360
But I can't identify what poison it is.

546
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
And I certainly can't identify the poisoner.

547
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,520
She has thread-like strands on her,

548
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,480
which look like silkworm cocoons.

549
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,920
Silkworm cocoons?

550
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,360
Could it possibly be

551
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,840
Chen Huo'e?

552
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,960
No, that's impossible.

553
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,680
Chen Huo'e has already been executed.

554
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,800
I witnessed it myself.

555
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,800
She couldn't have poisoned anyone again.

556
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,640
I knew what was going on.

557
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,280
I visited the Imperial Guard.

558
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,920
I asked Jing Lin to check the records.

559
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,880
When the Fire Moth Sect caused chaos,

560
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,880
there was a type of poison that

561
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,200
could cause similar symptoms.

562
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,240
Mojie,

563
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,760
Chen Huo'e has already been executed.

564
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,880
Are there any remaining supporters of the

565
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,280
Fire Moth Sect that we can track down?

566
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,960
This is the challenge.

567
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,600
After Chen Huo'e's death,

568
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,800
the Fire Moth Sect seemed to

569
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
vanish all of a sudden,

570
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,960
leaving no trace behind.

571
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,240
The records in the Imperial Guard

572
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,360
offer no leads.

573
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,400
Where else can we look?

574
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,320
Should we...

575
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
seek out Princess Ying?

576
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,040
Since the poison was administered

577
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,640
by Chen Huo'e, let's not bring up

578
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,040
Princess Ying again.

579
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,680
If this involves her,

580
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,200
implicating the royal family

581
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,480
would be a serious crime.

582
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
Have you forgotten the incident with

583
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,920
the destruction of the Jinxiu Workshop?

584
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,680
Since it's the Fire Moth Sect's poison,

585
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,800
it may not necessarily

586
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,880
have been Princess Ying's doing.

587
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Yan Xing,

588
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,400
you might have

589
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,000
caused trouble for your sister.

590
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,240
-Han Shiyuan, you... -Mother.

591
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,240
What Mr.Han said is true.

592
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,840
This time, I fear that Caiwei might truly

593
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,480
be caught in the crossfire because of me,

594
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,560
and face Fire Moth Sect's retaliation.

595
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
This is all my fault.

596
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,080
Ease your mind.

597
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
Even if it costs me my life, I'll

598
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,800
do everything in my power to save her.

599
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,320
Stop right there!

600
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,800
Where do you think you are going?

601
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,600
Do you want me to

602
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
lose another daughter?

603
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,640
Father.

604
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,880
Xing,

605
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,720
you are also my daughter!

606
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,800
Father, don't worry about me.

607
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,840
I will be extremely cautious.

608
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
I promise that

609
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,640
nothing will happen to Caiwei.

610
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,880
Not this one.

611
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,200
The cocoon poison...

612
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,040
Where could the recipe of

613
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,240
the antidote possibly be?

614
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,680
Mom, I haven't

615
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,640
had the chance to visit you lately.

616
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,480
Are you upset with me?

617
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
I genuinely wanted to visit you.

618
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,480
It's just that

619
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,600
I'm afraid of encountering someone.

620
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,360
That person

621
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,760
is usually a formidable villain,

622
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,320
who chills everyone at his name.

623
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,200
But when he disguises himself as the maskman,

624
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,880
he becomes quite intriguing

625
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,280
and surprisingly charming.

626
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,120
It feels as if he transforms into a

627
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,160
totally different man from his usual self.

628
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,680
Mom,

629
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,880
you've met him before.

630
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,320
I even considered him a friend back then.

631
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,280
His mother

632
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,760
must have

633
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,840
become good friends with you.

634
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,239
Mom, you don't

635
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,200
think he seems like a bad person either,

636
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:34,920
right?

637
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,560
So,

638
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,880
what should I do?

639
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,640
You can just think of me

640
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,719
as a mysterious figure,

641
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:53,200
the maskman.

642
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,920
You...

643
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,759
You're here...

644
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,840
I've always been around.

645
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,400
Lord...

646
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,520
Chancellor Lai...

647
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,160
I've mentioned it before,

648
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,320
in this place,

649
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,320
you can continue to see me

650
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,360
as maskman.

651
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,120
As a friend.

652
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,200
Does the Dark Demon need friends too?

653
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,560
Perhaps,

654
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I should give it a try.

655
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,280
Indeed,

656
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,200
even The White Death could get married.

657
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Then the Dark Demon

658
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,520
certainly needs

659
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
friends too.

660
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,600
However,

661
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,840
my friends and I

662
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,680
engage in equal exchanges.

663
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,640
And friends should

664
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,920
support each other through challenges

665
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,040
and share secrets with each other.

666
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,960
Can you...

667
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,920
Why don't you start first?

668
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Let me hear what you have.

669
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,560
Share a secret?

670
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Honestly, I seem to have

671
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,480
no secrets at the moment.

672
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,520
However,

673
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,000
I have run out of pocket money.

674
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,800
I went to the Shen residence for a meal.

675
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,560
Does that count?

676
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,960
Alright.

677
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,280
Now it's my turn.

678
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,640
So you do have a secret

679
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,560
to share with me.

680
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
I know you and Yan Xing

681
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,560
are colleagues and besties.

682
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,520
I heard that her sister

683
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,680
has been poisoned with the cocoon poison

684
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,080
from the Fire Moth Sect.

685
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,640
And I

686
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,600
just happen to have

687
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,760
an antidote recipe for that poison.

688
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,040
How did you get the antidote recipe?

689
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,400
Chen Huo'e was captured and interrogated

690
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,000
twice by the Imperial Inspectorate.

691
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,320
You should be aware of this.

692
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,520
It was during that time

693
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,000
that I obtained the recipe.

694
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,840
So why

695
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,880
are you offering it to me?

696
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,600
I can give you the recipe,

697
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,560
but I have one condition.

698
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,640
What condition?

699
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,320
Just don't mention that it's from me.

700
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Why not?

701
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
You've done a good deed.

702
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,040
So why can't it be said

703
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,960
that you provided it?

704
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,480
You can certainly doubt it.

705
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
Yan Xing can also choose to doubt it.

706
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,280
First of all, this recipe

707
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,680
has not been verified for authenticity.

708
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,480
If it fails to cure the poison

709
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,840
or if the condition worsens,

710
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,320
I won't take any responsibility.

711
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,440
Secondly,

712
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,920
there's an ingredient in this recipe

713
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,600
that is extremely rare:

714
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,360
the blood of a doppelganger.

715
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,880
Whether it can be found

716
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,080
depends on Caiwei's fortune.

717
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,320
Xing,

718
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,120
have you been searching for all night?

719
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,320
I'm sorry,

720
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,560
but I can't hang out with you today.

721
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm searching for a

722
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,400
life-saving recipe.

723
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,160
Xing,

724
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,120
would you like to take a look at this?

725
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
The antidote recipe for the cocoon poison?

726
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,760
How do you know

727
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,920
that my sister was poisoned?

728
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,520
Where did you

729
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,840
get this recipe?

730
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,200
I... I got it from a friend.

731
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,000
A friend?

732
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,200
When did you find

733
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,840
such a resourceful friend?

734
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,880
Well,

735
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,320
anyway, this must be the recipe, right?

736
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,040
It seems to have leaked

737
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,960
from the Imperial Inspectorate.

738
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
It's said to have been obtained

739
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
during the interrogation of Chen Huo'e.

740
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,080
But as for this recipe,

741
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,560
I can't tell if it's genuine or not.

742
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,560
I have no idea if it will actually work.

743
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,640
Imperial Inspectorate?

744
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,000
Chen Huo'e?

745
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,720
The creator is also the antidote-bearer,

746
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,760
so who could the poisoner be?

747
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,960
How did you just happen to

748
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
come across this recipe?

749
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,840
I...

750
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,880
Don't worry about the recipe for now.

751
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,520
I think it would be best that you

752
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,960
visit a healing house.

753
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,120
Have them verify whether

754
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,640
this recipe is authentic,

755
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
and whether it might be poisonous.

756
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
And even if it is genuine,

757
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,840
it still requires

758
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,160
the heart's blood of a doppelganger

759
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,120
as an ingredient.

760
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,720
But...

761
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,880
In this world,

762
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,280
there was only one doppelganger,

763
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,400
and that was Chen Huo'e, right?

764
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,360
Besides,

765
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,880
she was decapitated by your

766
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,000
sweet The White Death, right?

767
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,680
Yes, that's true.

768
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,400
Chen Huo'e is dead.

769
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,080
In today's world,

770
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,600
where can we find

771
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,400
another doppelganger?

772
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,560
Master Chen went into the mountains,

773
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,680
and his return is uncertain.

774
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,320
Lady Yan, you should be aware of this.

775
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
Chief Xu?

776
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,280
Not just you,

777
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,960
I haven't seen him lately either.

778
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,200
Excuse me,

779
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
do you know where Pan Chi is?

780
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,960
Looking for Pan, huh?

781
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
He left several days ago.

782
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,360
I heard he was chasing after

783
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,880
the Xichen merchant

784
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,880
with a beautiful lady.

785
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,360
Young folks nowadays...

786
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,440
Ridiculous...

787
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,880
Your Highness!

788
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,400
Yan Caiwei has been poisoned.

789
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,960
She has been poisoned?

790
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,360
I heard that

791
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,000
it's a deadly poison that cannot be cured.

792
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,080
I intended to give her a mere warning.

793
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,760
So I slipped some

794
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
herbs that

795
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,080
induce nightmares

796
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,120
into her tea.

797
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,880
I've already consulted the imperial healer,

798
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,840
and there's no danger to her life.

799
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,200
So it seems

800
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,000
someone is trying to frame Your Highness.

801
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,520
Indeed.

802
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,520
Framing...

803
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,000
While Yan Caiwei's life

804
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,320
may not seem significant,

805
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,400
her father, Erudite Yan

806
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,880
is a subordinate of Lord Zhang.

807
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,880
Her sister, Yan Xing,

808
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,360
is Shen Du's wife.

809
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,080
If she were to die,

810
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,120
I would be at odds with Prince Xian,

811
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,480
and also with the Imperial Guard.

812
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,800
I would be making enemies.

813
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,560
It's clear that the one who poisoned her

814
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,880
must have had malicious intentions.

815
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,160
Kick his ass!

816
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,120
Harder!
