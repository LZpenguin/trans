Melody of Golden Age EP37

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,760
You cannot provide me

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,440
with a peaceful and carefree household,

5
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,160
nor do you hold your husband in the highest regard.

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
You are always competitive,

7
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,440
always wanting to stand out.

8
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
You are not someone I can

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,320
envision spending my life with.

10
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,880
What?

11
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,160
Is this how you see me?

12
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,040
Do you genuinely believe

13
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
that you are a good wife?

14
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Your thoughts are consumed by

15
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
investigations and case files.

16
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
What kind of wife

17
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
does a man truly desire?

18
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,560
Have you ever pondered this?

19
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
You are merely a stand-in bride.

20
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,520
And you bear the identity of a spy.

21
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's not forsake the agreement we forged.

22
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,520
The three-month pact is over.

23
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,600
I, Shen Du,

24
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,720
am resolute in my decision to divorce you.

25
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,280
If so,

26
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
then let's proceed with the divorce.

27
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
From this day forward, I, Yan Xing,

28
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,200
will sever all ties with you,

29
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Our paths will diverge.

30
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,000
Everything related to you, The White Death,

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,399
I will no longer involve myself with.

32
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,760
The honor and disgrace of the Shen family,

33
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,440
from now on, are no longer my concern!

34
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,840
Xing!

35
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,280
Xing,

36
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,520
what's the matter?

37
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,680
You look unwell.

38
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
What has happened?

39
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Mother...

40
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,960
Xing?

41
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,560
Xing!

42
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,200
Xing, Xing.

43
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,600
Shen Du!

44
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,080
Shen Du.

45
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,240
Shen Du...

46
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,600
Xing,

47
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
You're awake.

48
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,640
Your fever

49
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,159
has truly frightened me.

50
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,960
Where are you going?

51
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
I need to see Shen Du...

52
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,720
Don't go!

53
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,360
What do you want with that scoundrel?

54
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,320
You braved the snow to seek justice

55
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,720
for him, but what did he do in return?

56
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,800
After he got released,

57
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,800
he didn't even care about your condition.

58
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,480
And...

59
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,760
And what?

60
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
What's wrong with your voice?

61
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,960
And what else?

62
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
He even brought the divorce papers!

63
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Mother.

64
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,480
Where are the divorce papers?

65
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Where are the divorce papers, Mother?

66
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
Where are the divorce papers?

67
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,720
Where are the divorce papers, Mother?

68
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,760
Where are the divorce papers?

69
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,280
Where are the divorce papers?

70
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,080
Where are the divorce papers...

71
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,080
Mother!

72
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,280
I still can't wrap my head around this.

73
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,080
Lord Shen seems

74
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,480
so principled.

75
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,120
How could he

76
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,840
so openly ally with the Dark Demon?

77
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,160
In the past few days, Shen Du has been

78
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,080
leading the Imperial Guard in apprehending

79
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
many officials who have not

80
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,880
sided with Lai Luozhi.

81
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
The Imperial Guard has now

82
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,520
completely degenerated into the

83
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,920
enforcers of the Imperial Inspectorate.

84
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,760
With his choice made,

85
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
what will become of our Yan Family...

86
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,400
Mojie.

87
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,280
Since Shen Du

88
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
has even delivered the divorce papers,

89
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,520
then from this point forward,

90
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,760
whatever he chooses to do,

91
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,360
it will have no further connection

92
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
to our Yan Family.

93
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,480
In light of the current situation,

94
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
divorce might actually be a blessing

95
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,960
for the Yan Family to avoid turmoil.

96
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,920
But Xing

97
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
is bound to be heartbroken.

98
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,600
Her sorrow will likely

99
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,920
extend beyond this, especially considering

100
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,880
that the Chief Inspector, who has always

101
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,920
been close to her, and Lady Yun Que,

102
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
were executed by the Imperial Inspectorate

103
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,480
under the guise of quelling chaos,

104
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,360
on the very night they assisted her in

105
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,360
entering the palace to seek justice.

106
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,960
Xing...

107
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,160
Xiangren and Yun Que

108
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,440
are gone...

109
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,560
Xing!

110
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
You've just recovered from your fever,

111
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
are you trying to endanger your life?

112
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,040
Xiangren,

113
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,440
Yun Que,

114
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,040
I am to blame for your tragedy;

115
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,160
I owe you my deepest apologies!

116
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,160
Even if it weren't for your sake,

117
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
they would still have met their end.

118
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
Shen Du...

119
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,600
Don't hold their deaths

120
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
against yourself.

121
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,120
You're not that significant.

122
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,720
Xu Xiangren was seeking evidence

123
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,600
of Chancellor Lai's treason,

124
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
which is why he had to die.

125
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,320
Did you truly align yourself with him?

126
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,640
On the night Xiangren and Yun Que fell,

127
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,840
you were set free.

128
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,680
Could it be that you...

129
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,080
Shen Du,

130
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
what is happening to you?

131
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,680
Have you forgotten your aspirations?

132
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
Have you forgotten the grievances of

133
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
the Shens and the

134
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,600
countless innocent lives lost?

135
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,120
I came here today to urge you

136
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,160
not to complicate matters further.

137
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
For the sake of the Yan Family,

138
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,680
you should sign the divorce papers.

139
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,640
With your blood,

140
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
let us part ways.

141
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,720
For Xiangren and Yun Que,

142
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,600
for all those who died unjustly,

143
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,720
Shen Du,

144
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,760
from this moment on,

145
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,920
we shall be strangers!

146
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,719
Xing!

147
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,760
Xing,

148
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,560
what's the matter?

149
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,959
We went to the Yan residence,

150
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,480
and your mother told us you weren't home.

151
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,160
Jiang Langxing and I

152
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,440
rushed over to find you.

153
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,240
Have you been to the grave?

154
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,520
Xiangren and Yun Que

155
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,120
lost their lives because of me...

156
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,000
Xing,

157
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,000
please don't think that way.

158
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
The reason Lai Luozhi resents Chief Xu is

159
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
that Chief Xu saved me from his clutches.

160
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,600
Yet I remain unharmed...

161
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,000
Chief Xu and Yun Que,

162
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,600
they departed peacefully.

163
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,280
I believe

164
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,640
they are happy

165
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,040
in the afterlife.

166
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,760
Are you injured?

167
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,960
Shen Du has resolved

168
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,040
to ally with Lai Luozhi.

169
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,440
Has The White Death

170
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,000
truly joined forces with Lai Luozhi?

171
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,680
He is no longer

172
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,400
the Shen Du I once knew.

173
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,960
From this moment on,

174
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,600
I won't have anything to do with him!

175
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,920
Xing!

176
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,760
Xing...

177
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,160
If you're worried about her,

178
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,080
why not go and talk to her?

179
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
A parent knows their child best.

180
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,520
She's always been independent.

181
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,080
In light of such a significant event,

182
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
if we just approach her like that,

183
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,720
she will definitely

184
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,360
put on a brave face

185
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,640
and conceal her true feelings

186
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,240
to spare us from worry.

187
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,080
That's right.

188
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,080
She has always been considerate of others.

189
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,240
Women,

190
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,160
we always bottle up

191
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,520
our grievances.

192
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,120
It can lead to illness!

193
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,520
Let her have some time alone.

194
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
You'll have to make do tonight.

195
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,720
Just bear with it.

196
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
If you're willing to share,

197
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,040
there's still half a space here.

198
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,120
You can sleep in there.

199
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,640
As if it were fate,

200
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,920
she became my wife.

201
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
I want to let her know

202
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
that in my heart,

203
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,240
from the very beginning,

204
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,120
the one has always been her.

205
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,360
You cannot provide me

206
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,040
with a peaceful and carefree household,

207
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,640
nor do you hold your husband in the highest regard.

208
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,080
You are always competitive,

209
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
always wanting to stand out.

210
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,400
You are not someone I can

211
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,880
envision spending my life with.

212
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,640
The three-month pact is over.

213
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,680
I, Shen Du,

214
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,080
am resolute in my decision to divorce you.

215
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,040
She still hasn't eaten yet?

216
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,560
She hasn't taken a single bite.

217
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,600
She refuses to take her medicine,

218
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,200
and she hasn't even bandaged her wounds.

219
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,640
She won't even open the door.

220
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
What should we do?

221
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,560
I just got divorced myself, and I've

222
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,160
been eating well and sleeping soundly.

223
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,640
Life is much more enjoyable than before!

224
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,880
She can't keep up like this.

225
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,360
Let me go talk to her.

226
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
That sounds good.

227
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,280
Father!

228
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,040
Father, bad news!

229
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,720
I just went to buy some snacks for Xing,

230
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,440
and I noticed that men from the Imperial

231
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,120
Inspectorate are all around our house!

232
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,680
Are you certain it's them?

233
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,400
Having worked for the IG for so long,

234
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,720
I can easily spot

235
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,280
these operatives.

236
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,680
It seems the Imperial Inspectorate has

237
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,040
set its sights on the Yan Family!

238
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,880
A disaster!

239
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,280
A true disaster!

240
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,560
I have served as an official for years,

241
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,720
and I've never experienced such a situation.

242
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,160
The political landscape is ever-changing.

243
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,080
Lai Luozhi has its influence everywhere.

244
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,120
Now that Shen Du has just divorced Xing

245
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,880
and has allied himself with Lai Luozhi,

246
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,120
what does this signify?

247
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,040
What?

248
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,280
It signifies that

249
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
our Yan Family is in peril.

250
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,880
Your Majesty,

251
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,400
with spring approaching,

252
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,320
the annual grand assembly

253
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,240
is about to begin its preparations.

254
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,640
This agenda is drafted by

255
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,080
the Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Rites

256
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,400
based on the usual procedures.

257
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,360
Then, officials from various regions

258
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,200
and military commanders from all garrisons

259
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,640
will return to pay their respects.

260
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,360
However,

261
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,440
since Your Majesty ascended the throne,

262
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
the assemblies have always been scheduled

263
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,560
on the second day of the second month,

264
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,000
during spring plowing.

265
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,960
But this year,

266
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,480
Her Royal Highness is unwell.

267
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,360
Should we select another auspicious day?

268
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,600
The grand assembly

269
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,520
is a significant event for determining

270
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,920
political affairs each year.

271
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,240
It also involves regional officials

272
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,160
and commanders from various garrisons.

273
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,080
It should not be postponed lightly.

274
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
The second day of the second month it is.

275
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,480
If Her Royal Highness

276
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,200
is still unwell by that time,

277
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,600
I will accompany

278
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,280
His Majesty to host

279
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,360
the grand assembly.

280
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,680
Chancellor Lai,

281
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,360
are you truly going to

282
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,800
preside over the grand assembly

283
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,560
on behalf of Her Royal Highness?

284
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,560
What's wrong with that?

285
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,880
Chancellor Lai,

286
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,240
the grand assembly

287
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,200
is an annual event for all officials,

288
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
showcasing the emperor's authority

289
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,120
and the royal prestige.

290
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,520
The Empress Dowager, who is presiding,

291
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,920
is acting in the role of the emperor.

292
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,760
As for you,

293
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
what gives you the right to do so?

294
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,520
Because Her Royal Highness trusts me,

295
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,040
and because she has entrusted me with

296
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,400
the responsibility of overseeing the court.

297
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,720
I must take on the duty

298
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,920
for various affairs in the court!

299
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,000
I believe

300
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,280
Your Majesty would also be very willing

301
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,520
to have me accompany you

302
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
in hosting the grand assembly to meet

303
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,640
with officials and generals, right?

304
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,760
His Majesty is

305
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,400
inviting Chancellor Lai!

306
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,040
It's evident that His Majesty

307
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
wishes for Chancellor Lai to stand by his side

308
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,920
during the grand assembly!

309
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,520
Indeed.

310
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,840
Her Royal Highness has entrusted Lord Lai

311
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,040
to oversee the officials.

312
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,400
It is only fitting for him to preside

313
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,440
over the grand assembly.

314
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,120
It is entirely justified for Chancellor Lai

315
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
to take charge of the grand assembly.

316
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,920
You rascals! Boldly distorting

317
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,280
the facts without a shred of shame!

318
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,280
And you,

319
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Lai Luozhi,

320
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,880
you dare to overstep your bounds with

321
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,760
your treacherous intentions laid bare!

322
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,960
You deserve the severest penalty!

323
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,840
Lord Shen,

324
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,840
you have said nothing today.

325
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,080
Why not speak up?

326
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
To insult a high-ranking official,

327
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,520
Are there any legal consequences

328
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,200
for a situation like this?

329
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,680
To insult a high-ranking official,

330
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,560
one should be imprisoned in the dungeon

331
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,640
and subjected to waterboarding.

332
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,920
Very well!

333
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,960
Let's proceed with it.

334
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,560
Shen Du, you...

335
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,520
Lord Shen,

336
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
when did you

337
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,440
become so loyal to him?

338
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
Lord Zhang,

339
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,040
Princess Ying,

340
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,840
it seems you

341
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,480
are quite displeased with me?

342
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,360
Are you afraid that I will

343
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,840
uncover your

344
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,640
dirty and sordid affairs?

345
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,320
Nonsense!

346
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,080
Princess Ying,

347
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,800
Lord Zhang, you were

348
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,280
colluding with the rebels of Gannan,

349
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,800
plotting treason!

350
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,040
Lai Luozhi,

351
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,240
don't you slander us!

352
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,000
Lai Luozhi,

353
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
Chancellor Lai,

354
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,000
you have always suppressed

355
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,120
the officials who oppose you.

356
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,160
Today,

357
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,080
is it finally my turn?

358
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,480
But everything must be based on evidence.

359
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,000
With God watching,

360
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,040
how dare you twist the truth

361
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,200
and turn things upside down!

362
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,840
Evidence?

363
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,440
Of course, there is evidence!

364
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
I obtained from the Imperial Guard

365
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,680
the booklet

366
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,120
from Mo Qianzhi, which clearly

367
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
documents each and every case.

368
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,080
You cannot refute it!

369
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:43,920
You...

370
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,720
Isn't that right, Lord Shen?

371
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,200
According to his earlier testimony,

372
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,600
Princess Ying colluded with the garrison in Gannan,

373
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,440
and Lord Zhang allowed his subordinates

374
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,240
to embezzle funds from Gannan.

375
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,040
They should be confined in their residences

376
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,680
for further investigations.

377
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
The empire belongs to the Xiao Family.

378
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,640
We will not tolerate your insolence!

379
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,920
Palace Guards!

380
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,520
Where are the Palace Guards?

381
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,040
Your Highness,

382
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,600
can you not see it yet?

383
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,760
Now, in the imperial court, most

384
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,960
officials have already sided with him!

385
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,480
With your status,

386
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,480
it would be better

387
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,080
to leave with some dignity.

388
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,040
Do you want me to send

389
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,160
the Imperial Inspectorate and

390
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,200
the Imperial Guard to arrest you?

391
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,360
Shen Du, you scoundrel,

392
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,400
you actually collude with the Dark Demon!

393
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,400
You lot,

394
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,720
who cannot distinguish right from wrong,

395
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,840
traitorous scoundrels,

396
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
you will surely meet a miserable end!

397
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,320
you will meet a miserable end!

398
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,720
I've never expected,

399
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,560
that despite my sincere efforts,

400
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,680
I cannot repay the grace of

401
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,760
His Majesty and Her Royal Highness,

402
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,840
yet I am slandered by

403
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,040
these shameless individuals!

404
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,400
Now that I bear heavy responsibilities,

405
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,000
I can only serve with utmost loyalty

406
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,640
until death, caring not for

407
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,880
my reputation in life or after death.

408
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
Isn't that right,

409
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,240
Lord Shen?

410
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,080
Then,

411
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,400
should we proceed

412
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,720
as discussed earlier?

413
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,040
What was that?

414
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,680
You lowly

415
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,440
commoners dare to enter the academy?

416
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,720
You truly tarnish

417
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,320
the reputation of the Imperial Academy.

418
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,440
It must be thoroughly cleaned.

419
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,600
I

420
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,800
was admitted to the

421
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,760
Imperial Academy through the exams,

422
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,360
and knowledge knows no class distinction.

423
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,440
Why do you insult us like this?

424
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,520
You are merely

425
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,480
a stray dog

426
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,720
the academy let in.

427
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,040
Do you really believe you can stand

428
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,160
on equal footing with us, the gentry?

429
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,200
Remember,

430
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,280
a dog, even if it enters the house,

431
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,160
is still just a dog!

432
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,400
Chancellor Lai

433
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,040
also has no gentry background.

434
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,080
You all, as gentry,

435
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,320
are eager to flatter him.

436
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,280
Seems like you are quite willing

437
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,640
to be his dogs!

438
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,120
Outrageous!

439
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,720
Get him!

440
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,720
Stop!

441
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,240
My lord,

442
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,040
these gentry students

443
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,920
are teaming up to bully us!

444
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,000
The Imperial Academy is the most

445
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,000
prestigious institution in the empire.

446
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,040
It is directly overseen by the emperor.

447
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,360
You are not focusing on your studies

448
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,240
but are here making noise and fighting.

449
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,280
This is outrageous!

450
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,080
I...

451
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,720
It was them...

452
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,840
Yeah,

453
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,720
it was him.

454
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,200
He is the one who spreads rumors

455
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,040
and disrupts our studies!

456
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,680
Yes, yes, it's him!

457
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,120
It's him who spreads rumors!

458
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,600
My lord,

459
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,360
that's not true.

460
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,240
It's them...

461
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,680
Since you are here

462
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,080
disturbing other students,

463
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,160
you will be detained in the dungeon

464
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,280
to reflect on your actions!

465
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,600
What has happened

466
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,840
to the Imperial Guard?

467
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,400
Have you really sided with the treacherous?

468
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,600
It was Lord Shen

469
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,360
who escorted us here to take the exams.

470
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,240
He said the Imperial Academy

471
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,440
accepts talents regardless of background.

472
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,280
Now,

473
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,560
are you telling me

474
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,960
that the students from humble origins,

475
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,160
who strive to study,

476
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,080
have made a mistake?

477
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,360
Ignoring the signs and lacking the

478
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,800
wisdom to act accordingly

479
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,440
is indeed a mistake.

480
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,000
Take him away!

481
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,080
Dare to challenge us?

482
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,920
Yeah.

483
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,720
You brought this upon yourself!

484
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,839
Get out of the way!

485
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,400
Everyone, move aside!

486
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,440
People refer to us as

487
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,600
White Death and Dark Demon.

488
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,520
Now, you and I are side by side,

489
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,520
taking a stroll in the mortal realm.

490
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,520
It really is quite a unique experience.

491
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,359
With such a spacious street,

492
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,920
can't the Imperial Inspectorate

493
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,319
proceed properly?

494
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,040
Why must you charge around like this,

495
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,240
bullying the civilians?

496
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,480
Allowing lowly scums

497
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,759
to obstruct Lord Lai's passage,

498
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:17,960
you delinquents are doing a lousy job!

499
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,280
Our duty as the Delinquents

500
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,680
is to defend the capital

501
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,760
and ensure the safety of the civilians,

502
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
not to serve as anyone's lackey.

503
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,920
They are truly an eyesore.

504
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,760
The security of the capital falls

505
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,600
under the Imperial Guard's jurisdiction.

506
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,400
These useless

507
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,600
petty thieves should not be allowed

508
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,720
to stir up trouble in the city, right?

509
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,120
Indeed.

510
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,040
Shen Du!

511
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,840
In aiding the oppressor

512
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,800
and failing to see the truth,

513
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,080
how could you honor the memory of

514
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,280
Chief Xu and Yun Que? How can you face

515
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,760
Yan Xing with a clear conscience?

516
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,080
A lowly delinquent dares to challenge

517
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,680
the commander of the Imperial Guard?

518
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,360
It seems you have never experienced

519
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,000
the Imperial Inspectorate's waterboard.

520
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
Arrest him!

521
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,640
Wait!

522
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,760
Since he has insulted me,

523
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,960
I will

524
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,880
take this upon myself then.

525
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,000
Today, I will spare your life

526
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,520
so you can return

527
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,040
and keep your men in check.

528
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,320
Inform them

529
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,840
that our

530
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,320
past friendship

531
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,680
is a thing of the past.

532
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,920
If you dare to speak out of turn again,

533
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,520
you will find no sanctuary in life

534
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,680
nor an escape in death!

535
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,680
Chui!

536
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,960
I've heard that Jiang Langxing

537
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,840
was publicly humiliated by White Death.

538
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,400
What?

539
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,600
He publicly humiliated Jiang Langxing?

540
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
Yes,

541
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,520
that's what I heard.

542
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
It's because he brought the Delinquents

543
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,600
to confront Chancellor Lai.

544
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,920
Shen Du?

545
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,720
He...

546
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,360
has sided with Lai Luozhi?

547
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,800
White Death and Dark Demon

548
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,240
have joined forces?

549
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Shen Du...

550
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,600
I'd like to find out whether his

551
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,440
conscience has been eaten by a dog!

552
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,480
Where's the man in charge?

553
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,600
Let me go!

554
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,600
Move!

555
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,000
Behave yourself!

556
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,480
To what do we owe the pleasure of your

557
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
visit to the Ministry of Justice today?

558
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,240
Greetings, Chancellor Lai...

559
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,560
Poker face.

560
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm fine.

561
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,320
I received a report that the records from

562
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,560
the Ministry of Justice are unorganized,

563
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,800
full of inconsistencies.

564
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,320
I wonder who is responsible for this?

565
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,040
It's...

566
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,880
Greetings, Lady Lu.

567
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,600
Talk about a storm in a teacup!

568
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,440
Who dared to file a complaint

569
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,880
against the Ministry of Justice?

570
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,200
Doesn't he know that

571
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,920
Lady Lu is under

572
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,040
my protection?

573
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,000
Take him away!

574
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,640
My lord!

575
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,680
If anyone

576
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,600
dares to disturb Lady Lu again,

577
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,320
then they are directly opposing me!

578
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,520
Chui.

579
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,960
Ease your mind.

580
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,440
Wherever you go,

581
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,880
you will always be under my protection!

582
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,680
In your dreams!

583
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,920
Is that so?

584
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,640
Lai Luozhi!

585
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,680
Villain!

586
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,840
Unhand me! If you're

587
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,440
man enough, let's duel to the death.

588
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,200
You, someone I am

589
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,680
stepping on like an ant,

590
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,360
dare to request a duel with me?

591
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,360
Do you even think you're worthy?

592
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,200
Lai Luozhi,

593
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,640
what exactly do you want?

594
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,000
What's the matter?

595
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Feeling heartbroken?

596
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,160
You're actually shedding tears for

597
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
such a lowly creature.

598
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,040
I truly feel sorry for you!

599
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,280
Honestly, I don't want

600
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,000
to make things difficult for you at all.

601
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,480
It's just that I couldn't sleep last night,

602
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,760
and I remembered

603
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
the song you used to sing.

604
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,600
Why don't you sing it for me again?

605
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,240
Maybe if my mood improves,

606
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,680
I might be inclined

607
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,920
to show him some mercy.

608
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,680
Chui,

609
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,400
don't listen to him.

610
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,640
Don't sing!

611
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,920
Be quiet!

612
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,240
Don't!

I've told you before,

as long as you stay by my side,

625
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,120
you will get

626
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,360
everything you desire.

627
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,040
As for those you care about,

628
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,720
I won't make things too hard for them

629
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,520
out of consideration for you.
