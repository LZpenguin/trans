00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:48,160
Melody of Golden Age EP33

3
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,440
It's the first time I've heard someone

4
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,000
sing a nursery rhyme in a graveyard.

5
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,120
At a dark and windy night,

6
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,560
it is rather intriguing.

7
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,080
It's you.

8
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,760
You saved me.

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,840
You can take me

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,920
as a mysterious man,

11
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,880
the Maskman,

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,640
a friend.

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,800
Lady Lu,

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,360
how could you come to the II

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,599
and leave without

16
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,960
saying goodbye?

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,160
Lai Luozhi

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,520
has done so many bad deeds.

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,920
He must have been pretending.

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,080
He might even

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
have some ulterior motives

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,080
for reaching out to me.

23
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,520
Excuse me.

24
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Coming through.

25
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Excuse me.

26
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,760
Poker face!

27
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,639
Thank you, sir,

28
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
Here.

29
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200
Try this.

30
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,600
Try it.

31
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,160
What are you doing?

32
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,400
Why are you following me?

33
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
To... to protect you.

34
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
Protect me?

35
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
How long have you been following me?

36
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,720
Not... not that long.

37
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,160
So,

38
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
that's why Yun Que has been

39
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
following Chief Xu around,

40
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
because you have spent all your time

41
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,000
following me?

42
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,120
Not entirely.

43
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Yun Que...

44
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,960
You fool!

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,320
He is your boss.

46
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,520
So why are you following me?

47
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm afraid you might run into danger.

48
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,200
Then you should've just told me.

49
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,120
Why did you sneak around like a thief?

50
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,640
You wouldn't have agreed.

51
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,360
Sir,

52
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
how much is this?

53
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I already paid.

54
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,240
You're still

55
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,920
the same as when you were little,

56
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,640
always throwing around gold ingots

57
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,920
without regard for their worth.

58
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Nonsense.

59
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,400
I, Lu Chuichui,

60
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
have always been very prudent

61
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,080
with my spending.

62
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,120
How do you know that since I was little...

63
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
You're blushing!

64
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Why are you blushing?

65
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,280
You haven't even had any wontons yet.

66
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Come with me.

67
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,920
Such... Such...

68
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,240
Such a big gold ingot.

69
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,880
When did you

70
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,280
become this rich?

71
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
A man shouldn't

72
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,640
spend his life serving others,

73
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,960
but should do something more meaningful

74
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,280
to help more people.

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,880
Little Miss.

76
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,320
Little Miss,

77
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,760
from now on, I'm your person.

78
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
From now on,

79
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm your person.

80
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
It was you,

81
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,400
the poor kid who had to sell himself?

82
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,159
Chuichui,

83
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I listened to you.

84
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,320
I worked hard and had helped

85
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
many, many people.

86
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
From the moment you gave me this gold,

87
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,480
I, Jiang Langxing,

88
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,560
became Lu Chuichui's person.

89
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,280
Ying.

90
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,000
Lord Shen.

91
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,080
I've heard that Lord Shen

92
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,920
usually avoids such banquets.

93
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,360
I didn't expect to see you

94
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,440
come here with Lady Yan today.

95
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
It's truly a pleasant surprise.

96
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,680
Now that Lord Shen has arrived,

97
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,040
why hasn't the equally famous

98
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,480
Chancellor Lai arrived yet?

99
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,640
I apologize for being late.

100
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,840
As the snow is about to fall,

101
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
I wonder if Fu would have the honor

102
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,400
to join Princess Ying and the ladies

103
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,240
to watch the snow.

104
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Fu.

105
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Lord Lai,

106
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,320
it is indeed a great honor for me

107
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,720
to have both you and your sister here.

108
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,880
I apologize for being late.

109
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,280
Please forgive me.

110
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
Why don't you all take your seats,

111
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,440
and I will pour wine

112
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,560
for everyone to apologize.

113
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
Good.

114
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,720
Take your seats.

115
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
Your Highness.

116
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
I apologize.

117
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,240
She looks so agile

118
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,280
and doesn't look like

119
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,600
she's been hurt at all.

120
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,600
Could it be that you

121
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,160
really mistook someone for her in Gannan?

122
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,920
I heard that Lady Yan is very talented.

123
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,400
Perhaps you could perform a dance

124
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
and liven things up?

125
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,720
She has a point.

126
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,640
Lady Yan rarely attends such banquets.

127
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
So you mustn't disappoint Prince Xian.

128
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,440
You didn't become too proud now

129
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,640
that you have Her Highness's favor,

130
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,400
did you?

131
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,840
Don't you think so?

132
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,760
Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,880
Lord Zhang,

134
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,840
I remember when you were proposing

135
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,720
this marriage to the empress dowager,

136
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
you said that Lord Yan's daughter

137
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,400
is of great talent,

138
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,760
and her talents

139
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,040
are well-regarded in Xiang'an.

140
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,080
Today offers a great opportunity.

141
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,240
She must give us the chance

142
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,440
to appreciate her talents.

143
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,080
I have also heard that

144
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
Lady Yan once amazed everyone

145
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,560
at the Kaiyang Festival

146
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,200
with a pipa dance.

147
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
I wonder

148
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,080
if you might perform a new piece

149
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,680
for us today?

150
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,560
Erudite Yan's daughter

151
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,480
must be well-versed in the Six Arts.

152
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,040
Why not grace us with your performance?

153
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,040
My wife isn't...

154
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,800
Honey.

155
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
This is such a warm invitation.

156
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,600
Then I will happily join in the fun.

157
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,680
Honey,

158
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,000
may I borrow your sword?

159
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
Fortunately I've been watching

160
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,160
Shen Du's sword practice every day.

161
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
Lord Lai,

162
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,680
isn't your sister

163
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,840
a woman of seclusion?

164
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,560
How could she

165
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,320
have such great martial skills?

166
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,640
This stance

167
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
looks quite familiar.

168
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,280
I think...

169
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
I've seen it before.

170
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,200
I apologize.

171
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,080
Lord Lai,

172
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,760
Xing lacks skill in swordsmanship

173
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
and have offended your sister.

174
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,320
Fortunately, your sister

175
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,040
is exceptional at martial skills

176
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,640
and I sparred a few rounds with her.

177
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,640
Hope I did not spoil the banquet.

178
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,680
It's no bother.

179
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,000
Bravo!

180
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,760
Bravo!

181
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,080
The sword dance between

182
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Lady Yan and Chancellor Lai's sister

183
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,280
was quite the show.

184
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
What a sight to behold!

185
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,320
You're embarrassing yourself.

186
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,320
Go fix your attire, now.

187
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
You were far too reckless just now.

188
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,800
But it worked, didn't it?

189
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,000
Now your doubts

190
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,680
can be cleared.

191
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,280
It was Luo Fu

192
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,920
in Gannan.

193
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,560
Honey,

194
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,800
it might have looked easy,

195
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,040
but the sword was so heavy

196
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,680
that I almost

197
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,240
dropped it a few times.

198
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,920
Lady Yan, you're of remarkable talent, and

199
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,560
you two have such a loving relationship.

200
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,480
It's really enviable.

201
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
The sword dance of Lord Shen and Lady Yan

202
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,880
was truly eye-opening.

203
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,640
But the tune

204
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,200
that Mr. Jin just played

205
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,360
seems unfamiliar.

206
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,240
It's a new piece I composed

207
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,000
for the winter solstice,

208
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,120
called Joy and Sorrow.

209
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,080
Mr. Jin

210
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,800
is Mother's favorite musician.

211
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,680
It's quite hard to hear him perform.

212
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
And today at Prince Xian's banquet,

213
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,200
not only was he invited here to play

214
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,600
for us,

215
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,320
he also composed a new piece for us.

216
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
What a privilege indeed!

217
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
I didn't expect

218
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
to be able to hear

219
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
Mr. Jing's new piece today either.

220
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,640
It's truly a pleasant surprise.

221
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,800
As the cold deepens, snow is near.

222
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,720
What an elegant banquet indeed.

223
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,840
Everyone,

224
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,800
let's all raise our cups,

225
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,160
and thank Prince Xian for inviting us.

226
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Help me...

227
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,440
It hurts. It hurts.

228
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,920
Help me!

229
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,760
You were injured by Shen Du in Gannan,

230
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,200
and thanks to the Western medicine

231
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,880
that I spent a fortune on,

232
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,960
your wounds were controlled,

233
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,560
allowing you to attend the banquet

234
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,160
to clear your name.

235
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
Yet you acted recklessly

236
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
and had given yourself away!

237
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
You still can't realize your mistake?

238
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm going to kill Shen Du!

239
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,680
Now, your injuries have worsened,

240
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
and you've raised everyone's suspicion.

241
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,480
Recently,

242
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,240
you can't show your face in public again.

243
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,080
No. No.

244
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
No!

245
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,480
Give me a little time.

246
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,800
Just give me a little time.

247
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,040
Soon.

248
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,960
I will recover soon.

249
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,920
Recover?

250
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,840
And make people think it was you

251
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,360
who pretended to be Chen Huo'e again?

252
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,440
Believe me.

253
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,040
I can still be of use.

254
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,040
I can still be of use!

255
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,440
I still need to

256
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,640
play the role of your sister, don't I?

257
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,720
Give me a little time.

258
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,680
Believe me.

259
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,120
I will get better.

260
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,760
I will be good.

261
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,960
Help me.

262
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,600
I can still be of use.

263
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
Help me.

264
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
It hurts!

265
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Help me!

266
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,960
Just because it didn't snow,

267
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,640
so you are going to

268
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,160
turn yourself into a snowman?

269
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,440
I'm making jiaozi for you.

270
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,920
Jiaozi, look.

271
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,040
My lady,

272
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,800
the palace has sent a message again.

273
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,320
You are summoned by the Empress Dowager.

274
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,120
You're going to the palace more frequently

275
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,480
than I am these days.

276
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,200
Got it.

277
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
Then I will get changed now.

278
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,520
I will finish this when I get back.

279
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,240
Bye bye!

280
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

281
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,520
Get up.

282
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
Come closer now,

283
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,120
Lady Yan.

284
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

285
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,480
Today is the Winter Solstice,

286
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,480
I have sent them all home to celebrate

287
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,480
and asked only you to come here,

288
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,040
you won't blame me, Lady Yan, will you?

289
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,600
Of course not, Your Highness.

290
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,280
Come.

291
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,440
Sit down.

292
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
I heard

293
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,440
that Lord Lai

294
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,800
made a joke

295
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
with Lord Shen yesterday, right?

296
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,480
Yes.

297
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,560
Both of them

298
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,600
are my right-hand men.

299
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
You should advise Lord Shen

300
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
to avoid any conflicts

301
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,760
with Lai Luozhi.

302
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,680
It would be better if he just leave it be.

303
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

304
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,560
Although I am unaware of the details,

305
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,720
but my husband

306
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,600
is devoted

307
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,120
to serving Your Highness

308
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,360
and would never

309
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,440
act with any personal bias.

310
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,920
The snow should be falling soon.

311
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,440
The new year is approaching,

312
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,520
and I'm another year older.

313
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,000
You will endure, Your Highness.

314
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,760
It's fine.

315
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,480
Sit down. Sit.

316
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
There are

317
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,040
no other people in the palace today,

318
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,240
there's no need to be so formal.

319
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,320
I am

320
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,760
but a mortal being.

321
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,760
There's no such thing as eternity.

322
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,640
They respect me,

323
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,680
but they fear me more,

324
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,760
for in this vast palace,

325
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,280
no one

326
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,160
can stand beside me.

327
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,560
I see that Lord Zhang

328
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,560
and Lady Xu holds you

329
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,960
in high regard, Your Highness.

330
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,040
That's because I've been kind to them.

331
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
Your Highness,

332
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,960
you still have Princess Yong'an,

333
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,120
and Prince Xian,

334
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,200
they are

335
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600
all your children.

336
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,840
They

337
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,040
only have their eyes

338
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
on the

339
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,800
position of future Regent.

340
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,600
They eagerly await my passing

341
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
so they can seize power.

342
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
They've completely forgotten

343
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,280
their duties as my children.

344
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,040
Okay now,

345
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,080
enough about them.

346
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,280
I summoned you today

347
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,560
because I heard

348
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,480
Lord Shen had defended you fiercely.

349
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,080
And it reminded me of the late Emperor.

350
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,240
He also defended me like that.

351
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,640
He, a man

352
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,720
who always avoided conflict,

353
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,080
would stand against

354
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,600
the entire court for me.

355
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm getting old.

356
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,600
Truly.

357
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,960
Lately,

358
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,600
I've been reminiscing a lot.

359
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,440
Yan Xing,

360
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Lord Shen's love

361
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,520
for you runs deep,

362
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,600
making the marriage I once decreed

363
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,120
seem rather presumptuous.

364
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,360
That's not true, Your Highness.

365
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,080
Shen Du

366
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,960
holds you dear,

367
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,240
and it is precisely because of this

368
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,400
that I must remind you,

369
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,440
don't let anything cloud your judgment.

370
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,160
No matter what,

371
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,520
treasure the one who loves you truly.

372
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,640
I will remember that.

373
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,040
Si.

374
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,320
Lord Yan has asked you

375
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,680
to go back to the Yan residence.

376
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,440
My father?

377
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,040
Now?

378
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,520
Yes.

379
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,440
Please.

380
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,920
Xing,

381
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,360
come, come.

382
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,440
Lord Zhang has something to ask you.

383
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
You go ahead.

384
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,480
Lord Zhang,

385
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,000
we just met

386
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,800
each other at the banquet yesterday.

387
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,120
So why do you

388
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,560
specially come to the Yan residence

389
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
to see me today?

390
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,800
I heard that these days

391
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,480
you're often summoned to the palace

392
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
and highly favored by the Empress Dowager.

393
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,000
Lord Zhang, you flatter me.

394
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,200
Her Highness

395
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,520
just wanted to chat with me,

396
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,760
to talk about everyday matters.

397
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,440
To have the opportunity to chat with

398
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,520
the Empress Dowager is a rare blessing

399
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,560
that many people would never experience.

400
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,680
You've survived many perils

401
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,960
by Shen Du's side

402
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,600
and now have Her Highness' favor,

403
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
it's truly remarkable.

404
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,600
Though you must be quite elated now,

405
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,920
do you still remember

406
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,480
why you were asked to marry Shen Du?

407
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,320
Today is the Winter Solstice,

408
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,360
I won't waste much more time with you.

409
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,560
Just tell me everything

410
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,880
the Empress Dowager discussed with you,

411
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,000
and what had happened

412
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,800
in Shen's Residence recently

413
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,280
without reservation.

414
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I don't know.

415
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
How dare you!

416
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,640
Lord Zhang, you've used my father and

417
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,640
my family to pressure me for a long time.

418
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,520
I did marry into Shen's Residence

419
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
in my sister's place,

420
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,880
but my focus

421
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,680
has solely been on solving cases and

422
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,680
working diligently for Her Highness.

423
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,000
I don't know anything about the rest,

424
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,440
and cannot know anything.

425
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,520
I hope you can understand, Lord Zhang.

426
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,040
Xing,

427
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
do you think just because you have the

428
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,000
favor of the Empress Dowager and Shen Du,

429
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,640
you can act with arrogance,

430
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,400
and that I can't

431
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,360
do anything to you

432
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,560
or to your family?

433
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,760
Imperial favor is fleeting.

434
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,160
Shen Du is in a precarious position.

435
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,920
Do you truly believe he can protect you

436
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,160
or your family?

437
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,520
I don't want to rely on anyone

438
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,560
but myself.

439
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,560
Good.

440
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
You've grown tough,

441
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,520
have you?

442
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,040
This time,

443
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,840
when my husband and I

444
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,400
went to investigate the masked spectre

445
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,440
and the Fire Moth Sect

446
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,480
in Gannan,

447
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,839
we also gathered much information

448
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,240
about the border regions

449
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,600
and uncovered

450
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,920
many unexpected stories.

451
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,560
Lord Zhang, would you

452
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,759
be interested in hearing one?

453
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,640
What are you trying to say?

454
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,720
Xing,

455
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,680
think before you speak!

456
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,600
If you don't want to hear it, Lord Zhang,

457
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,200
then I won't tell.

458
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,359
However, as I was

459
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,040
reviewing the case files today,

460
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,720
I had a question.

461
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,880
Why is there no petition from you

462
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,720
regarding the old case of the Shen family?

463
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,000
How could you have no stance on this case?

464
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,839
On the public side,

465
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,440
you were already a crucial court official.

466
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:10,640
On the private side,

467
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,360
weren't you

468
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,480
a classmate of Shen Bingzhu?

469
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,200
What are you trying to say?

470
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,360
What do you know?

471
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,600
I don't know anything,

472
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,360
or what I should or shouldn't know.

473
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,760
How dare you threaten me

474
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,440
without any evidence?

475
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,280
Lord Zhang, if you had any questions,

476
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,040
you could have just come to my residence.

477
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,680
Don't you think it's a bit inappropriate

478
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,840
to come all the way to the Yan residence

479
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,560
and bother my wife?

480
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,040
Lord Zhang, I thought

481
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,920
you were a paragon of integrity

482
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
and disdained the corrupt bureaucracy.

483
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,600
How is it that you've now resorted

484
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,560
to threatening a woman?

485
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,040
I bid you farewell.

486
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,520
Xing.

487
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,680
Mom.

488
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,040
Caiwei, Yijiao, Mojie.

489
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,920
What are you all doing here?

490
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,640
Here.

491
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,080
Your father, that old fool,

492
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,040
has no backbone.

493
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,240
He only causes trouble for you.

494
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,600
You came back for the Winter Solstice

495
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,640
and left without even eating.

496
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,320
I know

497
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
you must be feeling aggrieved.

498
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,400
Yeah.

499
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,720
Mother and your mom made steamed rice cake

500
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,320
and jiaozi for you and Lord Shen.

501
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,040
They've already reheated it

502
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,480
several times waiting for you.

503
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,880
Your mom almost broke into tears

504
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,360
when she heard you are leaving hastily.

505
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,760
Mom,

506
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,320
I'm sorry.

507
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
You have nothing to be sorry about.

508
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,320
It's all your father's fault.

509
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,480
This is your favorite

510
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,640
since you were little.

511
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,080
Xing, eat it

512
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,040
while it's still hot.

513
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,160
Thank you, Yijiao.

514
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,080
Thank you, Mojie.

515
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,000
Xing,

516
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,640
how have you been at the Shen residence?

517
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Everything's good.

518
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,960
That's good then.

519
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,640
I overheard Father talking with

520
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,320
Mojie and Shiyuan the other day,

521
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,840
and learned that the Empress Dowager

522
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,040
is favoring Lai Luozhi

523
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,560
and is suppressing Lord Shen.

524
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,200
But she keeps summoning you every day

525
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,760
as if she's trying to balance this out.

526
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,360
It's not that grave.

527
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Xing,

528
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,320
my advice remains the same.

529
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,720
If you and the White Death

530
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,280
can have a peaceful

531
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,600
and happy life together,

532
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,800
that's great.

533
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,480
But if you're constantly

534
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,880
living in fear

535
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,400
and danger,

536
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,160
it's better to return home.

537
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,520
After all,

538
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,640
there is always a place for you here.

539
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
Yeah.

540
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,880
Your mom might be blunt,

541
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,240
but it's all for your own good.

542
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,520
No matter what,

543
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,920
your happiness is the most important.

544
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,080
Please don't make

545
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,360
more sacrifices for our family.

546
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,280
Thank you, mom,

547
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,520
and everyone,

548
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,560
for your concern.

549
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,960
I'm doing well now.

550
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,360
Really well.

551
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,640
Then we can be at ease.

552
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,320
Right,

553
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,600
since it's the Winter Solstice,

554
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
and we have a rare day off,

555
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,320
how about

556
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,600
we stroll around the streets together?

557
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,720
He doesn't bite.

558
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,520
Then let's go.

559
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,760
Your family cares for you deeply.

560
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,000
Our family is very peaceful.

561
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
Though we might sometimes fight,

562
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,120
it always comes from good intentions.

563
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,440
I'm not sure

564
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,520
if this is my father's fortune

565
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,160
or a blessing for us,

566
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,560
his children.

567
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,280
It's a blessing for me.

568
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,360
My lost my parents early.

569
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,880
What I envy most

570
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,600
is a complete and happy family.

571
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,040
Actually, from the first time

572
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,600
I visited the Yan residence, I wondered

573
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,800
why you were so determined

574
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,480
to clear injustices for everyone.

575
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,480
It's because you grew up happily,

576
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,400
so your sense of justice is pure

577
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,240
and untainted.

578
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,360
From now on,

579
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,240
they are also your family.

580
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,640
My Lady.

581
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,880
Watch out.

582
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,400
Look how tender the Chief of the IG,

583
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
whom everyone fears,

584
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,600
is with his beloved wife.

585
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,120
What were you doing

586
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,040
with the Delinquent?

587
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,320
Xing,

588
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,400
you didn't know that

589
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,240
Lu Chuichui is going to

590
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,160
marry a Delinquent?

591
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,440
That's not true!

592
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,640
You and Jiang Langxing?

593
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,640
You two are together now?

594
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,120
Go on and laugh at me.

595
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,560
Why would I laugh at you?

596
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,920
I'm happy for you!

597
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,600
You finally figured it out!

598
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
How did you realize that

599
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,160
Jiang Langxing liked you?

600
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,320
I...

601
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,280
How did I realize it?

602
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,640
Because you are

603
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,960
beautiful, kind, and very smart,

604
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,520
of course.

605
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,480
Why the shyness?

606
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,240
I wanted to ask you

607
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,720
when you'll be holding the wedding.

608
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,280
I want to get married on the same day!

609
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,880
You are getting married too?

610
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,080
Who are you marrying?

611
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,240
Yan Xing,

612
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,160
have you become foolish from

613
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,440
working on cases too much?

614
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,720
Couldn't you tell?

615
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,440
I'm marrying Xiangren, of course.

616
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,120
Congratulations.

617
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,160
Thank you.

618
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,360
Shen Du,

619
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,920
I don't like you anymore.

620
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,520
So from now on,

621
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,960
you have to treat Xing well.

622
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,600
If you scare her away,

623
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,960
no woman will ever like you again.

624
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,360
You will never find a wife again.

625
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,680
So what?

626
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,160
Yan Xing

627
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,080
is the only woman I want.
