Melody of Golden Age EP40

3
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,240
I humbly request that Your Highness

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,920
mete out justice to Zhang Xingwei

5
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,800
but I also

6
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,080
implore you to consider his past merits

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,760
and show leniency to

8
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,400
the members of the Zhang Family.

9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
Your Royal Highness,

10
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,160
The members of the Zhangs have served

11
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,320
as Prime Minister for three generations,

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,960
contributing to the stability of the realm.

13
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,720
Lord Zhang's mistake should not implicate

14
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,560
the innocent members of the entire family.

15
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,080
Lord Shen,

16
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,480
is this really what you wish for?

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,080
I understand the pain of being imprisoned.

18
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
I only wish

19
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,280
for the truth to be revealed.

20
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,680
In the eighth year of the Shengli era,

21
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,960
Prime Minister Zhang Xingwei was

22
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
given poisoned wine and took his own life.

23
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,000
Prince Xian volunteered to guard the borders,

24
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,520
and would not return for a decade.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
The Jinxiufang Workshop case has been overturned.

26
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,840
Shen Bingzhu's treason case was retried.

27
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,920
The Zhou Family's implicated officials

28
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,240
have been sentenced,

29
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,680
with their kins

30
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,080
exiled for life

31
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,400
from Xiang'an.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,160
The Shen Family's name has been cleared.

33
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,080
Father,

34
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,160
mother,

35
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
I did it.

36
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,200
By the will of God,

37
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,200
we hereby declare:

38
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,960
Lord Shen Bingzhu

39
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
was wrongfully accused of treason.

40
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
It was indeed a miscarriage of justice.

41
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,880
Shen Du's loyalty is evident to all.

42
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
He's hereby awarded the medal for gallantry.

43
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,160
The implicated will be reinterred with full honors.

44
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,280
Their family will receive special privileges.

45
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,000
Uncle Shen,

46
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,920
are you seeing this?

47
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,000
He has proven the Shen Family's innocence.

48
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
He has succeeded.

49
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
So clever.

50
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,280
Good boy.

51
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Mother,

52
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,440
I've recognized my mistakes.

53
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,880
I humbly request punishment.

54
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,080
If I intend to punish you,

55
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
do I have to wait until now?

56
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Yongan,

57
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,320
I will not punish you, and it's not merely

58
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,720
because of our mother-daughter bond,

59
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,640
but because you only

60
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,680
provided support to the local garrisons,

61
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,880
which neither harms the empire

62
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
nor threatens the monarch.

63
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,840
If you had

64
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,239
even a hint of treasonous intent...

65
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,200
I would never dare to.

66
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:50,920
I have donated all my personal wealth

67
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,040
to the treasury,

68
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
and my fate is

69
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,320
in Your Royal Highness' hands.

70
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,120
You may rise.

71
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
Such a mistake

72
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,640
must be avoided in the future.

73
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,160
This lesson is etched in my heart.

74
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,280
Yongan,

75
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
do you think you could

76
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,400
secure the support from the provinces

77
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
by providing them

78
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,720
with arms and funds?

79
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,760
True loyalty

80
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,600
cannot be bought.

81
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,280
With your brother guarding the frontier,

82
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,080
isn't it time for you

83
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,680
to contribute to the empire

84
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
from Xiang'an?

85
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,440
I shouldn't have to remind you, right?

86
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
I will dedicate myself wholeheartedly

87
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,320
to supporting His Majesty.

88
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,600
That's good.

89
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
As the saying goes.

90
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
A regime prospers

91
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,600
by following the desires of its citizens,

92
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,880
and it collapses by

93
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,680
going against their hearts.

94
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,080
The people hate hardship and toil;

95
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,840
I will bring them ease and joy.

96
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,920
The people loathe poverty;

97
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,760
I will bring them wealth and honor.

98
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,160
Keep going, my dear!

99
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,320
The people fear danger;

100
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,960
I will ensure their safety and stability.

101
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,680
The people dread extinction;

102
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,200
I will nourish them to make them thrive.

103
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,360
Won... wonderful!

104
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,120
Qi has finally spoken!

105
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,800
Qi!

106
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,200
His Majesty has grown up!

107
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
He has truly grown up!

108
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
He can talk now!

109
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,040
He has finally spoken!

110
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,720
Auntie!

111
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
Look, look!

112
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
His Majesty has spoken!

113
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
Runing.

114
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,720
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

115
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Come on, get up, up!

116
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,560
This is a family gathering,

117
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,080
no need for formalities!

118
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,600
I have received the lily sachet

119
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,600
from Your Highness.

120
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,080
But I

121
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,840
prefer the night-blooming jasmine sachet.

122
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,360
Runing,

123
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,520
your choice not to give back the present

124
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,280
is a gesture of honor to me.

125
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,800
I'll keep it in mind, and I'll

126
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,720
send you a night-blooming jasmine sachet.

127
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,600
By the will of God,

128
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
we hereby declare: I've heard that

129
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,960
Yan Xing, Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice,

130
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
is both virtuous and talented,

131
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
and has solved many challenging cases.

132
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,640
I hereby promote her to the position of minister,

133
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,920
and I bestow upon her

134
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,480
a plaque inscribed in my own hand,

135
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,160
to honor her contributions.

136
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,160
By royal decree.

137
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm grateful for His Majesty's grace.

138
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Lady Yan, please rise.

139
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,520
We came to deliver the imperial decree,

140
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,720
but we circled Xiang'an City

141
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,800
for a while.

142
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,720
Initially, we went to the Shen residence,

143
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
but unexpectedly,

144
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,720
you were visiting the Yans.

145
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,680
Gratitude, my lord.

146
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
Hot tea has been prepared for you.

147
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,480
Please come in!

148
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,000
I must return to the palace,

149
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,320
so I won't disturb you any further.

150
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
Gratitude, my lord.

151
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,240
Please.

152
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,560
Xing,

153
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,040
you are remarkable!

154
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,520
Is there any increase in your salary?

155
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,720
This is an honor to the family.

156
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Truly an honor!

157
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,840
This enhances our family's prestige!

158
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
This is the first plaque personally

159
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,000
inscribed by His Majesty

160
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,760
since he ascended the throne!

161
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,640
Is that so?

162
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
When I've reached the end of my days,

163
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,400
I, Yan Kuo, will have the honor to meet

164
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,240
the ancestors of our Yan Family.

165
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,000
Father,

166
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,360
why are you saying such things

167
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
when everything seems fine?

168
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,240
Even though I wish

169
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,640
to keep this plaque in the Yan residence,

170
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
but in a few days,

171
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
you should still take it

172
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,680
back to the Shen residence.

173
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,560
Now that you are married,

174
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,760
what decorum is there in lingering here?

175
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,440
Father,

176
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
I have already divorced Shen Du.

177
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,760
What reason do I have to return there?

178
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,920
Is it possible that father

179
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,240
wishes to expel me?

180
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
Look,

181
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,960
how could I possibly mean that?

182
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,640
Couples fight,

183
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
but they always find a way to reconcile.

184
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,120
It's not beneficial to remain

185
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,600
stuck in this stalemate,

186
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,360
don't you agree?

187
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,440
Hey,

188
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,400
look at her,

189
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,160
well,

190
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,200
After the promotion,

191
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,760
her temper has grown even worse.

192
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,400
My lord, my lord!

193
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,400
Congratulations, my lord!

194
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Best wishes, my lord!

195
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,760
Your salary has increased by ten percent!

196
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,040
That doesn't really matter.

197
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,080
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
Wealth is but a fleeting possession.

199
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,880
As an official, I, Wu Taiming,

200
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,400
do not seek fame or fortune.

201
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,640
My aspiration lies

202
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,600
in cultivating myself,

203
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,600
leading my family with honor, and

204
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,520
contributing to the welfare of the state.

205
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Right, right,

206
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,720
you are absolutely right, my lord.

207
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,360
However, let's not forget,

208
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,080
your award is

209
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,680
a recognition of

210
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
your noble character,

211
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,440
right?

212
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,600
you see,

213
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,920
think back to when

214
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,800
Lord Shen

215
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
and Lady Yan

216
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,360
were in grave danger.

217
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,200
Everyone else shied away,

218
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,920
but you, my lord, you

219
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,880
stepped forward without hesitation.

220
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,400
You faced the danger head-on to help them!

221
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,640
I, Feng Gui, am

222
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,440
utterly in awe of you,

223
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,360
in awe of you!

224
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,280
My lord...

225
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,200
Feng boy,

226
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,040
do you know the reason behind my act?

227
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,960
I don't know.

228
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,120
I've served as an official for two decades,

229
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,280
and the most valuable lesson I've learned

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
is...

231
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,920
What is it?

232
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,440
Please enlighten me!

233
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,280
Cooking on new stoves!(Align with those who have potential.)

234
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,680
About new stoves,

235
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,960
how to nurture the flames,

236
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,360
when to light the new stoves;

237
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,880
it's actually an art.

238
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,880
Cooking on new stoves?

239
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,560
Feng boy...

240
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,840
Qi Yeyun, the new constable,

241
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
reporting for duty.

242
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Yeyun?

243
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,320
Yes, I am.

244
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,640
I am Feng Gui,

245
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,000
the squad leader of the constables.

246
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,960
Come, come, everyone,

247
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200
put down your work.

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,120
Come on, gather around,

249
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,920
let's welcome the new guy!

250
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,760
Hurry up!

251
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,600
Come on.

252
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,120
Come on, double time!

253
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,520
I, er...

254
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,880
We're delighted to

255
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,360
welcome you to

256
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,600
join our family at

257
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,760
the Constables' Office.

258
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,880
Welcome aboard!

259
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
Welcome, welcome.

260
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,760
Cooking on a new stove, huh?

261
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,360
Alright, alright, get to work.

262
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,440
Qi Yeyun

263
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
already calls Lord Shen brother-in-law,

264
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
so he's definitely an old stove.

265
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,680
What's there to cook over there?

266
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,440
You still have a lot to learn!

267
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,080
This is good.

268
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Feels good, huh, father?

269
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,680
Absolutely!

270
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,800
Is there any way I wouldn't enjoy

271
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,000
my daughter's massage?

272
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,080
Father,

273
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,320
this worker is giving it his all,

274
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,680
wouldn't you say?

275
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,600
He certainly works hard.

276
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,760
This is commendable.

277
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Sweetie,

278
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,919
our pawnshop has been

279
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,199
losing workers one after another.

280
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,240
It's a never-ending cycle.

281
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,040
Thankfully,

282
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,320
I have a diligent and hardworking

283
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,040
son-in-law now.

284
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,159
Langxing,

285
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,880
come, sit down and take a break;

286
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,679
enjoy a cup of tea with us.

287
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,679
I've fine.

288
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,520
I have plenty of energy,

289
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,280
so I'm not tired at all.

290
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:47,960
Langxing,

291
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,480
I think you could really use

292
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,280
a set of armor that's made of gold!

293
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,360
How about this,

294
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,920
I'll order a set for you!

295
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,240
No, really, I'm OK.

296
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
You already gifted me

297
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,760
a hat of gold last time.

298
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,840
It's really not necessary.

299
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,360
Don't say no.

300
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Let me tell you,

301
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,320
An armor made of gold

302
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,440
would suit you perfectly!

303
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,840
Oh... this...

304
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,560
It's far too extravagant!

305
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,760
I truly can't accept such a gift.

306
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,800
Are you taking it or not?

307
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,520
Yes, I will...

308
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,680
That's more like it.

309
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
Don't refuse Father's gift!

310
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,720
What she said makes perfect sense,

311
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,640
gifts from the elders

312
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,640
should never be turned down.

313
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,840
Exactly.

314
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,720
Yes,

315
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,120
I... I'll return to work now...

316
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Your Royal Highness,

317
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,280
the renovation of the Ming Hall

318
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,160
has been successfully completed.

319
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
The composition by Mr. Jin for the

320
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,520
Ming Hall is close to completion,

321
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,080
with only the ending left to finish.

322
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,640
I have asked the palace musicians

323
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,360
to complete the last part of the melody.

324
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,960
I pray it brings Your Highness pleasure.

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Wonderful!

326
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,920
I feel completely reassured with you

327
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
overseeing things, Lord Shen.

328
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,560
This piece still lacks a title.

329
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,600
I humbly request

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,720
Your Highness to bestow a title upon it.

331
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,720
With all things prepared

332
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,440
for everlasting happiness,

333
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,320
let's call it the "Melody of Golden Age!"

334
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,200
I envision that on the day

335
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,400
the Ming Hall reopens,

336
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,720
I'd like to invite the people of Xiang'an

337
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
to come in and visit,

338
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,880
to share in the joy

339
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,480
and appreciate the

340
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,600
"Melody Of Golden Age!"

341
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,680
Lord Shen,

342
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,400
my lady mentioned that,

343
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,920
now that you've divorced,

344
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
it's best not to disturb her.

345
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,120
I humbly request you to leave now.

346
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Farewell.

347
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,400
Lord Shen,

348
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,120
this marks the ninth time

349
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,520
you've been turned away.

350
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,280
I think...

351
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,040
I think

352
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,200
the gift isn't impressive enough,

353
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,560
not heartfelt enough.

354
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,120
Xing,

355
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
he's already visited nine times.

356
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,040
He is genuinely sincere.

357
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,680
Don't hold a grudge against him.

358
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,000
Just go home with him.

359
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,240
That's right, Xing,

360
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,440
a respectable commander

361
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
stands at our gate all day,

362
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,760
and this doesn't

363
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,120
reflect well on us.

364
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,800
You should show your husband some respect.

365
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,480
Mother,

366
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,680
sister,

367
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,600
why are you all

368
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
defending him?

369
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,520
He's the one who insisted on the divorce.

370
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,960
I'm merely honoring his choice.

371
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Besides,

372
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,760
I never asked him

373
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
to linger at our door all day.

374
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,200
Hey, where are you going?

375
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,200
Food!

376
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm hungry, mother.

377
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
I'll go prepare some food for you.

378
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,880
Easy, you!

379
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,920
Be careful with your child!

380
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Jing Lin, let's go

381
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,960
change the betrothal gifts again.

382
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,520
Is that for real?

383
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,760
Word has traveled across Xiang'an City.

384
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,560
Lord Shen has been rejected nine times.

385
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,640
And he's eagerly going to

386
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,920
propose to Xing for the tenth time!

387
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,320
It's just hilarious!

388
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,080
Isn't that Lord Shen over there?

389
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,120
He should be called "White Gift (in vain)"

390
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,640
instead of "The White Death!"

391
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,320
Will this tenth attempt succeed?

392
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,880
They seem to have bought quite some gifts,

393
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,080
and they look quite lavish.

394
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,320
-This time it should work, right? -My lord.

395
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,880
I have purchased the trendiest earrings

396
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,240
and hairpins, each in a complete set.

397
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,880
You carry them.

398
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,560
I...

399
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
I really can't carry all of this!

400
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,400
Why didn't you ask more

401
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,200
people to come and help?

402
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,880
The Imperial Guard has plenty of manpower.

403
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,360
What do you know?

404
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,600
The less known, the better.

405
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,320
Is there a single soul in Xiang'an

406
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,200
who hasn't heard?

407
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
No one knows, no one knows...

408
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,680
We support you, Lord Shen!

409
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,480
May you soon embrace your beloved!

410
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,960
No one knows, no one knows...

411
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,040
You have our blessing!

412
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,360
Lord Shen, go for it!

413
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,680
Well,

414
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,440
all the young men in Xiang'an City

415
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
should take him as a cautionary example!

416
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,920
It's imperative they learn

417
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,360
not to displease their wives!

418
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,040
Your Royal Highness,

419
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,680
Lady Yan has arrived.

420
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,040
Let her in.

421
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes.

422
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,160
She's here.

423
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,200
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

424
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
You may rise.

425
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,360
Come closer.

426
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,360
Let's chat.

427
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,040
I summoned you here for two reasons.

428
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,160
First,

429
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,040
the festival season has arrived.

430
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,120
And both I and Lady Xu

431
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,240
would like to catch up with you.

432
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
Secondly,

433
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,920
I have some good news to share.

434
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,880
Her Royal Highness has issued a decree

435
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,800
to change the method

436
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,000
of selecting officials

437
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,560
from "inheritance" to "merit-based."

438
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,400
From now on, regardless the background,

439
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,240
everyone will have a fair opportunity

440
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,440
to pursue their goals

441
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,560
and serve the empire.

442
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,400
All the students from humble backgrounds

443
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,120
will surely appreciate Your Highness'

444
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
recognition of their talents and

445
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,640
study diligently to serve the empire.

446
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,760
You may enter.

447
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,560
Next.

448
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,920
Lift your arms.

449
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,000
Enter.

450
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,920
Turn around.

451
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,600
Good.

452
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,440
Pan Chi!

453
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,320
It's really you!

454
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,720
What?

455
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
Can't I take the exam?

456
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,720
Of course you can!

457
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
We welcome candidates from

458
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,520
all over the empire to take the exam.

459
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,280
How come I heard that

460
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,520
someone

461
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,480
isn't interested in becoming an official?

462
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
One becomes red by being close to red (Pig),

463
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,960
and black by being close to ink!

464
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,920
The way you're speaking now

465
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,120
is increasingly resembling Lu Chuichui.

466
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,880
Are you implying that Chui is ink?

467
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm saying she's the pig (red).

468
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,040
You!

469
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm not interested in being an official.

470
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,720
I simply need to use

471
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,200
this exam to prove myself

472
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,120
and also to see if

473
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,000
your exam

474
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,720
is genuinely fair.

475
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,200
Alright,

476
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,560
Then make sure to take the exam seriously

477
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,320
and evaluate it thoroughly.

478
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,480
There are certain things

479
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,560
I have long wished to do.

480
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
It's just that for a long time,

481
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,360
I haven't found the right moment.

482
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
In my heart,

483
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,800
I have never forgotten Chen Baiyi.

484
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,800
Yan Xing speaks on behalf of Chen Baiyi

485
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
and the students from humble backgrounds

486
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,760
to express their gratitude to Your Highness.

487
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,760
Lady Yan,

488
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
you always think of others,

489
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,160
but it's important to

490
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,280
prioritize your own needs as well.

491
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,880
Me?

492
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,520
What needs might that be?

493
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,600
Look, I'm

494
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,720
providing opportunities for the students.

495
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,720
What about you?

496
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,280
Shouldn't you also

497
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,440
give those around you

498
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,800
a chance to retake the exam?

499
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,640
As the saying goes,

500
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,880
"better to cherish the one who is near."

501
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,560
Wakey, wakey.

502
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,360
Mother is here for you.

503
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,040
Mother.

504
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,840
Why are you waking me up so early?

505
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,240
Today is my day off.

506
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,120
Get up and get dressed,

507
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,800
or the ceremony will be delayed.

508
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,960
What ceremony?

509
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,320
Everyone, come in,

510
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,560
and set everything down properly.

511
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,640
Be careful!

512
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,840
Yes, my lady.

513
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,800
Caiwei, easy.

514
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,560
Everything is ready.

515
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,440
Put this over there.

516
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,320
Yes.

517
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
Be quick.

518
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,960
Easy, don't break anything.

519
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,520
Be careful, place it gently.

520
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,640
Mother!

521
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
What's going on?

522
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,760
Here's the thing,

523
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,240
I went to the ancestral hall

524
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,640
to consult our ancestors,

525
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,200
and then went to see a fortune teller.

526
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
They all said that you,

527
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,000
having entered into a marriage

528
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,280
without proper rites,

529
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,080
and then inexplicably

530
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
going through a divorce.

531
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,560
You have committed a great disrespect,

532
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,040
and violated a serious taboo.

533
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,800
You have deceived our ancestors,

534
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,480
and also deceived God.

535
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,520
In the future,

536
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,120
you will face calamities!

537
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,120
Mother!

538
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,040
So you are saying that

539
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,600
even God doesn't allow me to divorce?

540
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,640
No, no.

541
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,920
I've thought it through,

542
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,600
If you want a divorce, then fine!

543
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,120
But to break this calamity,

544
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
the only way is to

545
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,320
go through the wedding ceremony

546
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,120
seriously once again.

547
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,920
After registering with God,

548
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,040
then you can get a proper divorce!

549
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Right, Xing,

550
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
I've also consulted the fortune teller.

551
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,200
This calamity is not only bad for you,

552
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,800
but also for our Yan Family.

553
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,760
I'm a bit scared too.

554
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Yeah, Xing,

555
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,680
look,

556
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,760
Caiwei is still pregnant.

557
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,880
It's safer to

558
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,680
trust this than

559
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,840
to question it.

560
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,760
To find happiness in life,

561
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,160
one must be with their beloved,

562
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,040
treating each other

563
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,640
with respect and

564
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,200
cherishing one another.

565
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,640
From now on,

566
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
you will no longer be alone.

567
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,080
I will definitely strive

568
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,520
to help you uncover the truth.

569
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,920
This virtuous lady is

570
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,840
none other than me!

571
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,720
Seducing me?

572
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,680
I'm out of your league.

573
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,480
Snatch the bride?

574
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Can it really work?

575
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Of course.

576
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
What are you doing?

577
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
The wedding is about to start!

578
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,560
Who said he wanted to hold a

579
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,520
sincere wedding

580
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,280
for my best friend?

581
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,160
Having second thoughts?

582
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Of course not.

583
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,320
I fear that I might get scolded by my wife

584
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,040
for acting without permission...

585
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,040
Why are you even more rigid

586
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,200
than my poker face?

587
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,560
What's there to fear about being scolded?

588
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,240
You should worry that she might ignore you.

589
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,320
Lord Shen,

590
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,520
when it comes to getting married,

591
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,200
you should have the courage

592
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,240
to risk everything and

593
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,080
not give up until you succeed.

594
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,480
Lord Shen,

595
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
congratulations,

596
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,480
my wife mentioned,

597
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,960
although Xing is reluctant,

598
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,960
she still sat down to prepare herself.

599
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,680
Lord Shen,

600
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,920
don't you see?

601
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,800
My lady is

602
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,040
incredibly clever.

603
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,880
How could she not realize

604
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,760
that this is all a setup?

605
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,400
Since she's willing to prepare herself,

606
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,040
it clearly shows that in her heart,

607
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,240
she must be willing to do it.

608
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,960
Exactly.

609
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,640
The dignified Lord Shen

610
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,720
is not as quick-witted

611
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
as your subordinate.

612
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Lord Shen,

613
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,720
charge!

614
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,640
Let's go!

615
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,480
My love,

616
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,480
I have come to take you home!

617
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,320
Alright,

618
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,200
let me see.

619
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,640
So gorgeous!

620
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,320
Truly worthy of being my daughter,

621
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,280
so radiant!

622
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,440
Like a flower, like jade,

623
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,920
I just can't get enough of you!

624
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,520
She looks just like me!

625
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,080
Mother!

626
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,840
Please...

627
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

628
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,160
have you figured out

629
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,440
the answer to the riddle?

630
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,799
"A line of white egrets flying in the sky."

631
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,880
Congratulations,

632
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
you got the last riddle correctly.

633
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,640
Fortunately, I, Lu Chuichui, is here,

634
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,440
otherwise, with you muscle-heads,

635
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,560
we wouldn't finish before dark.

636
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,400
Yes, yes.

637
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,680
You're absolutely right.

638
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,120
Our Yan Family is a scholarly family.

639
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,799
If one wishes to marry

640
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:06,560
a lady from our family,

641
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,440
they must possess exceptional talent.

642
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,520
Now, for the next round,

643
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,799
you must compose a poem

644
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
to express your affection.

645
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,680
It seems that Lord Shen has

646
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,840
advanced to the second round.

647
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,400
Caiwei's poetry exam

648
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,759
is not an easy hurdle to overcome.

649
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,920
Sick with wine before flowers,

650
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,000
I don't avoid the mirror's fading face.

651
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,040
From dawn to dusk, watching the clouds.

652
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,000
Whether walking or sitting,

653
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,520
I think of you! (Xing).

654
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
Alone on a bridge, the wind fills my sleeves.

655
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,640
In the quiet woods, the moon appears.

656
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,120
Who can share the joys of life with me?

657
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,080
Fortunately, I have met you,

658
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,560
so I (Du) can return home!

659
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,840
Thank you for your timely rescue.

660
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,520
Your ears are all red from the cold.

661
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
What are you doing?

662
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,120
I just want everyone to see

663
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,880
that we have a harmonious marriage.

664
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,200
Xing girl,

665
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
I think you should just step outside.

666
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,920
The poems he made

667
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,360
are so awful,

668
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,560
they could make me nauseous.

669
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,480
Yeah, Xing,

670
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,240
just stop him.

671
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,960
We're all at this age,

672
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,520
so we can't handle the torment!

673
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,440
Good poems,

674
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,720
with brilliant literary talent,

675
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,480
you've passed the second round!

676
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,840
Please, my lord.

677
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,560
The last round

678
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,480
is a martial arts competition.

679
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,200
If you want to marry my sister,

680
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,960
fine!

681
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,760
But first, you have to defeat both of us.

682
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,920
Or, you can forget about taking sis.

683
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,960
My lord,

684
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,040
you've got this round secured.

685
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,160
-Don't move! -What's this for?

686
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
My lord, hurry and go!

687
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,440
This is completely unfair.

688
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,880
Asking Mojie and

689
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,400
a lad to take on him,

690
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,760
is this even a challenge?

691
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,440
How about I compete with him in dancing?

692
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,600
You lost!

693
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,440
What?

694
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,320
They...

695
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,440
defeated Shen Du?

696
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,760
I think he was deliberately losing.

697
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Oh no, Xing,

698
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,720
Shen Du lost,

699
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,360
and he is leaving in a huff

700
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,560
with the wedding procession!

701
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,480
Shen Du,

702
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,840
you are still here?

703
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,160
My love, you are here,

704
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,600
where could I possibly be?

705
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,040
Well done, Shen Du,

706
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,040
putting on such a grand act to deceive me!

707
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,880
I...

708
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm foolish,

709
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,880
unable to win over such a clever wife.

710
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,840
So I could only put on a show.

711
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,400
You won't hold it against me, will you?

712
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,840
This shall not be repeated.

713
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,920
May you have a son soon!

714
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Wishing you a century of harmony!

715
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,040
My love,

716
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,080
shall we go home?

717
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,840
Let's go home!
