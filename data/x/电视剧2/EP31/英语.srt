00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:45,020
Melody of Golden Age EP31

3
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,160
Unlimited funds do not mean

4
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,760
that corruption can go unchecked

5
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,160
and enrich themselves.

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,480
How much are we talking about?

7
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,560
It could shake the entire court.

8
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,600
They have completely angered

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,720
the Great Grandmother.

10
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,160
This matter implicates many,

11
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,720
and the silence now suggests

12
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,320
that the Great Grandmother

13
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,680
plans to investigate secretly,

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
to eradicate the evil completely,

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,520
and destroy them for good.

16
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,520
So, what should

17
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,960
we do now?

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,920
Your husband,

19
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,600
disregarding the royal family's face,

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,520
has rejected the arranged marriage,

21
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,920
and may be put to

22
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,240
an indifferent post.

23
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,240
My dear wife,

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,320
you won't despise me for this, will you?

25
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,480
Your intention

26
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,840
is too clear

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
to hide from me.

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,560
But my feelings for you can be seen

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
by the heaven and earth.

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
The Great Grandmother's given an oral decree

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,120
to have the Imperial Guard

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,080
investigate Princess Runing

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,960
and Prince Xian,

34
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,800
and to spy on the Imperial Inspectorate.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
Is the Great Grandmother

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,280
suspecting Prince Xian?

37
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,120
More than him, I'm afraid.

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,920
The decree of the Great Grandmother.

39
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
The Imperial Inspectorate

40
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
is ordered to probe Zhou's kin secretly,

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,040
and watch Princess Ying's moves,

42
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,680
reporting truthfully

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
without concealment.

44
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,280
Additionally,

45
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,080
secretly monitor the IG,

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,760
and report immediately

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
for anomalies.

48
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,840
Yes,

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
your servant accepts the decree.

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,680
Lady Xu,

51
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,079
I have prepared

52
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,760
the famous tea from Junshan Island,

53
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
brewed with snow water from Tianshan.

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,920
You might as well stay and taste it.

55
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,360
The nature of this tea is too cold

56
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
for me to enjoy.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,720
Lord Lai, there's no need to see me off.

58
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,520
The decree of the Great Grandmother

59
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,240
must be handled with utmost care,

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
fairness,

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,240
and without error.

62
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
Yes,

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,280
thank you for the reminder, Lady Xu.

64
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,240
A fine tea indeed.

65
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,600
Shen Du's got some nerve,

66
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,800
daring to refuse the empress

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
dowager's arranged marriage.

68
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,120
It seems I've underestimated Yan Xing.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,840
How intriguing.

70
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,480
I never expected

71
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
the cold-hearted Shen Du

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,760
to actually fall in love.

73
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,640
Nonetheless,

74
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,760
this is a good thing

75
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,080
for us.

76
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,000
If Princess Ying gains

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,120
the support of the IG,

78
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,320
it will be much more difficult

79
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,520
for you to secure

80
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,760
the position of regent.

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,880
Don't you find it strange

82
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,960
that the empress dowager didn't

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
punish Shen Du severely?

84
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,760
With Mo Qianzhi's death,

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,000
the position of the governor of Yingzhou

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
has been vacant.

87
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,120
I've heard that

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,400
someone tried to assassinate Shen Du

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,560
before returning to Xiang'an,

90
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
and then he met

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
the empress dowager in the nightfall,

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
after which

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,640
the arranged marriage was proposed.

94
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Too coincidental.

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,120
I wonder what information

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,960
he might have discovered in Yingzhou.

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,200
Shen Du might have

98
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,880
distanced himself from Great Grandmother

99
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,640
due to the arranged marriage issue,

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,920
and recently he's rarely been summoned.

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,760
I've heard that

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,840
some maids have reached the age

103
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,400
to return to their hometowns,

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,320
and Great Grandmother

105
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,360
called Lai Luozhi

106
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,480
and bestowed upon him several maids.

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,760
It's clear to everyone that

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,160
Lai Luozhi is now favored

109
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,360
by the empress dowager.

110
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,640
It seems inevitable that the Imperial Inspectorate

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,480
will outshine the IG.

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,760
It's too early to draw conclusions.

113
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,800
Zhang Baohuan's sudden serious illness

114
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,640
is quite suspicious.

115
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
I always feel

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,320
that something significant

117
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,960
is happening in the court.

118
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,080
Human hearts are inscrutable.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
I will send more people

120
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
to spy on monitor Princess Ying.

121
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,000
Lan,

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,920
he's on our side.

123
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
Men from Dacang cannot be trusted!

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,360
He's also trying to capture that person,

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,480
who not only deceived

126
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,440
the Holy Maiden Dai Si.

127
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
Do you trust him?

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,480
I trust him.

129
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,360
Here you are.

130
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,360
Thank you.

131
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,640
Thank you.

132
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
Lan,

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,920
you have served

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
Dai Si for many years.

135
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
We two wish to know

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
about the events of the past

137
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,960
in the most detailed way possible.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,160
It's been more than 10 years.

139
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
At that time, Dai Si

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
was the Jinwu Tribe's Holy Maiden.

141
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,080
Ever since Jinwu sent envoys

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,480
to pay respects to Dacang,

143
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,800
Dacang returned the gesture

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,320
by sending envoys to Jinwu.

145
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,840
Since then, the Jinwu Tribe and Dacang

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
have had mutual exchanges,

147
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,640
and the two peoples have been free to

148
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,760
come and go.

149
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
One day on the street,

150
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,760
as the Holy Maiden was blessing

151
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,800
and praying for the people,

152
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't worry, we have it for everyone.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,920
she encountered that person.

154
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,920
It was just a coincidental encounter.

155
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,280
She didn't pay much attention.

156
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,800
She soon forgot

157
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,680
about him after returning.

158
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,680
As a Holy Maiden,

159
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
she is bound to a life of solitude.

160
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
She locked her heart,

161
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,360
dedicated to her tribe.

162
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,440
But fate had other plans,

163
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
and they met again

164
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,080
not long after.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,520
This time, however,

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
it was at a court banquet

167
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,320
of the Jinwu Tribe.

168
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
How could it be such a coincidence?

169
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,280
The Holy Maiden,

170
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,720
cut off from men for long,

171
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,040
was innocent and virtuous.

172
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,320
But once love stirred,

173
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,200
she was like a wild horse broken free,

174
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,080
her feelings impossible to hide.

175
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
After the banquet,

176
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,880
as the envoys lingered,

177
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Dai Si,

178
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,320
leveraging her sanctity,

179
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,600
sought Dacang's envoys' company.

180
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,880
And all of this

181
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
was to get closer

182
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
to that Dacang man.

183
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,880
What is this?

184
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Dai Si.

185
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
That's your name.

186
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,880
Unexpectedly, the Dacang man

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,760
proposed to learn

188
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,560
the Jinwu language from her.

189
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
He had an

190
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
extraordinary talent for languages,

191
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,080
and in just a week or so,

192
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,160
he had picked it up quite well.

193
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,400
It was from that day on

194
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,440
that the Holy Maiden

195
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,160
learned his name.

196
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,080
Those three characters

197
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
should have been

198
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,160
etched in her memory.

199
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,840
But no matter what,

200
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
they remained a blur afterwards.

201
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,320
Their relationship blossomed rapidly,

202
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
and soon

203
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,920
they were deeply in love.

204
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,000
But she had her duties,

205
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,560
and she had to be

206
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
reserved in public.

207
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
But at that time,

208
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,080
in her heart and eyes,

209
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,480
there was only that Dacang man;

210
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,640
she had forgotten

211
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,440
all her responsibilities.

212
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
But this joy didn't last long,

213
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
and soon

214
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,520
something went wrong.

215
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,040
Would you accompany

216
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,440
me back to Dacang?

217
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,480
I know your status is special,

218
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,520
and meeting you has

219
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
used up all the luck in my life.

220
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,680
How could I dare to ask for more?

221
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,720
Yes,

222
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,280
I would.

223
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Of course I am willing to.

224
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,560
After that,

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
no one could find

226
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,840
the Holy Maiden anymore.

227
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,560
Some people claimed

228
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
to have seen her dressed in

229
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
the traditional dress of Dacang women,

230
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,040
riding a horse

231
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,240
towards Dacang with him!

232
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Jinwu Tribe wanted to avoid a scandal,

233
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,800
so they announced

234
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,000
the Holy Maiden had died of illness,

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,720
erasing her existence.

236
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,680
Jinwu ceased

237
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,360
all interactions with Dacang since then.

238
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,520
I had thought

239
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,880
that this man

240
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,280
would protect her

241
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
and they would live a loving life.

242
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,440
But I never expected

243
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,280
that soon after,

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,800
in this dilapidated house,

245
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,160
I found the Holy Maiden

246
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,080
on the brink of death!

247
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,320
Holy Maiden! Holy Maiden!

248
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,960
Holy Maiden!

249
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,040
How could this have happened?

250
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,200
I am no longer the Holy Maiden.

251
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,680
Holy Maiden,

252
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,800
come back with me.

253
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,400
Everything will get better.

254
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,120
It's too late.

255
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,640
Where is that person?

256
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,360
Where is he?

257
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,760
He deceived me,

258
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
tricked me into revealing

259
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,080
the secrets a Holy Maiden should keep,

260
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
and coaxed me into teaching him

261
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,360
how to control moths with powders.

262
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,400
I was so foolish.

263
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,760
How could I have trusted him?

264
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
When I discovered

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
his ill intentions,

266
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
his practice of the dark arts,

267
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,520
and his attempts to manipulate

268
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,480
others to do his bidding,

269
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,760
he wanted to kill me.

270
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,800
Holy Maiden! Holy Maiden!

271
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,120
Holy Maiden...

272
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,160
Too late,

273
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,960
it's all too late.

274
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,680
I am guilty of grave sins.

275
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,240
-I deserve to die. -No, no!

276
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,080
Holy Maiden!

277
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,280
This man truly

278
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
deserves a thousandfold punishment,

279
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,520
and even death is too lenient!

280
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,200
Calm down first.

281
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
We will eventually catch him

282
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,560
in his crimes

283
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,880
and expose them to the world.

284
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
Lan,

285
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,680
take a look at these portraits.

286
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,920
Do any of them resemble him?

287
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,920
This mole!

288
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,840
It's him!

289
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
It's that Dacang man!

290
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
It's him!

291
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,680
Have you found him?

292
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,360
Where is he?

293
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,920
Tell me!

294
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,200
-I'm going to kill him! -Lan,

295
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,040
leave it to us.

296
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,360
Rest assured,

297
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
I will make sure this man

298
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,880
pays the price he deserves

299
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,480
to honor the death of Dai Si.

300
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,880
If the Holy Maiden's spirit watches,

301
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,840
that evil man, laden with crimes,

302
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,680
will face his just deserts

303
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,560
and die unburied.

304
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,520
She once

305
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,640
saw the unfaithful man

306
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,120
teaching an incendiary spell

307
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,960
to burn a granary down.

308
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,640
She reprimanded him

309
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,400
for disregarding the people of Dacang,

310
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,320
but he mocked her, saying that

311
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,560
it was not him who disregarded

312
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,440
the people of Dacang,

313
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,440
but...

314
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,680
but the

315
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,360
Great Grandmother

316
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,680
of Dacang.

317
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,040
And it was her own kin,

318
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,840
the Zhou family, who ordered

319
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,160
the burning of the granary.

320
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,680
When Dai Si fled,

321
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,080
she stole the token of the transaction

322
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,520
between him

323
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,680
and the arsonist—

324
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,440
this very jade pendant.

325
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,080
Yan Xing,

326
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,560
I hope it's not too late.

327
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920
Great Grandmother,

328
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,240
your servant has a report.

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
What is the matter?

330
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,680
I wish to impeach

331
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,040
Chief Inspector Sun Tan of Gannan

332
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,200
for dereliction of duty.

333
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
In the case of the masked spectre,

334
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,200
Sun Tan led

335
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,520
Gannan's Delinquents

336
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
to offer support,

337
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,640
and I saw it firsthand.

338
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,520
Why blaming him when we should

339
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,480
give him credit where it's due?

340
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Great Grandmother,

341
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,040
the Imperial Inspectorate has gathered

342
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,600
much evidence of Sun Tan's

343
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,880
malfeasance and corruption.

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
Now, I present them one by one.

345
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,120
Please review them.

346
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,560
Dacang's law states

347
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,239
stealing what's not yours is theft,

348
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,479
those who steal from his duties

349
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,840
shall face punishment.

350
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,560
Bribe-takers

351
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,240
deserve hanging.

352
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,600
Sun Tan, using his post,

353
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,720
stole and colluded with bandits.

354
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,880
The evidence is solid.

355
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,160
I request Great Grandmother to allow me

356
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,600
to punish him according to the law.

357
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Great Grandmother,

358
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,480
under torture of the Imperial Inspectorate,

359
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,280
confessions might be forced.

360
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,800
Whether Sun Tan's crime

361
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,160
is severe enough for hanging,

362
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
please consider it thrice.

363
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,440
Lord Shen,

364
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,400
your IG

365
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,520
is famously known

366
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,840
as the Avici Hell,

367
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,800
with tortures

368
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,520
even harsher.

369
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Now you are showing mercy

370
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,200
in front of the court,

371
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,160
trying to protect Sun Tan.

372
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,240
What is the meaning of this?

373
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,680
Enough.

374
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,480
Today, I am a bit tired.

375
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,120
Leave the evidence,

376
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,160
and we will discuss it another day.

377
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,760
-Your servant takes his leave. -Your son takes his leave.

378
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Leave us.

379
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,480
Prince Xian...

380
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,040
When trimming branches and leaves,

381
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,920
one must be very careful

382
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,120
and not be distracted at all.

383
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,320
Well,

384
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,160
isn't it much better than before?

385
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,440
Prince Xian, you...

386
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,000
Prince Xian,

387
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,880
Lai Luozhi is domineering

388
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,840
in the court,

389
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,280
often arresting officials

390
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,320
on trumped-up charges,

391
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,160
and now he's trying to

392
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
interfere in Gannan.

393
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,960
When you

394
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,280
become the regent,

395
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,160
he will also be a great threat to you.

396
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,600
How about this?

397
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
I will have someone impeach him

398
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,720
at the court session tomorrow.

399
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,280
Lord Zhang,

400
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,560
withered leaves will eventually fall.

401
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,160
Can we stop the autumn wind,

402
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,600
stop the winter snow?

403
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,040
What do you mean?

404
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,440
Nothing.

405
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
Those folks from Xichen and Nanlang

406
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,560
are new in town, right?

407
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,200
Yes.

408
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,840
Lately, Dacang's been a hub

409
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
for talent from all over,

410
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,160
and these folks just

411
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,360
come to Xiang'an

412
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,320
for a living.

413
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,720
Recently,

414
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
keep your eyes peeled

415
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,720
during patrols.

416
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,520
Yes.

417
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,760
Your Highness,

418
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,920
it's Shen Du.

419
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,360
I'm just so frustrated.

420
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,680
That White Death had the audacity

421
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,360
to reject the arranged marriage,

422
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,120
making Princess Jia'an look bad.

423
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,680
You should

424
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
have taught him a lesson.

425
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
Shen Du,

426
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,440
just like his father,

427
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
cannot tell good from bad.

428
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,840
The Queen Mother meant well,

429
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
but he fails to see

430
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,600
the value of a strong backing.

431
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
You've known Jia'an

432
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,440
longer than I have,

433
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,120
so I understand

434
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,280
you're concerned for her.

435
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,400
But the royal family's

436
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,120
honor is paramount.

437
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,000
Queen Mother's been disrespected,

438
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
and Shen Du's future

439
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,000
won't be smooth sailing

440
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,080
even though we don't interfere.

441
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Xing,

442
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,200
you're a gem.

443
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,320
You're the Chief Clerk now,

444
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
yet still sorting files for me.

445
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,680
When I was just a clerk,

446
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,360
I don't remember you

447
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
ever turning your nose

448
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,040
up at me.

449
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Oh,

450
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,440
try this.

451
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,440
From Gannan?

452
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,400
It's sweeter than Xiang'an's.

453
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,160
Try one.

454
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,600
Gannan's honey

455
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,560
is exceptionally sweet.

456
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,880
The place's not just for preserves,

457
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,800
but also for human flesh, you know.

458
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,600
Yan Xing,

459
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
I hate you!

460
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,480
Lu Chuichui.

461
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,480
How dare you, Lu Chuichui,

462
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,440
having Yan help you

463
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,800
with your files?

464
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,720
What were you thinking?

465
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,080
It takes one

466
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,920
to know one, right?

467
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,520
I...

468
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,280
That's history now.

469
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Right, Chief Clerk Yan?

470
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,760
Chief Clerk Yan,

471
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
time has changed.

472
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,920
Now, we share equal

473
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,080
official ranks.

10474
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
Plus, you are Lord Shen's wife.

475
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,320
In the future, I'll have to

476
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,640
rely on you for more guidance.

477
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Mr. Wu, you flatter me.

478
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,840
Although I've been given

479
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
the title of Chief Clerk,

480
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm still under the Ministry of Justice

481
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,520
and will need your advice

482
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,400
on cases, Chief Clerk Wu.

483
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
In the future,

484
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,840
I'll need your guidance.

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,920
Of course. Of course.

486
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,360
Your bureaucratic talk

487
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,160
is making me sick.

488
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,120
Feng Gui.

489
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Sit. Sit.

490
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,160
Since you still

491
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
regard me as the Chief Clerk,

492
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,720
I will speak frankly with you

493
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
behind closed doors.

494
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,360
Now you're

495
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
both the wife of Chief Shen

496
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,680
and have been promoted,

497
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,240
you claimed your fame

498
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,560
among all female officials.

499
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,480
But as the old saying goes:

500
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,920
the higher you rise, the harder you fall.

501
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,320
Do you know that

502
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,840
the Empress Dowager

503
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,640
now favors the Dark Demon

504
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,200
and disregards the White Death?

505
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,360
You...

506
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,480
The wives of other high-ranking officials

507
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,720
are good at acting and diplomatic,

508
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,680
so they can

509
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,120
gather useful secrets for their husbands.

510
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,200
Unlike you,

511
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,240
who are always

512
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,360
buried in case files and the mortuary

513
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,760
like a clueless fool.

514
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,760
Here's what I mean.

515
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,920
Chancellor Lai is powerful

516
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,160
and has been

517
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,360
frequently arresting court officials.

518
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
And the Empress Dowager's

519
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
favoritism towards him

520
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,960
exceeds that of Zhang Baohuan.

521
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,440
Whenever he requests an arrest,

522
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,120
the Empress Dowager always approves.

523
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,840
Every court official

524
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,400
is on the edge now.

525
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Is he domineering like this?

526
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
So,

527
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,880
Xing,

528
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,080
think about it,

529
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,640
how could the Dark Demon

530
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,840
possibly tolerate

531
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,440
the existence of the White Death,

532
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,240
who's his equal.

533
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,600
If I were

534
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,040
in his position,

535
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,000
I would also prefer

536
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,200
to have only one

537
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,200
Lord of Hell in this world.

538
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,000
Thank you for your kind reminder.

539
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,520
The more

540
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,720
I know my husband,

541
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,400
the more I realize

542
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,800
that despite his high position,

543
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,120
he's constantly walking a tightrope.

544
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
I don't know much about court politics

545
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,640
or how to help him,

546
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,920
so I just focus on my duties

547
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,680
and hope

548
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,920
not to cause him trouble.

549
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,160
You?

550
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,480
You won't cause trouble?

551
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,560
Lai Luozhi disregards life like this,

552
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,800
is no one going to do anything?

553
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,640
What's going on?

554
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,520
-What's going on? -Chief Xu?

555
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,480
If the Ministry of Justice won't act,

556
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,240
then I will go to the palace

557
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
and ask the Empress Dowager!

558
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,360
Isn't there law

559
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,760
in Dacang?

560
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,760
You! Shut your mouth!

561
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,240
-Move along, move along! -Move along!

562
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,600
Keep it like that if you want your death,

563
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,560
but don't get Ministry of Justice involved

564
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,480
and get so many of us wounded

565
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,240
midnight as well.

566
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,440
Xiangren,

567
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,120
what happened?

568
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,720
Lai Luozhi arrested Sun Tan.

569
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Sun Tan?

570
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,360
Chief Sun of the Delinquents of Gannan?

571
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,880
Wasn't his case file

572
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,040
delivered to the Supreme Court

573
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,480
after court was adjourned today?

574
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,320
The Empress Dowager hasn't decided yet.

575
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,040
Why Imperial Inspectorate started arrests?

576
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,840
She hasn't given a verdict yet,

577
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,800
and the Inspectorate already arrested him.

578
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,680
But we all know

579
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,320
what it's like

580
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,760
in the prison of the Inspectorate.

581
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,240
If it continues like this,

582
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,040
Sun Tan probably would not

583
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,200
live to see

584
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,840
the Empress Dowager's verdict.

585
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,760
Chancellor Lai has been

586
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,680
domineering long in the court.

587
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,560
At the end of the day,

588
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
it's the business of the Supreme Court.

589
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,400
You're barking up the wrong tree

590
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,560
here at the Ministry of Justice.

591
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,640
Is it your first day to know

592
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,680
ministers of the Supreme Court?

593
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,240
They've always been timid cowards.

594
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,040
Since it was the Inspectorate

595
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,480
that started the case against Sun Tan

596
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,960
and the Delinquents are also involved,

597
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
they've already

598
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,080
handed it over

599
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,000
to the Ministry of Justice.

600
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,680
The Supreme Court... I...

601
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,240
My head hurts!

602
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,920
Feng Gui.

603
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,080
I'm here. I'm here.

604
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,960
What's wrong with you now?

605
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,960
Mr. Wu, take your time to recover.

606
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,080
If the Ministry of Justice

607
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,160
cannot deliver justice for Sun Tan,

608
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm prepared

609
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,240
to go to the palace again.

610
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
Be careful. Be careful.

611
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,560
Let's go. Let's go.

612
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,880
Chief Clerk Wu

613
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,400
is not much bolder than

614
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
the ministers of the Supreme Court.

615
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,400
I think you've come to the wrong person.

616
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,320
Yun Que,

617
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,280
what are you doing here with Mr. Xu?

618
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,120
I'm a Delinquent too.

619
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
Why can't I be here with Mr. Xu?

620
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,680
Go back to your work.

621
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,760
Yes, sir.

622
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll take my leave.

623
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,120
Xiangren,

624
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,800
you've always

625
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,720
been straightforward

626
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,680
and outspoken,

627
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,040
so why are you

628
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,640
being so cautious today?

629
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,440
Xiangren, did you forget

630
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
that I'm also

631
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,400
the Chief Clerk

632
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,840
of the Ministry of Justice now?

633
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,240
With my rank,

634
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,520
I have the same authority

635
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
as Chief Clerk Wu to oversee cases.

636
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,680
I can apply to

637
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
preside over Sun Tan's case.

638
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,880
What did I say?

639
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,440
You should've asked Xing for help.

640
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,280
Xing,

641
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
this would be a blatant offense

642
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
to Lai Luozhi.

643
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,240
Didn't you say

644
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,880
you wouldn't cause trouble for Shen Du?

645
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,920
Yeah,

646
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,240
I did say that.

647
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,080
Xing,

648
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,360
I know

649
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,720
the court is full of schemes now, and

650
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Her Majesty is hard to read,

651
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,200
so Shen Du's life must be tough either.

652
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,440
You should

653
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,800
stay out of this.

654
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,160
But this concerns you.

655
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,280
Plus,

656
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,400
Sun Tan has been very helpful

657
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
to us in Gannan.

658
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,440
I believe

659
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
if the roles were reversed,

660
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,320
he would have helped me.

661
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,680
Xing,

662
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,440
much obliged.

663
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,160
Since I've agreed to help you,

664
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,440
we'll need to plan this carefully.

665
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,480
Come with me.

666
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,440
Let's go.

667
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,640
My lord,

668
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,160
Sun Tan is truly very stubborn.

669
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,040
We have tried every

670
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
non-lethal method,

671
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,680
but he still wouldn't give in.

672
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,760
When did the men

673
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,960
at the Inspectorate

674
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
get this soft?

675
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,840
Whether he talks or not is not important.

676
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,080
As long as he's not in Gannan,

677
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,360
the Delinquents there

678
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,400
won't become a threat.

679
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,680
Anyone who tries to obstruct me

680
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,800
will not end up well.

681
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,920
Xiangren,

682
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,920
do you know if Lai Luozhi

683
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,480
has any

684
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
concrete evidence on Sun Tan?

685
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,200
Do you know

686
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,720
why are we called the Delinquents?

687
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,720
The wanderers from Jianghu appointed as

688
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,240
investigators or enforcers by the court

689
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,160
are called the Delinquents.

690
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,000
Quite so.

691
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,080
The Delinquents

692
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,560
are well-connected

693
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,960
and can obtain information more easily

694
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,600
than other departments in the court

695
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,840
because they only

696
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,920
recruit people

697
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,560
from all sorts of backgrounds

698
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,240
in the first place,

699
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,600
and named them so.

700
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,920
Many of them

701
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,920
were either notorious bandits

702
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,240
or skilled thieves like me

703
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,640
before joining,

704
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,000
and they usually

705
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
keep their connections

706
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,200
after they've joined.

707
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,480
Lai Luozhi can easily

708
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,080
fabricate some charges if he wants to.

709
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I'm worried that

710
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,880
Sun Tan's arrest

711
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,080
is not as simple

712
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,960
as it seems.

713
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,440
Lai Luozhi

714
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,800
has always been domineering,

715
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,840
but he has never dared to

716
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,000
mess with the Delinquents before.

717
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,200
The masked spectre case

718
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,480
has just been closed,

719
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
Gannan is still in disarray,

720
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,200
and he's already taken Sun Tan.

721
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,600
Is his real aim the Delinquents,

722
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
or Gannan?

723
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,520
Xing,

724
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
you just got back.

725
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,600
You probably don't know

726
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,280
what has happened

727
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,480
in Xiang'an.

728
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,760
Princess Ying's carriages

729
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,280
have been showing up much more

730
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,760
frequently at

731
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,560
Mingsheng Temple of Princess Runing.

732
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,720
Princess Runing and Princess Yong'an?

733
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,680
The current Emperor is still very young.

734
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,520
How much longer

735
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,160
can the Empress Dowager rule over Dacang?

736
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,760
Many now believe

737
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,200
that Princess Ying is more likely

738
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,000
to become Regent than Prince Xian.

739
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,040
So Princess Runing has decided

740
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,400
to help Princess Ying?

741
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,160
Princess Runing

742
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,960
is the highest-ranking princess

743
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,320
of the royal family.

744
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
If she were to decide,

745
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,360
it would surely

746
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,800
impact the court's dynamics.

747
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,760
Additionally,

748
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,920
the reconstruction of Ming Hall

749
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,280
was nearly completed,

750
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,800
then it suddenly slowed down,

751
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,040
almost as if it had

752
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,480
completely stopped.

753
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,040
This happened

754
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,000
shortly after

755
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,880
we got back from Gannan?

756
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,840
Moreover,

757
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,160
there are more

758
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,680
people from

759
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,440
Nanlang and Xichen in Xiang'an recently.

760
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,760
Seen alone,

761
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,880
these events might not mean much,

762
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,360
but if you connect them...

763
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,040
Could there

764
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,600
be some underlying scheme at play?

765
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,600
Xing,

766
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,960
I meant what I said.

767
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,920
There are many eyes

768
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,880
on you and your husband

769
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,280
in the court now.

770
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,800
You must be aware of that.

771
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,360
I won't blame you

772
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
if you don't help me with this.

773
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,920
Xiangren,

774
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,360
on the way back from Yingzhou,

775
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,960
we faced many assassination attempts.

776
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,120
It was the

777
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
delinquents that got us out of the harm's way.

778
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
Without this token,

779
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,640
I probably wouldn't be

780
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,720
standing here in front of you today.

781
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,000
Now that I'm back in Xiang'an,

782
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,240
I should return it to its rightful owner.

783
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,440
Xing,

784
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,600
I know it would be hard for Sun Tan

785
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,400
to get out of this unscathed.

786
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,160
But if he has been wronged,

787
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,000
or if he has anything to say,

788
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,920
I will definitely do my best

789
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,200
to help him for the brotherhood.

790
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,080
Can you find a way

791
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,520
for me to see Sun Tan?

792
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,680
I'll draft and submit the report and

793
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,920
apply to be the chief examiner now.

794
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,000
Even though

795
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,760
Sun Tan is being held at the Inspectorate,

796
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,400
as the Ministry of Justice is in charge.

797
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,320
I could go question him in prison.

798
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,840
Xing,

799
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,000
I will go with you.

800
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,360
He...

801
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,480
He has bled so much.

802
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,640
Will he die?

803
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,080
Once in the custody of the Inspectorate,

804
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,960
who really cares

805
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,120
about a prisoner's death?

806
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,360
If you're scared,

807
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,520
go back and wait for me there.

808
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:35,799
I, Yan Xing,

809
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,600
Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice,

810
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,240
the chief examiner of the Sun Tan case,

811
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,240
am here to take Sun Tan for interrogation.

812
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,440
He is a major criminal of the Inspectorate.

813
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,759
The Ministry of Justice can't take him.

814
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,600
Then I can still question him here,

815
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,520
can't I?

816
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,160
Only two people are allowed in.

817
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,080
Wait for me at the Ministry of Justice.

818
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,960
Then... Then I'll wait for you outside.

819
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,960
Mr. Sun.

820
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,520
Mr. Sun.

821
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,880
Mr. Sun.

822
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,080
It's me,

823
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,240
Yan Xing.

824
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,200
Have you allied with Lai Luozhi too?

825
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm the chief examiner

826
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
of this case.

827
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm here to seek justice for you.

828
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,160
The Inspectorate

829
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,280
is accusing you of embezzlement

830
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,320
and working with bandits.

831
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,720
If you have been wronged,

832
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,680
tell me.

833
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,760
I'll bring it up for you.

834
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,480
No use.

835
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
It's no use.

836
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,480
If you've been wronged,

837
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,240
Xiangren and the other Delinquents

838
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,000
will do anything to save you.

839
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,320
I will also do everything

840
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,480
to clear your name.

841
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,440
You will just get yourselves killed.

842
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,080
Get out of here.

843
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,840
Sun Tan,

844
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,880
I'm not dead yet.

845
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,520
Mr. Xu.

846
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,040
This token

847
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
is still waiting for you to take.

848
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,240
You must hold on for me.

849
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,720
Lady Yan,

850
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,760
I have something to say.

851
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,440
Okay.

852
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,800
Okay, I'll record it.

853
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,040
Most of the Delinquents

854
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
come from the Jianghu,

855
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,200
and were won over

856
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,080
by Mr. Xu's charisma,

857
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
joining the Delinquents out of loyalty.

858
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,600
At Gannan,

859
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,920
I naturally hoped to follow his example,

860
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,120
and have built many connections.

861
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,360
And they call it 'working with bandits'?

862
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,840
Then,

863
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,320
what about the embezzlement?

864
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,920
I can't deny this.

865
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,360
I did take the money.

866
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Many merchants pass through Gannan.

867
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,840
The Delinquents

868
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,600
would protect them from bandits,

869
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
and they would give us money as thanks.

870
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,000
I used the money

871
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
to build more connections.

872
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
You can bring it up and explain,

873
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,080
or find the merchants

874
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,360
to testify and get a reduced sentence.

875
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,920
Xing,

876
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,760
how can you still not understand?

877
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,800
What Lai Luozhi wants

878
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,080
is for the Delinquents at Gannan

879
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,320
to have no leader.

880
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,080
Mr. Sun,

881
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,920
then do you know why?

882
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,680
After Mo Qianzhi died,

883
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,840
most of the new officials of Yingzhou

884
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,520
are Lai Luozhi's men.

885
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Gannan is a crucial border fortress

886
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
that directly connects Xichen.

887
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,120
Even those from Nanlang in the far south

888
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,280
can use Gannan as a detour,

889
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,840
if the Delinquents can't defend it,

890
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,680
then the border fortress...

891
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,960
Recently, there have been

892
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,200
more people from Nanlang and Xichen

893
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,560
in Xiang'an.

894
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,920
It seems

895
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,840
that Lai Luozhi

896
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,880
wants to take complete control of Gannan.

897
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,360
But his ambitions

898
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,000
go far beyond Gannan.

899
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,040
He may be plotting to ally with

900
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,280
foreign forces and stage a rebellion.

901
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,720
Mr. Xu.

902
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,800
If you intend to frame me,

903
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,640
you should at least have some evidence.

904
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,720
Lady Yan,

905
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,080
you came to the Inspectorate as guests,

906
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,760
but made

907
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,320
accusations against me.

908
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,360
This really puts me in an awkward position.

909
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,760
I am the chief examiner for this case.

910
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,280
I'm here to question the main suspect,

911
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,080
Sun Tan, and to record his statements.

912
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,400
The Delinquent serves as the co-examiner.

913
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,960
We just go by books.

914
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Is that so?

915
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,600
Lady Yan, you are

916
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,160
becoming more and more sharp-tongued.

917
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,600
This is the preliminary questioning.

918
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,520
I'll review

919
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,160
and report the case files when I go back,

920
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,080
then I'll come here for a second time .

921
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,520
During this time,

922
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,480
you must ensure

923
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,840
the suspect's safety.

924
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,040
That is up to

925
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,680
his own fate.

926
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,440
The prison of the Inspectorate

927
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,480
is not known

928
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,120
for ensuring the inmates' safety.

929
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,440
How dare you!

930
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,600
Mr. Xu,

931
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,080
Lady Yan,

932
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,400
please go back.

933
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,840
I wasn't planning on keeping

934
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,440
you and Lady Yan here today.

935
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,480
Don't be nervous.

936
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,600
However,

937
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,840
I must advise you,

938
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,720
once the Inspectorate has arrested someone,

939
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,040
you don't just get to

940
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
reverse the case as you want.

941
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,040
You'd better think carefully

942
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,240
about what you listen to,

943
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,360
what to report,

944
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,160
and what

945
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,960
to keep to yourselves.
