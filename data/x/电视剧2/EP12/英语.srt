Melody of Golden Age EP12

3
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,080
Princess Ying has arrived!

4
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,920
Your Majesty.

5
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,120
Your Majesty.

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
I seek to bring charges against Lord Zhang

7
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,800
of using the exams to recruit

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,160
students from humble origins, and

9
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,440
plotting to kill them when they refused.

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,160
Today,

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
several of them have already gone missing.

12
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,080
Your Majesty!

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,280
I am being unjustly accused!

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,320
I merely sympathized with the hard journey

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,960
of the students from humble origins.

16
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,520
I was afraid they wouldn't be

17
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,160
well taken care of before the exam,

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,400
so I instructed the gentry to treat them.

19
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,160
How can such false accusations

20
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,480
be unleashed on me?

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,400
Then tell me,

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
what happened to those students

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,480
who left the banquet early?

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,040
Where are they now?

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,840
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
I believe that

27
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Lord Zhang is the head of the civil officials

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
and has always valued talent.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,080
To say he'd win over them is convincing,

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,480
but to say he would resort to violence

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,680
is probably

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,880
beyond one man's capability.

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,480
Lord Lai,

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,960
What do you mean by that?

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,560
Cease your nonsense!

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Yongan,

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
such a significant matter must not be

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,800
subjected to careless debate.

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,640
Do you have any evidence?

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
I...

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,520
I have it!

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
Last night, several students were attacked,

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,520
and were rescued by the Imperial Guard.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,880
These are the weapons we seized.

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,880
All of them are standard issue

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,640
from the Prince Xian's residence.

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Your Majesty!

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,320
I have nothing

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,400
to do with this!

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
I request a thorough investigation.

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,080
The assassins confessed before they died

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
that they were instructed by His Highness.

53
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,800
Lord Commander,

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,480
you...

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,640
End your baseless slander!

56
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,560
I

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
didn't know that

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,680
you pledged allegiance to the princess!

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
Lord Zhang, cease your cunning arguments!

60
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,200
There are both witnesses and evidence.

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,360
What right do you and Prince Xian have to

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,360
continue to oversee

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,480
the examinations?

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
Confess your crimes at once!

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,640
Violence-doers must face justice,

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
but they are not among them.

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,680
Lord Shen,

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,880
the people were saved by you,

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,920
and the evidence was brought by you,

70
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,240
why do you now claim

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,400
that the mastermind is someone else?

72
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,960
There were three groups of assailants.

73
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
The first was for abduction and intimidation.

74
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,560
It was for establishing authority

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,960
among the students from humble origins.

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
These individuals

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
were subordinates of Lord Zhang.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
I...

79
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,040
The second group was ruthless,

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,080
but they used weapons standard

81
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,720
to the Prince Xian's residence.

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,240
They frequently brought up

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,200
Prince Xian,

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,880
as if afraid others wouldn't know.

85
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,200
Who are you people?

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
His Highness is wise.

87
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
Threats and temptations won't work

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,280
on you stupid scholars.

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
It'd be better to eliminate all of you!

90
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
The third group

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,040
were hidden assailants

92
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,760
who used vicious methods just to silence them.

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,040
They used the standard

94
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,920
weapons of the Prince Xian's residence.

95
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
This doesn't make sense!

96
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,960
If His Highness is truly behind this,

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
how could it be so obvious?

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,720
Your Majesty,

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,640
this doesn't make sense at all!

100
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
It seems there are

101
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
a bunch of people out there

102
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,720
eager to convict me,

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,480
Your Majesty.

104
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
I implore Your Highness to see the truth.

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,560
Since the evidence is questionable,

106
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,840
then let the

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,000
Imperial Guard continue the investigation.

108
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
Thanks to Lord Shen,

110
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,040
the students

111
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,280
turned out to be safe.

112
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,000
From now on, we must ensure

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,560
that no further troubles arise.

114
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Prince Xian,

115
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
Lord Zhang,

116
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
the safety of these students

117
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,400
is in your hands.

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
If anything happens again,

119
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,880
you will be held accountable.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,240
Your Majesty, please rest easy.

122
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,480
Even at the cost of my own life,

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,440
I'll ensure the safety of the students.

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Commander!

125
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,680
Commander!

126
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,560
Thanks for your help earlier.

127
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,640
I was just conducting the investigation

128
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
without favoritism;

129
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,440
no need for gratitude, Lord Zhang.

130
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,120
Lord Zhang.

131
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
Gratitude for him is unnecessary.

132
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,760
He

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
was merely

134
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,160
showing off

135
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,480
in front of Her Royal Highness.

136
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,120
Apparently, Lord Lai

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,320
prefers to keep a low profile,

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,480
but remember, lurking in the shadows

139
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
can sometimes backfire.

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,720
- Cheers! - Cheers!

141
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,640
Xing girl, the lunch is on your for sure!

142
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,960
Let me tell you something.

143
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,400
You didn't witness the spectacle.

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,280
Today, when Lord Wu

145
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,400
heard that Xing was given the authority

146
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,680
to investigate the Chen Huo'e case,

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
his face was something else...

148
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,160
It turned purple, paling pig liver.

149
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
Lord Wu

150
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,640
even insisted that we sit

151
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,720
separately from her.

152
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
Sure, he is in charge at the ministry,

153
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,680
but can he really dictate

154
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,040
who I drink with?

155
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,080
Xing,

156
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,080
if this case requires

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
any assistance from the Delinquent,

158
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,520
don't hesitate to reach out to me.

159
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,400
Come on,

160
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
Let me raise a glass to you!

161
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,720
Me too.

162
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,840
Me too, me too!

163
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,920
Come on, cheers!

164
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,840
Alright.

165
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,480
By the way, Xing,

166
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,720
I'd like to ask you something.

167
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,320
Do you know of any

168
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,800
methods to remove birthmarks?

169
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Birthmarks?

170
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,360
How come I didn't know you have them?

171
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,680
I...

172
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,240
I have a friend.

173
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,280
He asked me about

174
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,720
how to remove birthmarks.

175
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,160
I've been exploring medical texts lately.

176
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
but I haven't found anything useful.

177
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,999
So I thought I'd come and ask you.

178
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,280
Birthmarks are something we're born with.

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,999
Birthmarks are not disease and

180
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,240
herbs alone can't remove them.

181
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,520
I've heard from some friends

182
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,400
about a method

183
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,600
for removing birthmarks.

184
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,960
What is it, Lord Xu?

185
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,920
This method sounds a bit unusual.

186
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,040
It involves using a ring made of pure gold

187
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,040
to continuously rub the birthmark.

188
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,680
That sounds pretty straightforward!

189
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,600
I have plenty of gold to spare.

190
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Thank you, Lord Xu.

191
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,480
Don't mention it.

192
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,360
Barman!

193
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
Barman!

194
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,960
There's no one around. I'll go get it.

195
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,680
Barman! More wine, please!

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,880
Chui...

197
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
Has she recently made any

198
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,120
friends with birthmarks?

199
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,160
Xing!

200
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,440
Xing!

201
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,760
You know,

202
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,120
there are a few drunks next door,

203
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,800
and one of them

204
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,960
is gorgeous.

205
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,280
He came to the office seeking you.

206
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,400
Looking for me?

207
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
That one, that one!

208
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,320
Here!

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,680
The one in the middle.

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,040
Pan?

211
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Pan.

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,800
Mr. Pan.

213
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,000
The examination is just around the corner.

214
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
Didn't you mention, you wanted to

215
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,760
bring honor to the humble families?

216
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,280
Why aren't you focusing on your studies?

217
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,920
Instead, you're here drinking?

218
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
Disregarding social status?

219
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,960
It's clear my effort can't overcome fate.

220
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,800
They are all from Prince Xian's residence.

221
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,080
He has dispatched three groups of people

222
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,360
to silence us, insignificant scholars

223
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,960
of humble origins.

224
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,280
This is just the beginning.

225
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
This examination

226
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,000
is not as straightforward as you think.

227
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
I advise you all not to naively

228
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,720
try to cling to a powerful figure.

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,120
Don't even think about wading into

230
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
the chaos of Xiang'an City.

231
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,680
The chaos of Xiang'an City

232
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,360
are but a reflection of the sullied hands

233
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,240
of those in power,

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
such as someone like you.

235
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,680
Is it wrong to seek power?

236
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
The issue isn't with power itself.

237
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,600
It's about how that power is wielded.

238
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,240
With power,

239
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
one can protect those they care about

240
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,800
and pursue what they believe is right.

241
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,960
Being self-righteous,

242
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,360
having nothing but a proud spirit,

243
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,760
what can you achieve with those

244
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
other than showing off your eloquence?

245
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
With this energy,

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,680
you'd be better off using it

247
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,200
in truly meaningful ways.

248
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,320
I might as well drink.

249
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
Drinking is more meaningful.

250
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,520
Please send them back to the Guishi

251
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,280
Thanks.

252
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,520
Clerk Yan.

253
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,120
Live life to the fullest.

254
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,120
Don't let the drinks stop flowing.

255
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,640
Keep the drinks coming!

256
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Easy, easy.

257
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,160
The examination is just around the corner.

258
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,840
How come he acts like

259
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,400
he is drowning his sorrows in alcohol?

260
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,600
Xing, haven't you heard?

261
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,280
Last night, three groups of thugs tried to

262
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,800
kill the students of humble origins.

263
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,280
Is that true?

264
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,040
Yes, it is.

265
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,760
What happened to the students?

266
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,480
Didn't the Commander tell you?

267
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,040
He single-handedly turned the tide

268
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,920
and saved them all.

269
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,840
Otherwise, it would have been a disaster.

270
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,080
Shen Du saved them?

271
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,000
Deliver this to the Ministry of Justice.

272
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,800
Gratitude.

273
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,000
Excuse me, my lady,

274
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm looking for

275
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,800
a female official, Clerk Yan.

276
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,080
She's not here.

277
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,280
She's out investigating with White Death.

278
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,200
White Death?

279
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,840
The commander of Imperial Guard, Shen Du.

280
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,360
He is Xing's husband.

281
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,000
Husband?

282
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
I heard the wife of IG Commander

283
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,880
got beat up again today.

284
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,560
She left with a limp.

285
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,800
Yeah,

286
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,840
her forehead is

287
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,080
swollen quite a bit.

288
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,200
Can she truly find happiness

289
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
by marrying White Death?

290
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,080
Xing,

291
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
we have shared much,

292
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,640
and your wedding

293
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,080
should bring me joy.

294
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,080
But the thought of you marrying

295
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,880
the notorious White Death

296
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,440
troubles me deeply.

297
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,280
My lady.

298
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,160
Zhong.

299
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,280
Greetings.

300
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
What's the matter?

301
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,000
Since my lord returned, he's been

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,760
in the training of martial arts,

303
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
and hasn't had dinner yet.

304
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
My lady, you're finally back.

305
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
You should head to the backyard.

306
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,920
For the past few days,

307
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,040
the Commander has been at home,

308
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,280
preparing tea and snacks for you.

309
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,920
But you've either been out on cases

310
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,760
or drinking with

311
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
a bunch of strangers.

312
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,480
Now that the Commander

313
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,520
has been waiting for you all night.

314
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,360
So...

315
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,640
He's been waiting for me?

316
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,480
I thought

317
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
you were busy with investigations.

318
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,560
Now start serving the dishes.

319
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,240
Nice punches!

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,440
So you do realize you have a home.

321
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,640
Me?

322
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,840
I reported for duty to the Imperial Guard.

323
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,640
I also investigated

324
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,720
Chen Shoujie's residence

325
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,880
and went out for drinks

326
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
with Chui and Chief Xu.

327
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,320
I even ran into the merchant, Pan.

328
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,760
So I came back a bit late.

329
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,560
Did you need something from me?

330
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,520
I'm hungry.

331
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,320
If you're hungry, you should eat!

332
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,560
By the way,

333
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,280
I came back to let you know.

334
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,240
I promised my mother that

335
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
I'd return to the Yan residence tonight.

336
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,760
You go ahead and eat.

337
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm leaving now.

338
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,040
You little...

339
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,560
I've already prepared dinner for you.

340
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
Forget dinner.

341
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
This family will fall apart without me!

342
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
Zhong, you go ahead.

343
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,200
We will join you shortly.

344
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,640
My lord,

345
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,600
my lady is not just some

346
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
illiterate village girl.

347
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,720
She is a respected female official

348
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
in the Ministry of Justice.

349
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,960
She holds a public position.

350
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,640
During the day, she handles serious matters,

351
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,280
and at night, it's normal that

352
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,360
she shares a drink with her colleagues.

353
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,840
On the other hand,

354
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,120
you might be overreacting a bit.

355
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,200
So what I mean is,

356
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,760
you might as well take this opportunity...

357
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,000
Mother!

358
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,720
I really can't take anymore.

359
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,439
This is the finest tonic

360
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,640
that I chose for you.

361
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,840
I made it just for you.

362
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,960
It's a shame your husband isn't with you,

363
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,199
or you two could have enjoyed it together.

364
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,000
I promise you'd have two kids in three years!

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,360
Mother.

366
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,159
Stop your wild imagination, please.

367
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,919
Did you put anything

368
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:51,760
weird in it?

369
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,600
No, not at all.

370
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
I wish there was something special.

371
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,760
I wish I had the power

372
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,040
that Chen Huo'e possesses.

373
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,440
Otherwise, I'd get you some

374
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,320
elixir for immortality

375
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,600
and resurrection.

376
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,520
Come again, mother?

377
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,480
How do you know about Chen Huo'e?

378
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,400
Are you kidding?

379
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,120
Is there anyone in all of Xiang'an

380
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,040
who doesn't know about her?

381
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,960
Five years ago,

382
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,360
Chen Huo'e committed suicide in public.

383
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,960
She died and came back to life,

384
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
reborn from the ashes.

385
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,160
She fought her way back

386
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,200
from the underworld,

387
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,600
overcoming countless obstacles.

388
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,880
Her power is

389
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,680
incredible!

390
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,960
Mother, where did you hear

391
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
about all these nonsense?

392
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,880
I heard it from the

393
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,920
primary wife.

394
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,200
You don't believe me, fine,

395
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,800
but you can't doubt her words.

396
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,760
Everyone in Xiang'an's noble circles

397
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,360
is talking about this Chen Huo'e.

398
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,000
She has the power to cross the gates of hell.

399
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,280
Even Death himself

400
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,080
can't do anything to her.

401
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,240
Mother, you smell amazing!

402
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,800
What perfume are you wearing today?

403
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Curious to know?

404
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,640
Want some?

405
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,480
Then you should eat a bit more.

406
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,920
Xing,

407
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,880
I heard that thanks to you, Caiwei

408
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
and Mr. Han were able to return safely.

409
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,240
You rarely come back,

410
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,720
so my lord instructed the kitchen

411
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,920
to prepare some late-night snacks.

412
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,400
Help yourself.

413
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,680
Dig in.

414
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,760
Xing,

415
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,880
there're rumors circling about

416
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
you and the Commander.

417
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,240
If you ever feel mistreated,

418
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,320
you need to let us know.

419
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,760
Right.

420
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,080
Commander Shen has arrived.

421
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,760
Who is he going to catch this time?

422
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,720
Commander, this way please.

423
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,320
Come on,

424
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,800
go hide in the back room!

425
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,840
Hurry!

426
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,960
Don't act like you're seeing the King of Hell.

427
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,360
He won't eat you.

428
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,640
Mojie.

429
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,640
Ever since the last time

430
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
you were taken by White Death,

431
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,040
you seem like a completely different man.

432
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,560
Why are you speaking highly of him?

433
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Of course!

434
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm now...

435
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,920
now...

436
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,440
I can't reveal that.

437
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,920
Greetings, Lord Commander.

438
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
Looks like I arrived just in time.

439
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,160
I could join my lady

440
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,320
and all of you

441
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,920
for a late-night snack.

442
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,640
Yes, indeed.

443
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,080
What brings you here?

444
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,680
Lord Commander, please take a seat.

445
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,960
In the absence of my beloved,

446
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
even the finest cuisine loses its savor.

447
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,440
Lord Yan, please.

448
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,160
Gratitude, Lord Commander.

449
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,320
Gratitude.

450
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,240
My lady.

451
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,680
Here.

452
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
Thanks.

453
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
That's enough, enough!

454
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,560
There you go!

455
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,760
Please, savor this dish slowly, my lady.

456
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,360
Though it may not match the fine taste

457
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,720
of your own cooking,

458
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,360
it offers the solace of a familiar taste.

459
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,640
Don't just stand there.

460
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,000
Everyone, dig in.

461
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,880
Alright, alright.

462
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,840
I still want to

463
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,320
chat with my sister a bit more.

464
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,560
Why don't you head back first,

465
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,040
darling?

466
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,880
Alright.

467
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,920
Take your time.

468
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,480
I'll wait for you.

469
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,360
No need to rush.

470
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,080
Shen Du, what exactly are you planning?

471
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,120
Lord Commander,

472
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,600
the information I provided recently

473
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,800
was quite timely, right?

474
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,240
As soon as I saw those students of

475
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
humble origins, not knowing their place,

476
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,200
I figured that Lord Zhang would

477
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
definitely take action against them.

478
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,800
As expected of Xing's brother,

479
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,000
your intelligence is remarkable.

480
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
Gratitude, my lord.

481
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,520
Once I pass this examination,

482
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,360
my lord, please promote...

483
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,240
Lord Commander,

484
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,040
apologies for my son's nonsense.

485
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
Please don't take offense.

486
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,440
Please don't take offense.

487
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
It was indeed him who saved the students.

488
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,520
Please come in, Lord Commander.

489
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,000
With nothing else to attend to,

490
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,880
I am eager for you to take a look at the

491
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,920
calligraphy I have spent years perfecting.

492
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,080
I have long heard that Lord Yan

493
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,640
is a master of calligraphy in the empire.

494
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,520
Today, to be able to see your works,

495
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,960
is truly a stroke of luck.

496
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,400
I didn't expect that the Yan residence

497
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,400
would actually collect

498
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,760
so many calligraphy works.

499
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,640
About this piece of calligraphy...

500
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
Isn't the original in the palace?

501
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,120
I didn't expect

502
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,080
that I couldn't hide it

503
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,800
from Lord Commander's discerning eye.

504
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,840
The original of this calligraphy

505
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,320
is indeed in the palace.

506
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,040
This piece of calligraphy

507
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,000
is but an imitation

508
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,640
by me.

509
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,880
To be honest,

510
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,680
Lord Commander,

511
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,080
all the famous works in this room

512
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,760
are merely imitations of mine.

513
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,920
They look very authentic.

514
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,360
I didn't expect that Lord Yan

515
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,520
would be so adept at imitating

516
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,440
the calligraphy of various masters.

517
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
You flattered me.

518
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
I have no other talents,

519
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,920
only this skill in copying.

520
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,760
I can barely manage to stand out.

521
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,000
I heard that my lord and son...

522
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,360
Lord Commander

523
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,760
are enjoying calligraphy,

524
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,280
which reminded me that my lord once copied

525
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,680
Lord Shen's calligraphy.

526
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,240
I dug it out.

527
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,800
My father's?

528
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,920
Apologies, Lord Commander.

529
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,120
I...

530
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,360
I wasn't planning anything harmful.

531
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
It's just that...

532
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,640
It's fine.

533
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,320
My father being a condemned official,

534
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,120
people shied away from associating with him.

535
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,840
Actually,

536
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,640
I did put in some effort

537
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,960
to study Lord Shen's brushwork

538
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,600
back then.

539
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,840
When Lord Shen was young,

540
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,280
his brush strokes were like swords,

541
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,040
powerful and grand.

542
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,560
But later on,

543
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,120
his strokes became more subtle,

544
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,600
ancient and smooth.

545
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,520
I also practiced for a long time

546
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
to achieve

547
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,800
this level of similarity.

548
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,640
Could it be...

549
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,120
I haven't seen

550
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,880
such a striking resemblance

551
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,440
to my father's handwriting in a long time.

552
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,520
I was momentarily lost in thought

553
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,400
and lost my manners.

554
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,640
Not at all.

555
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,800
I have business back in the IG.

556
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,560
I must take my leave.

557
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,040
Alright, alright.

558
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,560
Lord Commander, you're a busy man.

559
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,480
No need to walk me out.

560
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,840
Take care, Lord Commander.

561
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
Sigh...

562
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,320
Lord Zhang has mentioned that

563
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,160
Shen Du confessed on his father's behalf

564
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,280
so he could get out of jail.

565
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,400
Why did you bring up

566
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
this topic again?

567
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,080
How...

568
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,720
How would I know?

569
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
Father, your handwriting is excellent.

570
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
Please give me a piece.

571
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,760
Since my arm

572
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
was injured a few years ago,

573
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,440
my brushwork is not as strong as before.

574
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
I will give you a

575
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,120
fan I wrote on before.

576
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,920
The strokes are smooth, and

577
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,520
the brush strokes were like swords.

578
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,680
Indeed, they are the same style.

579
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,080
The forger of the letters

580
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,560
incriminating my father for treason...

581
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,960
Could it be

582
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,240
Xing's father?

583
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
Why isn't he here yet?

584
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,520
Maskman!

585
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,560
Maskman,

586
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,960
You're finally here.

587
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
Are you here to see your mother?

588
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,760
I'm here for you.

589
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,040
For me?

590
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,040
This is for you.

591
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,800
What is this?

592
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
I found out about a folk remedy

593
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,120
that can remove birthmarks.

594
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,360
It's said that by using this

595
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,120
to rub on the birthmark back and forth,

596
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,800
it can lighten and eliminate it.

597
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,680
You should give it a try.

598
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,360
You specifically came to give me this?

599
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,760
Then if I don't show up today...

600
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,400
I'll just come tomorrow.

601
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,960
Anyway, I'll come to keep my mother company.

602
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,160
She'll be happy to see me.

603
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
Let me teach you.

604
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,680
Stretch out your hand.

605
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,400
Just like this.

606
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,800
Rub back and forth on the birthmark.

607
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,480
It shouldn't be too gentle,

608
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,680
or overly firm.

609
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,720
Got it?

610
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,600
Here you go.

611
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,920
Keep it.

612
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,600
Anyway,

613
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,280
you must persist

614
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,320
for it to be effective.

615
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,440
We are not related by blood,

616
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
so why would you

617
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
give me such a valuable thing?

618
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,280
It's alright.

619
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,440
I, Lu Chuichui,

620
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,120
have plenty of gold.

621
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,040
As long as your birthmark can be removed,

622
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,000
in the future,

623
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,840
you will be able to take off the mask

624
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,120
and face the

625
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,800
world with honesty.

626
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,200
That is worth more than

627
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,320
any amount of gold.

628
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,120
Thank you.

629
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,480
I seek justice, my lord.

630
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,000
I come to plead my case.

631
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
I implore my lord to intervene.

632
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,440
To have someone appeal to me for justice,

633
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,480
this is truly unprecedented.

634
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,880
What injustice are you seeking to rectify?

635
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,760
In the case of Jinxiu Workshop years ago,

636
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,440
many died by injustice.

637
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,680
My lord, please investigate thoroughly.

638
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,720
Boring.

639
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Be gone.

640
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,080
Lord Commander.

641
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,920
I heard that you are known as White Death,

642
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,560
an honorable man who catches evil doers,

643
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
and you won't ignore the injustice.

644
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,480
If Lord Commander

645
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,160
won't right the Jinxiu Workshop wrongs,

646
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,640
I am willing to die to prove my point.

647
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,800
Madwoman.

648
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,360
She's probably an assassin.

649
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,360
My lord,

650
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,120
please right the Jinxiu Workshop wrongs.

651
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,800
Stop it.

652
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,040
Lord Lai.

653
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,960
What crime has this woman committed?

654
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,080
Burning someone on the street?

655
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,840
This is the Zhuque Street of Xiang'an,

656
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
right under the emperor's gaze.

657
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,560
People are all watching.

658
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,440
You wouldn't take a life recklessly, right?

659
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,960
I'm just dealing with an assassin.

660
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,680
Do you want to intervene, Commander Shen?

661
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,240
Commander Shen?

662
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,560
So you are

663
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,000
the White Death, Commander Shen.

664
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,960
I am not an assassin.

665
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,920
I am seeking justice.

666
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,520
I implore my lord to act.

667
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,080
Reopen the case; it was wrongfully decided.

668
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,760
Lord Lai,

669
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,200
Since this girl

670
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,680
has been looking for me.

671
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,200
I will take her with me.

672
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,560
Since Lord Commander has requested,

673
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,840
this girl will be handed over to you.

674
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,760
Lord Commander,

675
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,880
Yunque has long known of your

676
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,040
strict and impartial nature,

677
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,080
the very image of integrity.

678
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,520
My family in Jiangnan

679
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
supplies silks for the Jinxiu Workshop.

680
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,560
This is the record of the orders

681
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,040
that Jinxiu Workshop placed.

682
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,360
This was the order placed

683
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,000
by the princess's husband back then.

684
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,320
The one that exceeded regulations.

685
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,840
However, this order paper

686
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,120
is thinner than usual.

687
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,360
If it can be proven that this order

688
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,440
has been tampered with,

689
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
it could clear the name for us,

690
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,400
Is that right?

691
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm taking the evidence.

692
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,640
You should go home now.

693
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,880
If necessary, the Imperial Guard

694
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,640
will reach out to your parents.

695
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,880
The owners of the workshop

696
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,560
are truly good people.

697
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,800
They must have been wronged.

698
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,520
Jinglin.

699
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,760
Escort her out of the city.

700
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,240
Help!

701
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,760
Sir,

702
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,400
please go after him.

703
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,480
Don't let him escape!

704
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,200
He's far gone.

705
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,840
Miss, are you alright?

706
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,120
You don't need to worry about me.

707
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,680
You should go after him!

708
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,400
He must be connected to

709
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,480
the case of the Jinxiu Workshop.

710
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,160
Otherwise, he wouldn't want to silence me.

711
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,800
Mr. Xu.

712
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,640
Xing.

713
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,360
Lord Commander.

714
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,120
Miss Yunque,

715
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,400
was attacked at the inn last night.

716
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,240
If I hadn't happened to patrol by,

717
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,520
she would have been harmed.

718
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,280
Is this how your Imperial Guard

719
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,840
protects witnesses?

720
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,080
I sent her out of the city yesterday.

721
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,080
How did she sneak back in?

722
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,400
Lord Commander,

723
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,600
Yunque almost

724
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
couldn't see you again.

725
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
That man in black

726
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,240
definitely wanted to silence me.

727
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,080
Lord Commander,

728
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,360
you've taken my evidence,

729
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,720
which means you need to keep me safe.

730
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,480
That order from the Jinxiu Workshop

731
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,640
is crucial evidence

732
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,720
for their case.

733
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,080
I am a key witness.

734
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,480
You can't leave me unprotected.

735
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,440
I mentioned it to you yesterday.

736
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
That case

737
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,880
cannot be overturned

738
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,640
based solely on this

739
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,760
order from six years ago.

740
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,880
You made a scene in Xiang'an City,

741
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,480
and it almost made the whole world

742
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,000
to know you are involved in this case.

743
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,280
Do you find it

744
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,840
exciting and fun?

745
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Do you know that

746
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,040
this case is complex and far-reaching?

747
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,880
Last night, you attracted assassins,

748
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,400
and tomorrow you could bring

749
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,120
disaster to your family.

750
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,520
You are so

751
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,320
passionate about solving the case,

752
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,120
but what about your family?

753
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,600
I didn't think that far.

754
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,120
I was wrong.

755
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,120
Now that it has come to this,

756
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,080
the Imperial Guard will enhance

757
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,840
protection for your safety.

758
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,360
As for your parents,

759
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll deploy guardsmen to watch over them.

760
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,360
The case will be investigated by us.

761
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,440
Until the truth is revealed,

762
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,160
you'd better stay put.

763
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
Thanks, Lord Commander, I knew you

764
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,280
wouldn't leave me to fend for myself.

765
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,640
You have the order

766
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,880
from six years ago.

767
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,920
So what's your connection

768
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,960
to them?

769
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,680
So that everything I just said

770
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,840
was pointless, huh?

771
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,160
I'm just curious, you know.

772
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,680
Who are you, anyway?

773
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,440
That evidence was given to Lord Commander,

774
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,600
so why should I share it with you?

775
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,640
Show respect to my lord's wife!

776
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,680
Lord Commander,

777
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,440
you...

778
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,760
You're married?

779
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,720
Isn't it said that

780
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,200
all the women

781
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,240
who tried to marry him

782
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,640
would meet with misfortune?

783
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,040
How could this be?

784
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,400
Yunque always believed

785
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,200
that somehow,

786
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,160
he was waiting for me to marry him.

787
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,240
So all these years,

788
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,640
I've been diligently learning

789
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,440
how to manage household affairs,

790
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,280
how to be a good primary wife,

791
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,680
how to cook, keep accounts, and make beds.

792
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,440
Even in my dreams,

793
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,040
I've been thinking about marrying him.

794
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,280
You, you must be out of your mind!

795
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,760
My lady,

796
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,200
this has nothing to do with us!

797
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,840
It's...

798
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,800
It's this woman.

799
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,520
She cried out for justice on the street.

800
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,200
That's why my lord

801
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,080
brought her back.

802
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,920
What's there to misunderstand?

803
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
There are at least thousands of women

804
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,320
in Xiang'an

805
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,360
who admire Lord Commander.

806
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,560
That's quite normal.

807
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,400
Besides,

808
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,600
we are fa...

809
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,440
If you happen to find your ideal partner,

810
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,600
that's a good thing.

811
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,520
It seems you've made your decision.

812
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,720
So what are you

813
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,600
planning to do next?

814
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,520
At Chen Shoujie's residence,

815
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,160
I've only found

816
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,760
a piece of fabric from the workshop.

817
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,800
I still need to confirm

818
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,640
which year's pattern it was.

819
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,960
Changing the subject.

820
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,800
Very well.
