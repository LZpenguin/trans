English subtitles are available

00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:45,680
Melody of Golden Age EP35

3
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,240
Chui,

4
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,640
here, take a look.

5
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
This is exquisite silk

6
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,400
brought in from Jiangnan.

7
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,880
See the patterns and the texture.

8
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,960
I'll have the embroiderer make you

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,440
a wedding dress. What do you think?

10
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,680
Chui,

11
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,080
look,

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll wear this outfit on that day.

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,360
Isn't this fitting?

14
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,640
Are you insane?

15
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
I absolutely refuse to marry you!

16
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,440
You will marry me for sure.

17
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,720
One day,

18
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
you will come to accept it.

19
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,280
Look,

20
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,720
these two outfits

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,000
look so perfect together.

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,640
Let go of me!

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
You jerk, let go of me!

24
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,520
Before you come to like me

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,920
as much as you like Jiang Langxing

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
and are willing to marry me,

27
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,640
you are not going anywhere.

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
I will never have feelings for you!

29
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
Is that so?

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,200
What,

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,640
are you still waiting

32
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,880
for someone to rescue you?

33
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,920
That won't happen.

34
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,080
Neither Jiang Langxing nor Yan Xing

35
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,360
will come to your rescue.

36
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
I am warning you,

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
don't you lay a finger on them!

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,880
I won't harm them,

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,880
unless they bring it upon themselves!

40
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Chui...

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
Chui,

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,960
in this world,

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,440
everyone only looks out for themselves.

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
No one can be trusted.

45
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,840
You only have me to depend upon.

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,080
Only me...

47
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
What?

48
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,640
You're not going to punch me this time?

49
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,400
Chui,

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,360
I genuinely have feelings for you.

51
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,320
From now on,

52
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,400
I won't push you anymore.

53
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,120
I will patiently wait

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,280
until the day

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,440
you truly fall in love with me.

56
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,040
Madame Jin.

57
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,440
Excuse me.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Coming through.

59
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,760
-Yan Xing! -Slow down.

60
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,520
Xing!

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,960
Mother!

62
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
Mother!

63
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,240
You've been released?

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
Your father has a conscience.

65
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
He wrote a petition,

66
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
stating that I'm no longer a Jin,

67
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,920
and I'm already part of the Yan Family.

68
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,920
It was Lord Zhang; he sent someone to

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,000
convey the message, telling me to do so.

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
Lord Shen arranged

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
for guardsmen to escort me

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,360
while I retrieve your mother.

73
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,200
My lady,

74
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,760
my lord has entered the palace.

75
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,400
Mother,

76
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
you have suffered!

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm fine.

78
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,000
it's just that your uncle...

79
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,240
He is...

80
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,760
Her Majesty' wisdom is unparalleled!

81
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,880
"Melancholy and Mirth" was composed by me,

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,280
and it has nothing to do with Prince Xian.

83
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,560
It has even less to do with my family!

84
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,800
His Highness and I share a deep bond,

85
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,560
appreciating each other's music.

86
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
This is all

87
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,320
a conspiracy orchestrated by Lai Luozhi!

88
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,760
Her Majesty is astute

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
and will vindicate Prince Xian.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Jin Zang!

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
-Mother! -Jin Zang!

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
-Mother! -Jin Zang!

93
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
Your death is imminent; stop the nonsense!

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,960
Someone!

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
Burn him in jar!

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
Lai Luozhi! You've crossed

97
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,960
the line to carry out a public punishment!

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Chancellor Lai, there's

99
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,240
something I'd like to let you know.

100
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
This secret

101
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
is something I can only share with you!

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,960
Step back, step back!

103
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,840
You, a mere musician with no strength to

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,720
harm a fly.

105
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm eager to find out

106
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
what your

107
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,520
dying words are.

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,200
It is because of you

109
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,520
that my family and I

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,720
have faced this calamity!

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
-Uncle! -Zang!

112
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,440
-Uncle! -Zang!

113
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,160
No one moves!

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,640
-Zang! -Step back!

115
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,360
Uncle!

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
His chest...

117
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Fire moth...

118
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,760
Xing,

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
ensure this blood letter

120
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,240
reaches Her Royal Highness,

121
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,680
and take good care of yourself

122
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,240
and your mother.

123
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Zang!

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Uncle!

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,720
Zang!

126
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Zang!

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,040
No!

128
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
Uncle!

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Jin!

130
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,640
Lai Luozhi,

131
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
are you trying to openly snatch

132
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
the testimony for Her Royal Highness

133
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,880
in broad daylight?

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,600
Step back!

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,720
What?

136
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,720
Jin Zang is dead?

137
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,040
I...

138
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
When did I ever

139
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,440
order his death?

140
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
Mr. Jin, unable to bear the humiliation,

141
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
cried out for Prince Xian's injustice

142
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,760
during the public shaming,

143
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,720
claiming it was all

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,200
a conspiracy orchestrated by Chancellor Lai.

145
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
He then took his own life in public.

146
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
This is the blood letter

147
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
written by Mr. Jin before his death,

148
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,520
for Your Royal Highness' review.

149
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Your Royal... Your Royal Highness!

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,640
When did I...

151
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
When did I ever demand

152
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
the destruction of the Jin Family?

153
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Your Royal Highness, Jin Zang has

154
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
stirred the hearts of the people,

155
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
spreading deceitful words.

156
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,160
Before his death, he even tried to frame me.

157
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
I've been unjustly accused, Your Majesty!

158
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
Chancellor Lai has blown this out of proportion,

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800
turning a simple feast

160
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,120
into a bloodbath.

161
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,120
Now, with Mr. Jin dying tragically in public,

162
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,560
the court is rife with rumors.

163
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,240
The Imperial Inspectorate should

164
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,160
withdraw from this case immediately.

165
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,320
I implore Your Royal Highness

166
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
to place the Jins

167
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,880
under the custody of the Imperial Guard.

168
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,800
Your Royal Highness,

169
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,560
don't.

170
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,640
Enough!

171
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,360
Even now, you wish to compete for power?

172
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,000
You really don't make it easy for me.

173
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,520
Lord Shen, since you're

174
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,720
not afraid of getting your hands dirty

175
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,920
and insist on intervening,

176
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,800
then you should take over

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
the case of the Jin Family.

178
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,360
Gratitude, Your Royal Highness.

179
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,400
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

180
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,040
You are indeed a clever one.

181
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,320
But aren't you afraid

182
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,640
that without my summons,

183
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,680
I might punish you for entering

184
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,360
the palace at such a late hour?

185
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,960
If Your Majesty wishes to punish me,

186
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,400
I can only accept my fate with gratitude.

187
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you know?

188
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,440
Until midnight,

189
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,280
I have been reviewing

190
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,280
the musical scores left by Jin Zang,

191
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,120
only to realize

192
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,640
that he has been by my side for so long.

193
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,720
My beloved Huan isn't

194
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,040
showing any leniency towards me.

195
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,920
How can this game allow for leniency?

196
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,080
Even if you lose,

197
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
I won't punish you.

198
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
If losing brings no punishment,

199
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
then what about winning?

200
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,720
Is there a reward?

201
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
What reward do you desire?

202
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,600
If Xu wins this round,

203
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,840
my beloved, could you

204
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,840
grant me the position of crown princess?

205
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,560
Aye,

206
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,280
it's a deal.

207
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,240
A wise man sees potential before it blooms.

208
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,400
Your Double Flying Swallow move,

209
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,520
may seem simple,

210
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,200
but it has endless follow-ups.

211
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,360
In this round,

212
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,800
I have actually lost.

213
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,280
My beloved, please keep your promise.

214
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,720
Aye,

215
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I grant you that.

216
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,520
From the moment I entered the palace,

217
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,400
every time I performed a dance,

218
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,480
to every significant occasion in my life,

219
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,400
and every sleepless night,

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,440
his zither

221
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,320
has always been there.

222
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,600
This score remains unfinished,

223
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,320
he intended to perform it at the

224
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,920
grand ceremony after the Ming hall

225
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,880
is completed.

226
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,320
He was never one to speak much,

227
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,880
never...

228
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,880
And his silence was so profound

229
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,120
that I often forgot

230
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,720
there was such a person.

231
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,280
It felt as if

232
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,360
only a zither

233
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,920
was placed behind the curtain.

234
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
Whenever I felt on edge,

235
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,239
this zither

236
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
would automatically play

237
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,439
soothing melodies.

238
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
But now,

239
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
this one will never play again.

240
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,480
I am the one to blame.

241
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,000
But Prince Xian

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,080
is my only son.

243
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,120
You know,

244
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,800
when I was little,

245
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,320
an oracle warned that

246
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,600
my power and influence would be too great,

247
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,640
capable of harming those around me.

248
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,120
He also predicted

249
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,040
that I would ultimately end up alone.

250
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,800
At that time, I was furious

251
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,240
and even had someone

252
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,640
beat that oracle up.

253
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
But now, reflecting on it,

254
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,440
he was indeed correct.

255
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,880
No one can walk with me

256
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,480
until the end without being unharmed.

257
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,800
Lord Shen,

258
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,120
I understand you have

259
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,760
also been searching for an answer.

260
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,840
Once this whole thing

261
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,640
is fully resolved,

262
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,880
I will provide you with an answer.

263
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Why are you still awake?

264
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,960
I was thinking about my uncle.

265
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,880
I know you were very close to your uncle,

266
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
so it's natural to feel sorrow.

267
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,800
Tomorrow, I'll take you back to the Yans

268
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,120
to spend some quality time with Madam Jin.

269
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Death cannot be reversed,

270
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,560
and sorrow serves no purpose.

271
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,200
I was reflecting

272
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,040
on what my uncle said

273
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
before he passed,

274
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,200
"his chest"

275
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
"fire moth"

276
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,560
Could it be that Mr. Jin

277
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,760
knew something about the Fire Moth Sect?

278
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,800
My uncle was as weak as a newborn,

279
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,600
and he clearly knew it was impossible

280
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,920
to harm Lai Luozhi.

281
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,840
Yet, in his dying breath,

282
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,520
he found the resolve to surge forward

283
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,800
and tear at his collar.

284
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,920
What was it for?

285
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,760
Was it merely to humiliate him?

286
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,560
Has Chui returned?

287
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,120
Have you found Chui?

288
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Where could she be...

289
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,360
If something happens to her,

290
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,080
how will I face

291
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,160
her mother in the afterlife?

292
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,320
Ease your mind,

293
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,200
I'll go look for her again

294
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
and I will definitely bring her back!

295
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,800
Alright.

296
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,840
You are indeed bold.

297
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,160
A mere lowly delinquent like you

298
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,280
dares to intrude into my residence?

299
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,840
Where's Lu Chuichui?

300
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,200
Do you even realize what you're saying?

301
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Jiang Langxing, a mere delinquent,

302
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,640
sneaking into my residence at night,

303
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
Words beyond propriety, faults irredeemable.

304
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,200
Detain him in the Imperial Inspectorate.

305
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,480
There will never be another Sun Tan

306
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,080
among our ranks.

307
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,280
Your skills are lacking;

308
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,600
be gone at once.

309
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Chief Xu, you harmed my subordinate

310
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,760
without discerning the facts;

311
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,200
I deserve an explanation, don't I?

312
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,360
Lai Luozhi,

313
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,960
You know precisely

314
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,200
what you did.

315
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
Who will suffer the consequences

316
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,920
if the things escalate

317
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,160
is still uncertain.

318
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,240
And let's not forget, within the palace,

319
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,000
I can retrieve anything as simple as

320
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
plucking fruit from a tree.

321
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
If you're hiding something inappropriate,

322
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,440
I assure you,

323
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,040
I have the means to retrieve it.

324
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,760
Chui!

325
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,960
Chui?

326
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,800
Chui?

327
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,000
Chui?

328
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,120
Chui!

329
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,800
She's just an ordinary girl,

330
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,040
yet you seem to care so much.

331
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,280
What do you know!

332
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,320
In this world,

333
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
I am utterly alone, and she's

334
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,280
the only one who truly understands me

335
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,000
and cares for me sincerely.

336
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,120
We share the same blood!

337
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,800
I am your sister!

338
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,400
I will show no mercy to

339
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,040
anyone who thwarts my plans.

340
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,400
I will eliminate

341
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,200
every

342
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,840
last one of them.

343
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,200
Eradicate them all!

344
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,040
I've been contemplating

345
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
how I could make you

346
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,400
vanish forever

347
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,800
from this world,

348
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,720
without him ever realizing it's me.

349
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,080
But unfortunately,

350
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,000
when it comes to poison and murder,

351
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,080
he is far more adept than I am.

352
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,200
However, I've come to understand

353
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,800
that instead of letting you die,

354
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,000
it's better to ensure he can never

355
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,240
have you!

356
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,440
Mr. Xu?

357
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Chui!

358
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,320
Chui, Chui!

359
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,680
How are you?

360
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,680
Let me see,

361
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,640
are you hurt?

362
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,720
Chui!

363
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,960
Chui!

364
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,280
It's me!

365
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,520
Dummy,

366
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,840
what took you so long?

367
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,520
You're such a big fool!

368
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,960
I rushed to the Lai residence to save you,

369
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,560
but I ran into Chief who came to my aid,

370
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,160
and only then did I realize

371
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,520
he had already rescued you.

372
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,920
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

373
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,840
I thought

374
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,920
I would never see you again.

375
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,960
It's my fault for failing to protect you.

376
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,080
I promise

377
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,360
you will never face harm again

378
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,640
from now on.

379
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,320
Chui!

380
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,160
Sorry!

381
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,880
Sorry!

382
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,360
I'm truly sorry!

383
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,800
What?

384
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,040
You were taken by Lai Luozhi?

385
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,680
When did this happen?

386
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,040
How come I had no idea at all?

387
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,160
He didn't hurt you, did he?

388
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
I'm fine.

389
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,600
See? I'm right here,

390
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,000
sitting right in front of you.

391
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,760
Why did Lai Luozhi

392
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,960
abduct you all of a sudden?

393
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,480
I'm afraid Chui might

394
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,480
have been caught up in this because of me.

395
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,560
No,

396
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,520
that's not true.

397
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,000
Xing,

398
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,840
I'm really sorry,

399
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
but there's something

400
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,840
I've been

401
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,840
keeping from you.

402
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Actually,

403
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the friend I mentioned

404
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,280
from the Imperial Inspectorate

405
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,440
is none other than Lai Luozhi.

406
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,120
It's him?

407
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,480
At first,

408
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,920
I kept seeing him

409
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,040
at my mother's tomb.

410
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,680
I thought

411
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,920
he was a masked friend

412
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,760
who missed his late mother.

413
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,160
Later, he

414
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,360
happened to save me once,

415
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,840
and I...

416
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,480
I just...

417
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,840
The recipe of the antidote he provided

418
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,000
when your sister was poisoned

419
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,160
was indeed an authentic one.

420
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,800
He also cautioned me

421
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,640
not to speak of it to anyone.

422
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,840
I...

423
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,160
I thought I could take a chance,

424
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
wondering if he might

425
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,800
actually want to be a good person.

426
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,120
How could you possibly believe him,

427
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,040
Chui?

428
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,520
Have you been watching

429
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,240
too many operas?

430
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,040
How could you fall for his words?

431
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,440
Chui,

432
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,880
if Jiang Langxing and I have

433
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
shown up a little later,

434
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,680
you would have been forced

435
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
to marry the Dark Demon.

436
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,920
By the way,

437
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,760
Chui,

438
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,560
I remember your father

439
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,160
had spent a great fortune

440
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,760
on your mother's tomb.

441
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,720
Why does he

442
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,840
often visit there?

443
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,560
His mother's grave

444
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,920
just happens to be

445
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,400
near my mother's tomb.

446
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,920
I've visited it once,

447
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,280
and it appears to be a rather

448
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,840
unremarkable lone grave.

449
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,160
There's even a name on it,

450
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,160
called Bi Luo.

451
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,360
Bi Luo?

452
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,480
The name of

453
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,720
Lai Luozhi's mother

454
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,240
is surprisingly beautiful.

455
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,120
But I suspect he was merely

456
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
putting on a show of

457
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,040
filial piety for Chui.

458
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,040
I can't help but wonder that

459
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,840
Lai Luozhi's intentional moves

460
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
to get close to Chuí

461
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,560
are part of

462
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,520
a larger scheme.

463
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,960
By the way,

464
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,080
I think I spotted something

465
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,000
in Lai Luozhi's secret chamber.

466
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,240
It was the

467
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,200
coronation robe!

468
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,680
Lai Luozhi probably thought

469
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,360
I didn't know

470
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
much about it,

471
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,200
so he boldly

472
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,640
showed it off to me.

473
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,200
At first, I pretended to be indifferent,

474
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,520
but later,

475
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,800
when I took a closer look,

476
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,560
I noticed that it isn't embroidered

477
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,360
with loongs,

478
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,320
but Taotie!

479
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,880
The loong has nine sons,

480
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,280
and the fifth son, Taotie,

481
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,920
is the greediest of them all.

482
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,760
It seems that

483
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,840
Lai Luozhi's ambitions

484
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,160
are becoming increasingly clear.

485
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,680
I have pressing issues to attend to,

486
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,240
so I'll take my leave.

487
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,800
I'll go see him off.

488
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,600
Don't do it!

489
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,040
Have you forgotten about Sun Tan?

490
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,680
Sun Tan was well aware

491
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,000
that Lai Luozhi had ulterior motives,

492
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,160
but without solid evidence,

493
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,200
he could only die in vain.

494
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:40,799
Now we know exactly

495
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:41,960
that he possesses a coronation robe,

496
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,080
and you're going to stop me?

497
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,120
I understand your eagerness

498
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,520
to avenge Sun Tan,

499
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:46,839
but don't forget that

500
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,279
Chui was rescued by you last night.

501
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,319
Lai Luozhi knows very well

502
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,720
that she has seen that robe,

503
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,359
how could he not be on guard?

504
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,279
Is it harder to infiltrate the

505
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,359
Lai residence and the

506
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,359
Imperial Inspectorate than the palace?

507
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,880
There's no obstacle

508
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,319
I can't overcome

509
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,480
when I'm determined to steal.

510
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,480
I will turn over

511
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,640
every stone to uncover

512
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,880
what Lai Luozhi has hidden.

513
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,759
Your reputation as a master thief

514
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:09,080
is indeed well-deserved,

515
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,720
but the Lai residence and the

516
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,040
Imperial Inspectorate have likely

517
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,600
already set up a trap for you.

518
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,640
They are waiting for you to barge in.

519
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,799
It will be far more dangerous there

520
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:17,080
than in the palace!

521
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,080
Shen Du,

522
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
why have you become so hesitant?

523
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,520
Do men really change so drastically

524
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,560
after getting married?

525
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,000
I am afraid you'll soon

526
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,360
find yourself just like this too.

527
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,120
Xiang'an doesn't

528
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,880
smell quite right lately.

529
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,800
There are people from Nanlang and

530
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,240
Xichen everywhere in the alleys.

531
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,160
And they're all gathered at the corners,

532
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,600
looking to rent houses and shops.

533
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,600
It feels like something big is brewing!

534
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,640
We are keeping a close watch on them.

535
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,760
But the ones that can be kept track of

536
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,280
are likely just a handful.

537
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,480
Shen Du,

538
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,480
if anything happens to me,

539
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,400
please look after Yun Que for me.

540
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,400
Anything happens to me; do the same for me.

541
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,320
I'm off, Lord Commander.

542
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,200
Jin Zang,

543
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,240
play something light and cheerful.

544
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,120
Jin Zang!

545
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,200
Your Royal Highness...

546
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,440
Your Royal Highness!

547
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,600
I'm fine.

548
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,840
Today is the eighth day of the last month.

549
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,800
Her Highness should grant rewards.

550
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,920
Why is it already at this hour,

551
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,400
and she still hasn't appeared?

552
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Indeed,

553
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,200
Lord Shen hasn't shown up either.

554
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,360
Her Royal Highness feels unwell,

555
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,560
so today's rewarding ceremony

556
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,280
will be presided over by Chancellor Lai,

557
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,440
following last year's precedent.

558
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,040
He has the authority to decide as he sees fit.

559
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,440
Gratitude, Your Royal Highness.

560
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,000
We respectfully bid farewell to Your Majesty!

561
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,280
I'll temporarily act on behalf of Her Majesty

562
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,280
to oversee the rewards and penalties for

563
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,520
the officials based on performance.

564
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,680
How could Lai Luozhi be qualified

565
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,920
to assume this responsibility?

566
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,680
Exactly!

567
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,680
How could II, tasked with mere oversight,

568
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,320
possibly overstep its authority?

569
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,640
This is unacceptable!

570
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,160
This is a direct decree from Her Majesty.

571
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,800
Do you insist on troubling

572
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,120
her further while she is unwell?

573
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,560
You!

574
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,800
Or you!

575
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,080
Are you all

576
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,360
planning to defy the decree?

577
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,080
Chancellor Lai,

578
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm the Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Rites.

579
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,440
I am the scribe of the Ministry of War.

580
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,560
Reward!

581
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,000
Reward!

582
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,920
Reward! Reward!

583
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,040
Gratitude, Chancellor Lai!

584
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,240
Auntie.

585
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,080
Now that Mother is gravely ill,

586
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,840
she won't allow anyone to visit her.

587
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,080
Prince Xian's confinement hasn't been lifted yet,

588
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,960
and Lai Luozhi wields immense power.

589
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,160
Auntie!

590
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,800
Half of the officials have gone to

591
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,280
the Lai residence to pay loyalty, while

592
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,600
the other half are waiting for their fate.

593
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,280
The court is on the brink of chaos!

594
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
The court hasn't descended into chaos yet,

595
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,760
but your heart is already in turmoil.

596
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,560
When the heart is unsettled,

597
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
the spirit disperses.

598
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,520
Auntie,

599
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,000
how can my heart get settled?

600
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
No matter what,

601
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,480
you are still a princess;

602
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,440
Why are you so flustered?

603
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,280
Auntie,

604
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,720
you know better than anyone

605
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
how much weight

606
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,080
this title of princess carries.

607
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,600
The emperor still

608
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,160
cannot speak.

609
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,160
Despite the healers' claim of

610
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,320
"wisdom prefers a delayed speech,"

611
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,920
what if the emperor

612
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,520
remains unable to speak?

613
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,760
Now that Mother is gravely ill,

614
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,760
if anything were to happen...

615
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,960
Auntie,

616
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,800
then the position of regent

617
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,120
would become the key to

618
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,960
controlling the fate of the entire empire.

619
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,360
Do you want me to assist you?

620
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,440
Absolutely!

621
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,960
You just mentioned

622
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,840
how much weight

623
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,760
the title of princess carries.

624
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,000
I have practiced Dao for many years,

625
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
and the ways of the world are clear to me.

626
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,360
No matter what unfolds,

627
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,520
just remember this one thing:

628
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,240
support the Emperor diligently.

629
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,520
Auntie...

630
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,960
Ease your mind.

631
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,600
This

632
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,960
is just the beginning.
