1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:14,960
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:41,840 --> 00:02:00,300
Melody of Golden Age EP01

3
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,160
Practicing the pipa for an hour is more

4
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,320
tiring than examining corpses all day.

5
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,480
Xiao Qin,

6
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,080
can you fetch me some candied fruits?

7
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,760
Yes.

8
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Chief Shen.

9
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,360
What are you doing here?

10
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
This is the Shen residence.

11
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
I can be wherever

12
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
I want.

13
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
Yet you have really

14
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,720
taken yourself as the lady of the house,

15
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,600
giving orders late at night

16
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,840
for candied fruits and

17
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,840
playing that awful and disturbing tune.

18
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,160
I bought the candied fruits

20
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,200
myself from the West Street.

21
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
I'll get them myself next time.

22
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,600
I won't bother the servants here again.

23
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,040
As for the awful tune,

24
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
to make it less awful soon,

25
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,680
I can only practice all night

26
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
to get better.

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
So please bear with me.

28
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Performing arts require natural talent.

29
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,480
Last-minute efforts will only

30
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
make you a laughingstock.

31
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
I suggest you give up on the idea

32
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,200
of pretending to be a songstress soon.

33
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,800
And what if I succeed?

34
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,240
You still won't solve the case.

35
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Don't forget,

36
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,280
the killer targets a man and a woman.

37
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,160
Just you alone are not enough.

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,080
You'll need a man who's

39
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,040
so fallen for the singsong girls.

40
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
About that,

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
I do have someone in mind.

42
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,800
I'll have to trouble Chief Shen

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
to invite him over.

44
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,240
But... I...

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,280
Chief Clerk Wu,

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,960
I need you to

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,520
accompany Lady Shen

48
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,160
to the Kaiyang Festival today.

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,440
She specifically requested

50
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,680
you to be her beloved partner.

51
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Chief Shen, it's a misunderstanding.

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,840
I was wronged.

53
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,680
If, if you don't believe me,

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,320
ask in the Ministry of Justice,

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,080
We're not beloved partners,

56
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
rather, we are like oil and water.

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,000
We can't sit at the same table,

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
and we go against one another.

59
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
-I... -No need to be nervous, Chief Clerk.

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,520
Today,

61
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,200
she only needs to pretend to be

62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,120
your beautiful mistress.

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,880
Chief Shen,

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
but this is...

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,240
Why?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Chief Shen!

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,920
Don't drag me! Chief Shen!

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,040
Chief Shen!

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,400
Why me?

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Because your mistress is renowned

71
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,560
among the noblewomen of the capital

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,560
for her incomparable beauty.

73
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,200
You...

74
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,280
Let, let go.

75
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,040
Chief Shen,

76
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,000
Lady Shen rarely dresses up.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
She's quite attractive.

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
Instead of flattering me here,

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,640
go do something more useful.

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
Yes.

81
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Follow me.

82
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,880
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

83
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,320
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,800
At the Kaiyang Festival,

85
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,640
I'll escort Her Highness

86
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,120
for the street procession.

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,280
You must closely track the lady.

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
If you see anyone suspicious,

89
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
arrest him immediately.

90
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,160
If anything happens to her,

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,840
I'll hold you accountable.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,440
Long live the Emperor!

93
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,680
Long live

94
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,120
Your Highness!

95
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,000
Bravo!

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
What a show!

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
I wonder

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,600
if anyone else would like to

99
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,560
take the stage next?

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,240
Everyone,

101
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,840
my beloved concubine

102
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,880
is willing to play a pipa piece

103
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,760
for all of you.

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,960
Bravo! Bravo!

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
Wu Taiming

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
has the audacity to bring his mistress

107
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,720
into the open.

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,280
How can an unwed singsong girl

109
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,320
be considered a concubine?

110
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,280
How must Lady Wu feel?

111
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,400
Long live Your Majesty!

112
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,640
Long live

113
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,040
Your Highness!

114
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,400
I respectfully greet Your Majesty

115
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
and Your Highness.

116
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
Your Highness and Your Majesty

117
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,840
have come here personally

118
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,280
for the procession and to pray.

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,600
We pray for divine blessings,

120
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,600
that bring our nation prosperity

121
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,160
good weather,

122
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,920
and peace.

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,400
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

124
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,639
She's very good.

125
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,960
Look, it's the Splendid Phoenix!

126
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
The Splendid Phoenix.

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,120
-So beautiful! -What a divine bird!

128
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,240
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

129
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,880
This is Heaven's will!

130
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Heaven sends auspicious signs,

131
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,800
bringing blessings to Cang dynasty.

132
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,240
What is this strange

133
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,640
fragrance?

134
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
A thousand butterflies dance in the spring stars.

135
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,760
Hundred-branch night chamber's bell chime.

136
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,440
What a match!

137
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,520
Lady Shen!

138
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,240
Lady Shen!

139
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,440
Jing Lin.

140
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,160
Chief Shen,

141
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,320
Lady Shen and Wu Taiming are both missing.

142
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,040
Get on the horse.

143
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,600
Speak!

144
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,880
Who's the real killer behind the murders?

145
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,640
Murders?

146
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,800
What murders?

147
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Where's Lady Shen?

148
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,640
Please spare my life.

149
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
Chief Shen, please stop!

150
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,080
This was a family scandal.

151
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,280
My brother-in-law was cheating.

152
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,360
I was just teaching him a lesson.

153
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
Is that a crime?

154
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
The bodies found in pairs

155
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,840
knew each other

156
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
and were often seen together.

157
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
However, there are two pairs

158
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,240
where the victims

159
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,720
held grudges.

160
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,480
Oh no.

161
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm Shen Du.

162
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,360
Are you okay?

163
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Du!

164
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Du, do you still remember me?

165
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Of course I remember you.

166
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Yan Xing,

167
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
I won't forget you.

168
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,040
These aren't real.

169
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,720
Do I need to know you?

170
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Don't even dream of becoming

171
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
the real Lady Shen.

172
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,160
Don't expect to survive here

173
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,880
if you're not the one

174
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,080
I chose to marry.

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Where am I?

176
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
You don't need to know that.

177
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,080
Why did you kill all those people?

178
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,360
You don't need to know that, either.

179
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,560
Why do you

180
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,480
keep talking?

181
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I don't think I will

182
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,800
be able to get out of here today.

183
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,600
So why don't you uncover yourself

184
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,720
and let me see your face?

185
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,920
Everyone knows that you are

186
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,320
remarkably smart.

187
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,960
If I were to reveal

188
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,200
my face to you,

189
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,120
you'll surely

190
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,640
return as a ghost

191
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
and expose me to your husband.

192
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,960
What would I do then?

193
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,760
You killed all those people.

194
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,520
Their resentment

195
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,480
has long turned into vengeful ghosts

196
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
that haunt you

197
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,040
day and night.

198
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,160
Can't you feel it?

199
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
They were nothing!

200
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,240
They deserved to die!

201
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,920
Even as ghosts,

202
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,240
they still wouldn't dare

203
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,120
to haunt me.

204
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,520
Otherwise,

205
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,800
I'll just kill them again!

206
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
Do I deserve to die as well?

207
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,320
Those people you are talking about

208
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
all had something in common,

209
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,320
and you think they deserved to die.

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
But do I really deserve to die

211
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,720
in your eyes?

212
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,000
Even if you ask all these questions,

213
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,960
you still have to die.

214
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,640
But,

215
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,240
I'll have to

216
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,560
wait for a while

217
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
first.

218
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,520
What are you waiting for?

219
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm waiting

220
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,200
for the blood in your body to clot.

221
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,360
So when I take out your heart,

222
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,160
you won't bleed.

223
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,600
But I am the wife of Chief Shen.

224
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
If you kill me,

225
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,880
they'll find you,

226
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
and they won't let you off easily.

227
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,360
Even if I don't kill you,

228
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,440
when Shen Du catches me,

229
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,960
he still wouldn't let me go.

230
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,640
I'll die anyway.

231
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
Might as well

232
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,640
take Lady Shen

233
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,240
with me.

234
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,840
I can plead for you.

235
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,080
He'll leave your body intact.

236
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,320
We're very close to each other.

237
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,400
Everyone in Xiang’an knows that.

238
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,760
He'll listen to me.

239
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,640
He'll listen to me.

240
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
He'll listen to me.

241
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,200
He'll listen to me.

242
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,680
Shut up!

243
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,040
Shut up!

244
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,200
You shameless slut!

245
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
He won't listen to you!

246
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,320
He's mine!

247
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,760
Mine! Mine!

248
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,880
Stop!

249
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
Let go of me!

250
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,840
Xing,

251
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,240
are you okay?

252
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,080
Xing.

253
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,360
Thank you for getting here in time.

254
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,720
It was lucky

255
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,600
you sprinkled bean powder on your clothes.

256
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,159
The hunting dog followed the scent here.

257
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,520
How are you feeling?

258
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,480
I... I'm okay.

259
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,880
But...

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
Did you catch the killer?

261
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,120
But

262
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
I had a dream.

263
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,720
Jing Lin,

264
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,720
take off her veil.

265
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,120
It's you.

266
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,080
Xing.

267
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,960
Take her to the Imperial Guard.

268
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,160
Yes.

269
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Lat's go.

270
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,360
Yes.

271
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,280
Xing,

272
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,720
you're awake.

273
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Chuichui,

274
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,560
how long was I asleep?

275
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,960
Where is Lady Tang?

276
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,240
Did you interrogate her?

277
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,400
You only slept for an hour.

278
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
You just woke up and you're

279
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,720
asking these?

280
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,840
No wonder Shen Du asked me

281
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,080
to keep an eye on you.

282
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,280
So what happened?

283
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,200
Of course she won't admit anything.

284
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,840
But,

285
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,440
Her Highness went to the IG

286
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
to interrogate her herself.

287
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,720
Let's see if she'll give in then.

288
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,720
I'll go see now.

289
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,720
Don't.

290
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,280
The drug is still working.

291
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,960
I've been chasing her for a long time.

292
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,000
I know how to make her talk.

293
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,920
No way.

294
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,720
You almost died today.

295
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
They can make do without you.

296
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,720
Plus,

297
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,040
Shen Du asked me to watch you.

298
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,680
Are you my friend

299
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,120
or his friend?

300
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,120
Chuichui,

301
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
you know me.

302
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,800
Once I make a decision,

303
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,880
no one can stop me.

304
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,920
But right now,

305
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,480
you need to help me with something.

306
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,800
I truly didn't expect that

307
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,360
the one behind these dreadful crimes

308
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,280
would be the widow of

309
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,840
my loyal minister, Tang Chengyi.

310
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,800
Why did you do it?

311
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,080
I remember

312
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,880
you and this Lady Tang

313
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,240
were quite close.

314
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,960
Now that

315
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,640
she's the suspect of these murders,

316
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,480
Prince Ying,

317
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,080
do you know anything about it?

318
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,920
Your Majesty, please investigate thoroughly.

319
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Although I associated with

320
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Lady Tang,

321
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,000
I had no idea about

322
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,680
her killing people.

323
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,600
If I had known that

324
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,840
she was the killer,

325
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,240
I would've never got close to her.

326
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,840
Let me ask you,

327
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
why did you kill

328
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,360
so many innocent people?

329
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,960
They weren't innocent.

330
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,360
Cang Dynasty has its own laws.

331
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
You don't get to decide

332
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,320
if they were innocent or not.

333
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,320
I'm Yan Xing, a clerk in the Ministry of Justice.

334
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,240
I apology for my abruptness

335
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
and ask for Your Majesty's forgiveness.

336
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,440
I haven't managed my household well,

337
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,800
and have disturbed Your Majesty.

338
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
Please punish me as you see fit.

339
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,440
It's of no concern.

340
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,600
I have heard that Lady Shen is very

341
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,680
skilled in solving cases.

342
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,800
Now that Meng Ceran

343
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,760
refuses to confess,

344
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,840
do you have any insights on this?

345
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,280
Your Majesty,

346
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,360
all the men

347
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,520
Lady Tang had killed

348
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,760
were engaged,

349
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,960
yet they were drawn to the brothels

350
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,160
and singsong girls.

351
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,400
But the female victims

352
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,040
all shared similar appearances

353
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,280
and had the same hair style.

354
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,520
Moreover,

355
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,080
they were all good pipa players.

356
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,800
Shut up.

357
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,720
Who would believe

358
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,800
your nonsense?

359
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Your Majesty,

360
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
all the bodies found

361
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,080
were treated with cinnabar

362
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,320
to slow down decay,

363
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,200
making

364
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,880
the coroner's estimated time of death

365
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,600
inaccurate.

366
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,040
Later, we inferred

367
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,240
the correct date of death

368
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
and found it was all

369
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,000
within the Kaiyang period estimated by

370
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,040
the Imperial Astrology Bureau for that year.

371
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,280
Lady Tang,

372
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,760
did you really do

373
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,120
all of this for just

374
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,920
a momentary satisfaction in your heart?

375
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,720
At first,

376
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,240
I thought your killings

377
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,000
were driven by similarities

378
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,360
in the victims' appearances.

379
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,640
But later, I realized

380
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
it was more about

381
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
a deep obsession

382
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,840
with their identities.

383
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,200
I suspect that

384
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,360
the kind of women you killed

385
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,160
were likely connected to

386
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,800
someone very close to you.

387
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,880
You shut up!

388
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,040
Were you through traumas?

389
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,040
Or

390
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,400
did you suffer from the relationship

391
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,960
with some man from the pleasure quarters

392
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,320
on the day of the Kaiyang festival?

393
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,800
Nonsense!

394
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
If one wishes to fabricate a crime,

395
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,040
reasons can always be found.

396
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,960
By the way,

397
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,760
recently,

398
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,600
you have caught a chill at night.

399
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,760
With the weather getting cooler,

400
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,520
you need to be more careful.

401
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm much better already.

402
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,080
My Lady,

403
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,880
if you care for me more often,

404
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
then I won't catch a cold anymore.

405
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
But

406
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,240
you've just got frightened,

407
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,000
why not take some rest?

408
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,560
I'm just

409
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,920
worried about you.

410
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,160
Chief Shen,

411
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,120
do you think the IG is your home?

412
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,480
Lady Shen has even treated this place

413
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
as if it were her own bedroom.

414
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,080
I am very pleased to

415
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,000
see the deep bond between you two.

416
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,320
But, Lay Shen,

417
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,800
the case is more important now.

418
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,680
You need to focus on the case.

419
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,760
Yes, I understand.

420
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,840
The Delinquent Xu Xiangren wishes to meet.

421
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,400
I, the Delinquent Xu Xiangren,

422
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
greet Your Highness.

423
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,040
Xing.

424
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,440
I take my leave.

425
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,720
Actually,

426
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,680
the delinquents

427
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,280
have found another pair of bodies.

428
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,800
This is the portrait

429
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
I created to reconstruct

430
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,440
the face of the male victim.

431
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,640
Give me that.

432
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,160
Give me!

433
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,080
Give me!

434
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,920
I was correct.

435
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,960
You are the real victim

436
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,840
in your heart, aren't you?

437
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,320
What do you know!

438
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,360
It's not my fault.

439
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
They failed me first.

440
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,920
It's them!

441
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,520
It's all their fault.

442
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,600
I was so good to him.

443
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,360
Why did he betray me?

444
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,600
Is the person you speak of

445
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
the one in the portrait—

446
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,240
your first husband?

447
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Yes.

448
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,000
When I was young,

449
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,400
my sister was kidnapped.

450
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,760
When we met again,

451
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,840
she had become a singsong girl

452
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,040
playing pipa.

453
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,600
At that time,

454
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,680
I was already married.

455
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,760
But I never thought that

456
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,920
on the day of the Kaiyang Festival,

457
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,760
on the Kaiyang Festival, I found

458
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,320
her having an affair with my husband.

459
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,840
The two people I loved the most.

460
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,880
The two people I trusted the most.

461
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,480
They both betrayed me.

462
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,680
To maintain my dignity,

463
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
I gave her poisoned wine.

464
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,680
But I didn't expect that

465
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
my husband

466
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,840
would drink it instead.

467
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,880
No!

468
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,720
After my husband's dead,

469
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,840
my sister went missing as well.

470
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,520
I looked for her for so long.

471
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
But in the end,

472
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,040
I found her in a grave.

473
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,000
But they...

474
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,360
They

475
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,520
were still holding each other tightly!

476
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,840
No.

477
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
It's not true.

478
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,240
It's not true.

479
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,240
It's not true.

480
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,680
It's not true!

481
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,080
That despicable woman!

482
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,920
She was not my sister!

483
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,000
She's just...

484
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,280
She's just a singsong girl who

485
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,800
seduced my husband.

486
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,080
She deserved to die!

487
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,680
She could've been a good woman.

488
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,320
But she had to seduce

489
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,760
a married man!

490
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,600
She deserved to be torn to pieces!

491
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,480
She deserved to be flayed alive!

492
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,600
She deserved to be humiliated

493
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,680
and disgraced by the world!

494
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
That's why you killed

495
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,920
all those women who looked like

496
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,240
your sister?

497
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,600
Does it look good?

498
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,720
Yes.

499
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,320
They deserved to die.

500
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,840
And those men.

501
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Why did they have to obsess with

502
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,440
those singsong girls?

503
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,920
In this world,

504
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,320
not everyone

505
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
has the right to choose their life!

506
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Many of them were

507
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,120
born into the pleasure quarters.

508
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,560
They can only use their looks.

509
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,680
They have no other choice!

510
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,600
Moreover,

511
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,360
that's not a reason

512
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,960
for you to kill them!

513
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,400
At first,

514
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,960
I've also blamed myself.

515
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
If it weren't for me,

516
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,040
my sister wouldn't have died.

517
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,400
Neither would my husband.

518
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,120
If it weren't for

519
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,520
my impulsiveness,

520
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,400
I wouldn't have lost

521
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,720
both of my loved ones at the same time.

522
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,240
That's why you regretted it.

523
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,440
You made the bodies

524
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
embrace each other

525
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,160
to comfort yourself.

526
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,600
Lady Shen,

527
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,080
you are indeed very smart.

528
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,680
Straight to the point.

529
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,080
But do you think,

530
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,520
with only your intelligence

531
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,320
you can

532
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,360
keep a man's heart forever?

533
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,160
Do you think

534
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,640
he'll always protect you like this?

535
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,280
He says he loves you,

536
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,240
but he only loves himself!

537
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,560
He will lie to you!

538
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,280
He will lie to you

539
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,520
and leave you heartbroken

540
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,800
and devastated.

541
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,440
What's wrong with loving oneself?

542
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,840
Everyone should love themselves

543
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,040
before they love someone.

544
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
In a marriage,

545
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,520
no one should

546
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,800
simply demand,

547
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,720
or ask single-sided protection.

548
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
But the husband and the wife should

549
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,160
face the challenges together

550
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,480
and support each other.

551
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,040
That's how a family

552
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,280
should be like!

553
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,440
Your Highness,

554
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,680
now that the case is solved

555
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,280
and the killer has confessed,

556
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,080
it's your decision to make as to

557
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,480
what to do with Lady Tang.

558
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,600
Your Highness,

559
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
in my humble opinion,

560
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,800
the killer has turned into madness.

561
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
I urge Your Highness not to be

562
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,600
swayed by past sentiments

563
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,640
and to close the case swiftly.

564
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,800
Since she's the widow of a loyal minister,

565
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,120
keep her body intact.

566
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,280
Yes.

567
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,040
Like a moth to a flame,

568
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,120
her life is fleeting.

569
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,320
She is beyond reincarnation.

570
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,040
Her afterlife shall continue.

571
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,760
Jing Lin,

572
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,520
put out the fire!

573
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,280
Yes!

574
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,400
Isn't this exactly what Chen Huo'e,

575
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
who was executed five years ago,

576
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,840
said right before he died?

577
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,480
Get this madwoman out of here!

578
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,200
Yes.

579
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,600
Were you this meddlesome

580
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,080
since you were a child?

581
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,440
It was life and death,

582
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,400
how could it be meddlesome?

583
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,960
I know

584
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,760
you especially asked Chuichui to

585
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,800
look after me today.

586
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,640
But if I hadn't barged into the court,

587
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,880
how could Lady Tang's case

588
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,760
have been so easily

589
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,600
concluded?

590
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,360
Today, you...

591
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,200
did good.

592
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,840
You,

593
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,360
are not going to scold me?

594
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,799
Did you make up the

595
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,520
two newly found bodies?

596
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:45,239
I merely asked Xu Xiangren

597
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,400
to go get the portrait

598
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,920
of Lady Tang's first husband

599
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,040
to provoke her to tell the truth.

600
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,440
Now we know the truth.

601
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,239
It's just...

602
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,200
It's just, it feels like

603
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,360
we've missed something about this case.

604
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
What did we miss?

605
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,840
The hearts.

606
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,840
Lady Tang killed this many people

607
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,799
and has taken their hearts.

608
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,520
So where are these hearts?

609
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,600
Lady Tang,

610
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,880
I have something important for you.

611
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,560
Killing is easy.

612
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,800
But moving the bodies,

613
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,840
digging the graves,

614
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,840
reburying them

615
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,200
are not things a woman

616
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,520
can easily manage.

617
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,280
You must have help.

618
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,800
What is

619
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,560
all this effort for?

620
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,920
Like a moth to the flame.

621
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
Like a moth to the flame.

622
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,200
She's turned into madness.

623
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,880
But she's the most important witness.

624
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,040
How come she turned mad?

625
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,880
I will never die.

626
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,920
I will become a moth

627
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,800
and live forever!

628
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,920
I'm flying.

629
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,360
I'm flying.

630
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,600
You killed all those people.

631
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,080
Where are their hearts?

632
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,040
I'm flying.

633
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,840
-Meng Ceran. -I'm flying.

634
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
Please burn me.

635
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Please.

636
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,440
I want to rise from the ashes.

637
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,200
I want to rise from the ashes.

638
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,080
I'm begging you, please.

639
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,920
Ask her no more.

640
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,280
She's a madwoman now.

641
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Nothing a madwoman says

642
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,960
will be credible.

643
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,000
Burn me. Burn me!

644
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,240
She will be executed soon.

645
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,040
Burn me!

646
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,080
Burn me!

647
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,320
What are you thinking about?

648
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,920
I'm thinking about Lady Tang's case.

649
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,960
Her love turned to hatred,

650
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,280
then into obsession.

651
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,480
Yet she was torn between love and hate,

652
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,720
unable to let it go.

653
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,440
It's truly a pity.

654
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,880
To devote oneself entirely

655
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,160
in a love affair

656
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,800
is the act of a fool.

657
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,480
And the world is full of

658
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,200
foolish people acting wickedly.

659
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,960
What's there to pity about?

660
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,480
Yeah.

661
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,000
That sounds exactly what a smart

662
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,160
person like you would say.

663
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,520
Chief Shen,

664
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,720
I'm tired.

665
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,760
I'll rest a bit now.

666
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,040
Prince Xian has finished

667
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
the disaster relief work

668
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,040
and will arrive safely

669
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,440
in Xiang'an soon.

670
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,240
That's good.

671
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,480
No need

672
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,720
to hang around the pigeon coop anymore.

673
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,440
You got false information,

674
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,680
as the IG don't use carrier pigeons

675
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,240
for their secret messages.

676
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,800
I know.

677
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,320
Those pigeons are all soft feathered

678
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,600
and can't fly long-distance.

679
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,800
But I have to walk around here

680
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,320
from time to time.

681
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,440
You have your orders to follow,

682
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,320
and I have mine too.

683
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,720
I have to pretend anyway.

684
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,920
But I won't really do anything.

685
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,800
Don't worry.

686
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,160
So now can you believe that even

687
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,080
beasts won't harm their cubs, right?

688
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,920
Let alone it's the

689
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,240
mightiest beast...

690
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,120
Stop.

691
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,240
I don't want to hear that.

692
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,960
I won't hear what I shouldn't hear,

693
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,240
no need to invite trouble.

694
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,120
By the way,

695
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,320
I forgot to tell you about

696
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
a small thing.

697
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
The Ministry of Justice and the Delinquents

698
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,440
are hosting a celebration banquet

699
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,520
and have sent an invitation

700
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,920
to invite both of us.

701
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,160
-I know

702
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,040
you won't be going.

703
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,520
I'm just telling you.

704
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,160
Jinglin.

705
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,440
Yes, my lord.

706
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
Tell Zhong,

707
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,680
the blinds he made last time,

708
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,440
make another one.

709
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,360
Yes, Chief Shen.

710
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
Such a promising bloom.

711
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,680
What a waste.

712
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,800
Your Majesty.

713
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,720
Master.

714
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,480
Your Majesty’s contributions to

715
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,720
disaster relief are praised.

716
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,600
I've heard that Her Highness

717
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,160
plans to reward you greatly.

718
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,000
Did the journey back go well?

719
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Master, don't worry.

720
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,640
I had the IG's thorough escort

721
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
in the journey.

722
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,200
I brought back

723
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,720
some local specialties this time.

724
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,040
Prepare one portion

725
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,400
for the master.

726
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,440
And prepare another

727
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,920
for my royal sister,

728
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,640
as

729
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,720
a gesture of

730
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,320
my regard to her.

731
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,640
Yes.

732
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,200
Your Majesty, your kindness

733
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
and strong sibling bond

734
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,040
truly move me.

735
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,960
However, recently

736
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,280
due to Lady Tang's case,

737
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,880
it's going to be tough for Prince Ying.

738
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,600
I've also heard about this

739
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,880
on the way.

740
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,480
My sister has always

741
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,720
been close to Lady Tang and

742
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,000
they both supported the poor,

743
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,880
but the current public opinion

744
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,920
is very unfavorable to them.

745
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,960
Yeah.

746
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,280
Regarding Lady Tang's case,

747
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,720
who would've thought

748
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,080
that Yan Xing would

749
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,320
made a great contribution.

750
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,600
She's just a concubine's daughter,

751
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,360
often quite unreliable.

752
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,680
But she proved to be

753
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,600
capable at a critical moment like this.

754
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,040
Prince Xian,

755
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,560
do you think this Yan Xing

756
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,080
is suitable?

757
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,080
If you think so, master,

758
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,120
then it must be right.

759
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,600
Perhaps,

760
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,160
we'll truly have to rely on her

761
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,240
to resolve the stalemate.

762
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,240
This flower needs fertilizer.

763
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,400
Your Majesty,

764
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,000
many of the ladies who

765
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,880
were invited to the flower banquet

766
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,560
said they were ill and won't come.

767
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,880
I got it.

768
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,240
Those who don't want to come

769
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,920
won't have to come in the future anymore.

770
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,280
They're all useless to me.
