Melody of Golden Age EP26

3
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,320
Lord Shen,

4
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,280
today's welcome banquet

5
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,480
is likely to be called off.

6
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,280
Mr. Pan

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
has uncovered a key figure

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
in the headless corpse case.

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,880
Who is it?

10
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,160
His name is Liu Zongyuan,

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
the neighboring tenant farmer of

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,360
the deceased, Li Kaixiang.

13
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
After the incident,

14
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,440
I discovered that many of the deceased's

15
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,760
land had come under his control.

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,400
So I went to his home to investigate

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,480
and found that he

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,600
had just moved away recently.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Lord Mo,

20
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,480
could you please send someone

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,759
to look into his whereabouts?

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,319
It would be best if we could capture him.

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,520
OK.

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,840
Lord Commander,

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I sincerely apologize.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,760
This is indeed an unforeseen circumstance.

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,400
I hope you understand, Lord Shen.

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,560
Investigation is of utmost importance,

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,040
Lord Mo need not feel guilty.

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
Since he left not long ago,

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,680
and it is quite a distance from the city,

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,240
why not issue a city lockdown order?

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
I'll have guardsmen intensify the search.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,040
perhaps we can catch him.

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,720
My lord, you're absolutely correct.

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,240
I will instruct Biqiu to draft a

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
city lockdown order immediately.

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,320
I hope we can soon capture the murderer

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,280
and bring him to justice.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,040
If we can also put an end to the rumors

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,000
about the masked spectre

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
devouring people in their sleep,

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,320
that would be even better.

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm afraid I'll be returning late tonight,

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,960
so don't wait for me.

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,440
Let's get going.

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
I'll take my leave.

48
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
It's still early,

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,760
how about we pay a visit to Li Kairui

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,640
in the jail?

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,720
We've scoured all the streets

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
in the city, but

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,760
there's still no trace of Liu Zongyuan.

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
He must have either fled the city

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,720
or is hiding in some residence

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,760
within the city.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,440
We have already issued orders

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,240
to lock the city gates

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,520
and set up checkpoints along the routes.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,600
The likelihood of Liu Zongyuan

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,960
escaping the city

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
is very low.

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,240
Lord Mo,

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,480
I recommend that

65
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,600
we conduct another thorough search of

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,080
the courtyards where he might be hiding.

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
We'd be wise to avoid doing so.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
The citizens in the city

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,480
are already

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,600
feeling uneasy

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
due to the recent murders.

72
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
If they see the authority

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
searching homes at night,

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,160
it will only heighten their fears.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,760
You've seen it yourself,

76
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,160
The gates have checkpoints in place.

77
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,840
My men will thoroughly inspect everyone.

78
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
He won't be able to slip away.

79
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,520
Go ahead and enter.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,840
Next!

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Sign here.

82
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
What do you have in your bag?

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,360
The garrison at Yingzhou

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,639
is indeed well-disciplined

85
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,600
and equipped.

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,280
It seems the commander has invested ample

87
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,080
effort and resources into the troops.

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,680
Their breastplates and shoulder guards

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
are of outstanding quality,

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,160
unlike those of ordinary border soldiers.

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,880
You come from the imperial capital.

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080
You must have seen

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,240
plenty of top-notch military equipment.

94
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,400
These mediocre armors of mine

95
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
are nothing to boast about.

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,440
This city

97
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,200
is situated on the western frontier,

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,560
and defense is our top priority!

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,600
We are cutting costs wherever possible,

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,840
and all the savings I can muster

101
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
are directed towards military supplies.

102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,040
We're quite constrained in this regard.

103
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,240
Lord Shen,

104
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
we have located him.

105
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,240
This lady

106
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,840
is a scribe from the Ministry of Justice.

107
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,000
She has some questions for you.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
My lady,

109
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,560
I'm innocent, my lady!

110
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,080
There's no need to plead with me now.

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,160
Just answer

112
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,360
all my questions.

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,160
As long as you can clear my name,

114
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm willing to

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
do anything!

116
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,680
Do you know

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,560
Liu Zongyuan?

118
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,040
Yes, he has

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,520
a good relationship with my brother.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
On the day of the incident,

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,200
I had invited him and my brother

122
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
to drink together, but he

123
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,240
left in the middle due to some business.

124
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
As a result,

125
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,320
no one can prove

126
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,400
my innocence!

127
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
Do you know

128
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,880
where he is from?

129
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,840
I only know he is a merchant

130
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,800
and has assisted my brother

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
with business strategies.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
Does Liu Zongyuan know martial arts?

133
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,320
No,

134
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
he is just a merchant.

135
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,920
Are you certain?

136
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
I remember one time

137
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,800
a snake entered his house,

138
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,520
and it was my brother who helped catch it!

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Lady Yan,

140
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,080
what are you jotting down?

141
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,360
Just taking some notes.

142
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
And I have a sketch of the masked spectre.

143
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,800
It's something

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
I drew from my imagination.

145
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,240
So Lady Yan

146
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,600
has such artistic talent too?

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,840
Then let me see

148
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,760
what this masked spectre

149
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
looks like in your imagination.

150
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,320
You can look at it later,

151
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,760
but right now,

152
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,160
it might be quite unsettling!

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,760
What if we really

154
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,440
summon it here?

155
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
Then we might not survive!

156
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
That's a valid concern.

157
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,960
After your brother passed away, there

158
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,320
was initially nothing at the incision,

159
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
but suddenly one day,

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,520
the incision

161
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
started showing

162
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,120
some of his own misdeeds.

163
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,840
Are you aware of this?

164
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,240
I don't know!

165
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,440
I don't know anything!

166
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
Since you don't know,

167
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,320
then accompany us

168
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,200
to examine the body.

169
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,400
It just so happens that these misdeeds

170
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,760
are not very clear to us either,

171
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,200
and you can

172
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,760
clarify a thing or two.

173
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,040
-Guards! -My lord.

174
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
No, no!

175
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,720
I really don't want to see it!

176
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,040
That would be too horrifying,

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
I truly can't bear to look!

178
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,400
Besides,

179
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,320
that's still my own brother...

180
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,040
Since he is your brother,

181
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,400
you should go and see for yourself.

182
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
You've been crying out for justice.

183
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
We are just investigating the case,

184
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,040
so there's no need to be so nervous.

185
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Please...

186
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I beg you!

187
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
I am seriously begging you!

188
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,320
I... I'll tell you!

189
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,160
I'll tell you!

190
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,440
My brother did

191
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,440
some foolish things in the past,

192
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,840
but he doesn't deserve this!

193
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
When my brother was young,

194
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,880
he had a gambling addiction

195
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
and lost all our family's wealth.

196
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
He later realized his errors and quit gambling.

197
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,680
Then he started a small business

198
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,040
and even made some money.

199
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,040
But lately, he had been borrowing money

200
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,840
and even mortgaged our land.

201
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
We suspect

202
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,760
he has started gambling again.

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Who would have thought

204
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
he actually believed

205
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,760
the words of the charlatan

206
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,840
and spent all his money on some elixirs!

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Because of this,

208
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
I had a fall out with my brother.

209
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,799
Before long,

210
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,159
the neighbor who introduced the quack,

211
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,000
Liu Zongyuan,

212
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,120
showed up at

213
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Dafu's teahouse.

214
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,120
Well, look who it is, Liu Zongyuan!

215
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
Gentlemen,

216
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
please try to stay calm!

217
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,480
I'm not here

218
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,000
to provoke you,

219
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,720
but rather to discuss something important!

220
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,240
We have nothing to discuss with you.

221
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,480
If it weren't for you

222
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,520
introducing that quack

223
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,040
to my brother,

224
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,040
would my brother have ended up

225
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
in this situation?

226
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,440
How dare you even show your face here?

227
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,360
Look at what you've done

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
to his brother!

229
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
He even sold all his land!

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
How could you do something like this?

231
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
Do you have no conscience at all?

232
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,520
As for that quack,

233
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,280
I only mentioned him in passing,

234
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,120
as a curious tale to share.

235
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
I never imagined

236
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,440
Mr. Li would become so

237
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,560
obsessed that he would sell his land!

238
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,280
I deeply regret it!

239
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,720
Now all I

240
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
can do is

241
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
help him minimize his losses.

242
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,360
These days,

243
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,000
I've been managing his business for him.

244
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,960
Also,

245
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,640
I've managed to help him

246
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,400
reclaim all the land

247
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
he had sold off.

248
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,080
It's now all registered under his name.

249
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,680
If you have any doubts,

250
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,800
I can show you the documents as proof.

251
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,720
Dafu, so...

252
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,120
So Liu Zongyuan was indeed a decent man.

253
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,280
We agreed to meet in two days

254
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,760
to share a drink with my brother

255
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,520
and encourage him to turn his life around.

256
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,120
By the way, Mr. Ji,

257
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,760
I just remembered

258
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,160
there are some business matters

259
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm not entirely clear on,

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
and I'd like to seek your advice.

261
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
Shall we step aside for a moment?

262
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,240
Absolutely.

263
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,840
Help yourselves, gentlemen.

264
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,360
We'll step out to discuss,

265
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
and then we'll return to join you.

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,480
Excuse us,

267
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
gentlemen.

268
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
I understood that

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,720
they were deliberately

270
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,400
creating a chance

271
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
for us brothers to be alone,

272
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,160
so I could have a heart-to-heart with him.

273
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,640
Here,

274
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,560
Kaixiang.

275
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,920
Kaixiang,

276
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,280
look at yourself,

277
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,800
what has happened to you?

278
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,040
You've lost so much weight in just days!

279
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
From now on,

280
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
don't fall for the

281
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
quack's deceitful words.

282
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,320
Taking care of yourself

283
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,560
is far more important!

284
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,160
Little brother,

285
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,000
you don't get it.

286
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
Mr. Yuan truly has extraordinary powers.

287
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,400
He can summon deities to descend.

288
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,920
I've witnessed it with my own eyes!

289
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
Kairui, listen to me.

290
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
You shouldn't get caught up

291
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
in those trivial matters.

292
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,880
Join me in pursuing immortality.

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
Imagine achieving eternal life!

294
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,880
What deities descending,

295
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,760
what eternal life?

296
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,800
Those are just tricks to deceive people!

297
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,160
Kaixiang,

298
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,480
after all these years,

299
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
we've sacrificed so much, and you...

300
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,240
How could you so easily believe

301
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,280
in such nonsense?

302
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,840
And still be so obsessed with it?

303
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,600
Do you think our parents

304
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
in heaven would approve of this?

305
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,080
Do you think you can justify

306
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,720
all the sacrifices we've made?

307
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,440
That's enough!

308
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,560
You're the one being foolish!

309
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,720
You don't even believe your own brother!

310
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,160
Could I ever deceive you?

311
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,040
Since we can't find common ground,

312
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,760
what's the point of continuing the subject?

313
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,720
Kaixiang,

314
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,640
you...

315
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
After that,

316
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,760
I ended up imprisoned until now.

317
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,240
Waking up to such a scene,

318
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,160
I truly can't make sense of

319
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,480
what happened that day!

320
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,680
Lady Yan,

321
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,640
I think it's about time,

322
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,760
we should get going.

323
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,680
About time?

324
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,080
For what?

325
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,720
But first,

326
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,560
you need to get changed.

327
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,000
Why did you bring me

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,880
to a place like this?

329
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
I got some leads in here, of course.

330
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,800
The top courtesan's schedule is hard to book.

331
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,200
let's enter.

332
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,800
Mr. Pan,

333
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
you are finally here!

334
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,960
The private suite is ready for you.

335
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,280
This way, please.

336
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
This way.

337
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,640
Excellent, I am most joyous!

338
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
Let's enjoy a few more drinks!

339
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,360
Please.

340
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,280
Mr. Pan,

341
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,160
make yourselves comfortable here.

342
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,040
Xiu will be here shortly!

343
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,360
Like a dream, a fairy, suddenly fading away;

344
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,720
where's the evening glow gone, leaving the screen empty?

345
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,800
Mr. Pan, aren't you something!

346
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,000
You seem to know people everywhere.

347
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
It looks like

348
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,040
you're quite the regular here, huh?

349
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,720
I only come here for investigation,

350
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,920
nothing more.

351
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,360
Since Xiu is the top courtesan,

352
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
she must be gorgeous.

353
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm curious to see

354
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,680
the enchanting beauties of Gannan,

355
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
and how they compare to those in Xiang'an.

356
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,840
"The lotus fades in comparison to your charm,"

357
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,680
"and the breeze brings the scent of jewels."

358
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,800
In your poem,

359
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,080
the autumn breeze wafts,

360
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
the aroma of the lotus fills the air,

361
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
yet even the dew-kissed lotus pales,

362
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,920
before the beauty standing near,

363
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,040
the wind carries her scent,

364
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,000
more pure and clear.

365
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,880
However,

366
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,240
who is this sentiment

367
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,520
of yours for?

368
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
Like a lotus, she twirls in her dance,

369
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,560
a spectacle the world has yet to witness.

370
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,960
Who this sentiment is for doesn't matter;

371
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,520
what truly matters is

372
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,160
the beauty is right in front of me,

373
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,880
yet she remains unaware of my feelings.

374
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,880
Miss Xiu,

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,640
please give me some leads

376
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,400
on Liu Zongyuan.

377
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,080
Where's the poem I asked you to compose?

378
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,480
Rest assured, I'd never forget.

379
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,120
Mr. Pan's instructions

380
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,200
Xiu has committed to memory.

381
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,920
When Liu Zongyuan first visited,

382
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,240
he could barely cover the tea fares

383
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,640
in the hall.

384
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,360
However,

385
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm not sure when it all began,

386
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,520
but he has become quite lavish,

387
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,720
often insisting on my company.

388
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,520
Let me tell you,

389
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,880
their family

390
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,680
is filled with fools.

391
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,360
I managed to trick them with

392
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,080
just a few handwritten notes!

393
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,040
His brother and brother-in-law

394
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,200
really need a reality check.

395
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,080
Maybe they should invest in some elixirs?

396
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,000
You're quite the con artist!

397
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,520
Liu Zongyuan

398
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,800
must have colluded with con artists

399
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,520
to seize other people's wealth.

400
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
So it seems

401
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,640
Liu Zongyuan is the biggest beneficiary

402
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,040
after Li Kaixiang's death.

403
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,400
Step by step, he had

404
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
encroached on the Li family's assets

405
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
until he has completely drained them

406
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,440
and finally fled.

407
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,920
He may have severed the head of the corpse

408
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,600
perhaps to

409
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,960
divert all the clues

410
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,560
to the masked spectre,

411
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,280
creating panic

412
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,560
to mislead our judgment.

413
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Xiu and Pan Chi

414
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,760
haven't known each other for long,

415
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,120
so why does she

416
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,520
trust him so deeply

417
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,080
to share so much?

418
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,199
While you were watering the flowers,

419
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
I composed a new poem.

420
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,080
After the rain, flowers bloom so light,

421
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,040
in the cool summer, they stand so bright.

422
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,160
Lotuses on the pond, unstained by dust,

423
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,920
tired of watching,

424
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,160
A butterfly, content and wild.

425
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,840
Leaves shimmer in the breeze,

426
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,080
a gentle touch,

427
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
A fragrance wafts, so delicate and such.

428
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,600
A graceful maiden with a coiled bun,

429
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,680
discreetly forms the style,

430
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,720
a crimson hue, so fine.

431
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
You two, make sure to

432
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,600
keep this "gentleman" entertained.

433
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,600
Greetings, beautiful young man.

434
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
You are...

435
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,600
It seems the boss lady

436
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
is quite the veteran.

437
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,120
She can easily see through

438
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
your disguise.

439
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,200
Here, beautiful young man.

440
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,200
Let me raise a toast to you.

441
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,560
You've worked hard on your investigations,

442
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,960
so it's nice to take a break.

443
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,880
Drink up.

444
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
I...

445
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
Lord Shen?

446
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
What brings you here?

447
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,640
Please, let me explain.

448
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
We went to the Scent Pavilion

449
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
solely for the purpose of investigation!

450
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,720
Those hetaera

451
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,640
were not summoned by me;

452
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,120
I didn't even lay a finger on them.

453
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,160
I trust you.

454
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm not upset about that.

455
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,520
It's just that in the future,

456
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,080
if you plan to investigate at night,

457
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,720
let me know.

458
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,000
When I couldn't find you at home,

459
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
I worried something had happened to you.

460
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,800
I was called away unexpectedly.

461
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,040
Next time,

462
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,800
I will definitely

463
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
give you a heads-up.

464
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,840
By the way,

465
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,640
have you managed to locate Liu Zongyuan?

466
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,520
He defrauded and seized the Lis' land,

467
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,400
and he is likely the one

468
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,880
responsible for Li Kaixiang's murder.

469
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,640
We've tracked him down.

470
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,560
Let's return and start the interrogation.

471
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,200
But he's already dead,

472
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,120
so he probably can't provide any answers.

473
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,120
Liu Zongyuan lost his liver,

474
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,320
and the liver

475
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,400
was likely removed from here.

476
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,480
All that laugh, like moths drawn to the flame.

477
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,920
But they do not realize that like mayflies,

478
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,320
fleeting in life, they do not enter the cycle of reincarnation.

479
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,960
Moths that brave the fire do not perish,

480
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
but are reborn anew.

481
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,120
Man's guise, beast's core,

482
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,200
Guilt unescapable, from the start.

483
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,480
Disrespecting the fire moth

484
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,560
brings disaster from above.

485
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,440
Not masked spectre, Fire Moth Sect again!

486
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Liu Zongyuan

487
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,320
was someone who practiced martial arts.

488
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,080
Look at the calluses on his palms.

489
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,960
It appears that

490
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,280
Liu Zongyuan

491
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,360
was intentionally feigning

492
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,520
ignorance of martial arts.

493
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,680
He was masquerading as a merchant,

494
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,840
while secretly committing murder,

495
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
but later he was silenced.

496
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,240
Perhaps

497
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,200
we're overcomplicating things.

498
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,360
There's a more straightforward way

499
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,200
to identify the true culprit.

500
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
Liu Zongyuan swindled

501
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,920
the Lis' land, forcing Li Kaixiang

502
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,640
to borrow money from everywhere.

503
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,280
Who suffered the most from this?

504
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,360
Li Kaixiang is dead,

505
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,680
and Li Kairui is imprisoned.

506
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,760
So that leaves only...

507
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,440
Ji Dafu!

508
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,360
Exactly.

509
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,560
I've always had a lingering doubt.

510
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,520
Liu Zongyuan, with his forged documents,

511
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
falsely claimed that

512
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,640
he had helped Li Kaixiang

513
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
retrieve the land he sold,

514
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,720
and he actually managed to deceive Ji Dafu,

515
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,480
making him believe

516
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,720
that he was a good person.

517
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
After all, Ji Dafu

518
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,480
runs a tea house.

519
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,800
Wouldn't he have doubts

520
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,280
about such a selfless act?

521
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,480
Either Ji Dafu is

522
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
incredibly gullible,

523
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,000
or...

524
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,840
Or

525
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,160
he never intended

526
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
to believe

527
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
Liu Zongyuan's claims.

528
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,920
From the very start,

529
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,120
he wanted to take revenge on Liu Zongyuan

530
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,880
for defrauding the Lis' wealth.

531
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,080
Now that we know Ji Dafu is a suspect,

532
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,600
why don't we

533
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,000
start investigating him?

534
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,760
What are you saying?

535
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,240
What do you want?

536
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,280
Don't you push me!

537
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,800
Out of my sight!

538
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,600
My lord,

539
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,920
you have to help me!

540
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,160
They are being unreasonable

541
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,320
and bullying me!

542
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,520
We have important matters to attend to.

543
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,280
Hands off!

544
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,200
At least help me find a fair solution.

545
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,600
You should report this

546
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,040
to the authorities.

547
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,680
The governor will

548
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
surely see to it that justice is done.

549
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,560
You are right!

550
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,040
I should report this to the authorities.

551
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,520
What am I even doing in here?

552
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,080
Who are you exactly?

553
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,920
We're just returning to visit family and

554
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,320
have some important matters to attend to,

555
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,800
so we won't take up more of your time.

556
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,080
Farewell!

557
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's go.

558
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,640
We, the Delinquents,

559
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,440
are honored to meet Lady Yan,

560
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Lord Commander.

561
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,280
Regarding earlier,

562
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,880
what was that?

563
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,160
I am Sun Tan, the leader of

564
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,880
the Delinquents in Gannan.

565
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,960
What just happened

566
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,000
was merely an attempt to

567
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,960
hold up the three of you briefly

568
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,960
to avoid Ji Dafu.

569
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,400
We've been investigating a case

570
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,520
involving usury,

571
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,080
and it has led us to Ji Dafu.

572
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,640
This individual is quite discreet,

573
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,120
and to avoid alarming him,

574
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,040
we had to resort to this approach.

575
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,600
we apologize for any inconvenience caused.

576
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,160
No worries, no worries.

577
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,040
However,

578
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,680
this approach is a bit too conspicuous.

579
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,240
If there were observant individuals,

580
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,000
and they happened to notice you,

581
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
wouldn't that expose your intentions?

582
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,640
You are absolutely right, Lady Yan.

583
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,280
This time, we were indeed careless,

584
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,000
and we will be more vigilant next time.

585
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,880
If I hadn't caught a glimpse of your token,

586
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,200
I wouldn't have realized

587
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,800
that you are the Delinquent.

588
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,920
The token of the Chief Inspector!

589
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,360
No formalities, please!

590
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
You flatter me!

591
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,680
The token represents the chief's presence;

592
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,600
this is a basic principle

593
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,040
that the Delinquent are well aware of.

594
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Rest assured, Lady Yan,

595
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,160
in the future,

596
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,680
if there's anything

597
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,960
you need from us, the Delinquents,

598
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,480
we will do our utmost

599
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
without hesitation!

600
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,160
You just mentioned

601
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,120
that Ji Dafu is quite discreet.

602
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,680
Have you uncovered anything?

603
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,000
On the surface, Ji Dafu

604
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
is a tea house owner,

605
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,080
but in reality, he also operates

606
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
an underground casino

607
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,760
and engages in usury.

608
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,720
A significant amount of money

609
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,880
flows through his casino,

610
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,680
being laundered,

611
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,560
and then circulated to various places,

612
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,320
making his activities highly suspicious.

613
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Are you implying

614
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,080
that Ji Dafu

615
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,120
is likely collaborating with

616
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,560
a hidden mastermind to accumulate wealth,

617
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,880
laundering illicit funds

618
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,560
through the casino?

619
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,880
This case has extensive implications,

620
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,120
and as we follow the leads,

621
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,840
we've uncovered many

622
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
officials from the Gannan region

623
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,920
who are also entangled in this.

624
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,680
This is why we act alone, not together.

625
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,840
Are you three interested in

626
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,280
investigating the casino as well?

627
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,040
You'll need to disguise yourselves.

628
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Do you all remember your roles?

629
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,520
You are Sun Daniu.

630
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
You are...

631
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,520
Liu Qingming!

632
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,680
I'm Wan Er.

633
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,840
The three of us

634
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,880
are merchants who

635
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,320
came to Gannan for business.

636
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,760
It seems you've overlooked

637
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,800
the most crucial point.

638
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,680
What point?

639
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,400
We are heading to a gambling den,

640
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,640
and among you two,

641
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,960
who is skilled at gambling?

642
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,280
That would be me for sure.

643
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,400
I assure you

644
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,360
I'll win so much that

645
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,880
they'll even bring out the land deeds!

646
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,760
Welcome, gentlemen!

647
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,640
This way please!

648
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
Here.

649
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,480
Wan Er.

650
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,280
Once you're seated,

651
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,000
when the waiter brings the tea and snacks,

652
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,560
just make a subtle signal.

653
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,360
Gentlemen,

654
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,560
this way, please.

655
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,120
Someone will escort you to the casino.

656
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,440
I'll be undercover as a guard there,

657
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,240
ready to assist you when needed.

658
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
Place your bets!

659
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,440
Place your bets!

660
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,320
Halt!

661
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,120
You three

662
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,360
look unfamiliar.

663
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,880
Big!

664
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,840
Let's go, no dawdling!

665
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,520
These gentlemen seem a bit bored,

666
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,480
and they want to bet big.

667
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,200
Just take them inside.

668
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,400
Sure thing.

669
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,560
Understood.

670
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,800
Follow me.

671
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,520
Come on! Again!

672
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,320
Come on!

673
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,680
Keep it going, hurry!

674
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,640
Bet big or small?

675
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,720
Big!

676
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,720
Coming through.

677
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,600
Big, big!

678
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,000
No regrets once the bet is placed.

679
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,320
Place your bets and leave it!

680
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,400
I won!

681
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,040
It's all mine, all mine!

682
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,160
I won!

683
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,560
Bet big, bet big.

684
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,560
-Big, big! -Small, small!

685
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,640
Help me out here!

686
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,760
Congrats, everyone!

687
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,480
One more game!

688
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
This time, I'm betting big!

689
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,480
I'll go with big!

690
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,560
Place your bets and leave it!

691
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,040
What stakes are we playing for today?

692
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,920
Let's follow Wan Er's lead.

693
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,320
You play a few arounds;

694
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
if you win, it's yours.

695
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,680
If you lose, it's on me.

696
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,680
Sounds good.

697
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Then for the first round,

698
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,040
fifty taels.

699
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,800
Alright.

700
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,280
Big!

701
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Everyone, place your bets and leave it!

702
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,640
Big or small, place your bets and leave it!

703
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,920
Look closely,

704
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,840
fifty taels!

705
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,640
Look carefully.

706
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,760
I'll go big!

707
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,960
Everyone,

708
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,960
no regrets once the bet is placed!

709
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,720
I'm betting big!

710
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,600
I'm betting small!

711
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,640
Something is off for sure.

712
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,280
One, two, two, five points, small!

713
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,440
Congratulations to everyone!

714
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,240
Looks like your luck isn't great today.

715
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,360
Let Sun Daniu take over!

716
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,440
Today's not my day,

717
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,760
I must say.

718
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,480
Daniu,

719
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,600
you are up!

720
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,040
My stomach...

721
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
It hurts so bad.

722
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,800
What's wrong with him?

723
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
No, no,

724
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,760
I need to use the restroom!

725
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,280
But,

726
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,400
I'll wait until you

727
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,480
finish this round.

728
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,160
Our boss, Wan Er

729
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,960
doesn't want to bet small,

730
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,000
he wants to go big.

731
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,680
Exactly!

732
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,560
I'm curious how much you gentlemen

733
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,920
want to wager?

734
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,880
One thousand taels!

735
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
One round to determine the winner!

736
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,320
One thousand?

737
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,040
What, one thousand taels?

738
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
Alright!

739
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,280
With such a hefty bet,

740
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,360
how about we adjust the payout?

741
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,120
How about one to two?

742
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,680
Sure thing!

743
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
No regrets once the bet is placed.

744
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,320
One thousand taels,

745
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,480
I'm betting big!

746
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,440
-Open it! -Open it!

747
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,040
What's taking so long?

748
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,600
Hurry up!

749
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,160
Exactly!

750
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,560
Come on, open it!

751
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,800
Exactly,

752
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
what are we waiting for?

753
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,080
When I was losing earlier,

754
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,520
you were so eager to open it.

755
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,400
Now what?

756
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,640
With such a large bet,

757
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,960
shouldn't you make it quicker?

758
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,400
Exactly!

759
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,040
Open, open!

760
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,520
Let's go, let's go!

761
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,120
What are you waiting for?

762
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,720
Open it already!

763
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,520
Right!

764
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,800
Open it!

765
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Come on, let's go!

766
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,920
What's going on?

767
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,280
We've been waiting forever!

768
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I won! I won!

769
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,120
-I won! -Incredible!

770
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,880
I won! I won!

771
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,120
Me. me!

772
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,920
Gentlemen,

773
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,760
today must be your lucky day.

774
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,520
How about this,

775
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
since you are now on fire,

776
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,520
let's have another round.

777
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,080
Our boss wants

778
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,640
to meet you all personally.

779
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,960
That's it for today.

780
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,240
Tell your boss

781
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,440
that the silver we won today

782
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,280
is more than enough!

783
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,080
I've heard several

784
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,800
esteemed guests have arrived today.

785
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,400
I am Ji Dafu,

786
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,000
the owner of this establishment.

787
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,680
Whether we gamble or not doesn't matter;

788
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,200
what matters is building friendships.

789
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,400
I've prepared some fine tea in the suite.

790
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,520
I warmly invite you all to come upstairs

791
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,400
so we can enjoy tea and conversation.

792
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,520
Fine.

793
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,560
We are coming now.

794
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,720
Xing.

795
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Gentlemen,

796
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,360
it's a pleasure to meet you!

797
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
Come, come.

798
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,880
Please.

799
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,120
Please.

800
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,760
What's going on here?

801
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,560
Being so clumsy.

802
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,000
You are going to scare my guests!

803
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,680
Boss,

804
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,920
this man is no longer of any use.

805
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
What should we do with him?

806
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,640
Why keep someone useless?

807
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,400
Throw him out!

808
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,040
Understood!

809
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,640
Winning big in

810
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,920
my gambling den,

811
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,200
not weighing the length

812
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,760
of his own life...

813
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,120
It seems the tale of the masked spectre

814
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,280
eating people's limbs while they sleep

815
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,840
likely originated from the casino,

816
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,960
where victims, having lost their limbs,

817
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,080
dare not speak out

818
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,560
and instead

819
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,320
claim amnesia.

820
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,120
Apologies, gentlemen.

821
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,080
My men can be a bit clumsy,

822
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,480
and they seem to lack courtesy.

823
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,720
I trust I didn't frighten you.

824
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,000
You certainly startled me just now!

825
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,840
What happened to that man's arm?

826
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,680
How did it get broken?

827
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,920
Oh, it's nothing serious.

828
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,240
It's just that man's arm was quite fragile;

829
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,040
a slight touch,

830
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,080
and it snapped.

831
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,400
I can see that

832
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,080
you gentlemen

833
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,080
have won quite a substantial

834
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,440
amount of money in my casino.

835
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,600
That wouldn't be right. Don't you think?

836
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,680
We won it fair and square!

837
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,560
It's not like we took it by force.

838
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,920
How can that be wrong?

839
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,640
If that's the case,

840
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,799
I won't waste any more time

841
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,319
with idle chatter.

842
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,120
I'll present you with two options:

843
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,080
either

844
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,920
you play with me and

845
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,799
return the winnings,

846
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,120
or you can keep the winnings,

847
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:18,960
but you must leave behind

848
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,480
a part of yourselves.

849
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,240
Choose wisely!

850
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,080
I refuse to

851
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,000
choose either option;

852
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,120
I'll keep the silver and my body parts!

853
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,920
It seems there's nothing more to discuss.

854
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,520
Boss, there's

855
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
someone outside wants to see you.

856
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
I'm busy.

857
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,680
Send them away!

858
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,080
The governor, Lord Mo,

859
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,960
is among the visitors.

860
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,240
Keep an eye on them!

861
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,400
Stay back!

862
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,680
Lord Shen.

863
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,400
Take them away.

864
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,280
Understood!

865
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,120
Move!

866
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,440
Faster!

867
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,360
Move!

868
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,160
This is absolutely outrageous!

869
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,080
Establishing a secretive

870
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,760
gambling establishment

871
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,560
and resorting to trickery

872
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
right under my nose!

873
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,360
I only discovered while reviewing

874
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,120
the case files

875
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,800
that Ji Dafu's wife, Li Xiulian,

876
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,480
was a victim of a

877
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,000
notorious rape-murder case

878
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,720
from many years ago.

879
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,600
And this case

880
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,040
was precisely caused by her brother,

881
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,560
Li Kaixiang, who failed to repay a loan.

882
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,320
The headless corpse case was likely

883
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,960
Ji Dafu seeking revenge for his wife,

884
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,040
using the rumor of masked spectre

885
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,120
to cover up the killing of Li Kaixiang.

886
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,400
Does Ji Dafu even

887
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,760
acknowledge the existence of the law?

888
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,120
How could such a villain

889
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,400
have escaped justice?

890
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,720
Guards!

891
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,600
Everything is going far too smoothly...

892
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,640
Relay my order immediately!

893
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,120
Launch a citywide manhunt for Ji Dafu!

894
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,040
Understood!

895
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,320
Lord Shen,

896
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,240
Lady Yan,

897
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,120
Your courage

898
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,400
in venturing into danger

899
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,080
has solved this case.

900
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,800
Take your rest;

901
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,000
I will see to the rest.

902
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,960
Trust me,

903
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,800
I will certainly capture Ji Dafu

904
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
and bring him to justice!

905
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,880
The masked spectre?

906
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,480
He have slipped away.

907
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,760
Shen Du!

908
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Kill me...

909
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,000
His limbs' meridians have been severed,

910
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,320
and his face was flayed.

911
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,680
To accomplish this in such a short time,

912
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,160
he must be a seasoned criminal!

913
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,200
What's going on?

914
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,280
What happened?

915
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,160
Biqiu has lost too much blood;

916
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,920
I fear he may not survive...

917
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,920
Biqiu!

918
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,040
Hang in there!

919
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,040
What happened?

920
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,080
Masked spectre...

921
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,520
It was the masked spectre, right?

922
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,120
I will not let you go unpunished!

923
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,760
Why did you do this to my subordinate?

924
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,640
Come at me!

925
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,480
You should have come at me!

926
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,240
Lord Mo,

927
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,080
please calm down.

928
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,560
Did you see his face?

929
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,400
-Biqiu! -Plea...

930
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
What do you wish to say?

931
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,400
Please...

932
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,600
End my suffering...

933
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,960
Shen Du!

934
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,520
Shen Du!

935
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,560
Put me out of my misery...

936
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,080
Gratitude...

937
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,760
Biqiu,

938
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,320
rest assured,

939
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,800
I will treat your family

940
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,680
as if they were my own.

941
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,080
There's no need to blame yourself.

942
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,320
In this world,

943
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,680
there will always be wicked individuals.

944
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,720
I understand this reality.

945
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,120
It's just that...

946
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,280
Witnessing it firsthand

947
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,720
is still too much to bear.

948
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,200
Then let's stop watching.
