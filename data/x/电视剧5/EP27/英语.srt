Bright Time EP27

3
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,840
Babe.

4
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
Let me help you.

5
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,640
Hope the food suits your taste.

6
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,600
In case it's cold there,

7
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,440
better pack those

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,400
sweaters and jackets.

9
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,520
Mom, no worries.

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,080
It's not cold.

11
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,880
It will, at night.

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,920
It's all

13
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,560
in your head.

14
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,160
Of course I'm worried!

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,880
It's your first big trip after all.

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,080
How about

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,400
having your dad

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,240
dropping you off tomorrow?

19
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,520
C'mon, mom.

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,400
It's just a month

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
and I'm all grown up.

22
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
Nothing to worry about.

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,440
Oh, no.

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,240
Gotta pack your long johns.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,800
Mom!

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,600
You...

27
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,680
What are you doing?

28
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,600
Whoops, get caught.

29
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
Sleepwalking?

30
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
He's doubting me?

31
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,200
So scary.

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,120
Whatever.

33
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,800
I'll find it sooner or later.

34
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,200
You're not here to hang with me,

35
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,600
but to mess with me instead.

36
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
Since it's not in the study,

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,200
the next target is...

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,800
To hit the bed.

39
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
What?

40
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,360
I sleepwalked again last night?

41
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,480
You sure you're sleepwalking?

42
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,000
Or were you just messing with me?

43
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,360
Granny.

44
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Whenever I sleep

45
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
in a room that has been

46
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
idle for long,

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
I always end up sleepwalking.

48
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,520
Right, that guest room

49
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,720
hasn't been used in ages.

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,200
Gosh.

51
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,760
You're giving me the chills.

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Thankfully,

53
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,840
you didn't wander off outside,

54
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,200
that could've been

55
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,880
really dangerous.

56
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
So what now?

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,360
What if I

58
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,440
sleepwalk outside tonight?

59
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
That'd be nice.

60
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,480
Don't worry.

61
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Li'l Su.

62
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,320
Skip the guest room tonight

63
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,040
and bunk with me.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Yeah.

65
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,840
Sleep with Granny,

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,440
she'll keep an eye on you.

67
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,320
But...

68
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,160
But what?

69
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
I did a sleep test overseas.

70
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,080
The report said that I've got

71
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,840
severe sleep restlessness.

72
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,400
What's that?

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,720
It's like I get all wiggly

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,720
and punchy

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,400
when I'm

76
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,360
asleep,

77
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
so I gotta sleep solo.

78
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,120
That bad?

79
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,760
What now?

80
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
The other rooms

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,400
haven't been used

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,240
in a while too.

83
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,760
Can't put you in the living room, huh?

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,920
I have a proposal,

85
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
not sure if Jinghui will go for it.

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,520
No.

87
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,800
Well.

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,080
Mind if I crash in

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,760
your room tonight?

90
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,840
No way!

91
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm a teen boy

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,640
with secrets,

93
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,320
My room's

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,960
not an option.

95
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
And I just

96
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,520
said no.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,080
Uncle.

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,720
I guess I'll have to

99
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
sleep in the couch then.

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
You're not.

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,520
Jinghui.

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,680
She's a young lady

103
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
and a guest too.

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,240
No way she's sleeping on the couch.

105
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Swap rooms with her,

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,040
alright?

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,520
Dad!

108
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,040
Granny, help me.

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,720
Jinghui.

110
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,680
Be a good host.

111
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
Just do it.

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,200
Granny.

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,200
Even you're not backing me up?

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,280
I am.

115
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
I'll clean up that

116
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,040
guest room for you.

117
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,600
What?

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
What kind of backup is that?

119
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
Thanks. Granny.

120
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,080
Jinghui.

121
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,000
You're the best!

122
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
No! I'm not!

123
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm all messed up now.

124
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,200
Eat up.

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,720
Yeah.

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,120
Excuse me.

127
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,240
Don't touch around!

128
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,560
I know.

129
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,000
First,

130
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,080
don't touch my Legos.

131
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm not that interested.

132
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,280
Second,

133
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,360
don't touch my bed.

134
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,560
What's your problem?

135
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,400
I need a bed to sleep!

136
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,680
I...

137
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
Alright, you can use the bed.

138
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,680
But that thing,

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,960
not even a touch.

140
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,320
You got it?

141
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,400
Yeah.

142
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Out of my room.

143
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,720
Go, go.

144
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Keep that in mind.

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,560
Yes, yes.

146
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Go.

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
Bro.

148
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,400
I miss you a lot.

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
Perfect timing.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,760
What happened?

151
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,200
Granny.

152
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,760
Oh, it's Ling Dong.

153
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,320
You haven't eaten yet?

154
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,640
Not yet.

155
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
I'll whip up something for you.

156
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Nah, too much hassle.

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,960
Don't worry about it.

158
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,440
It's no biggie.

159
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,240
We're a family.

160
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Here.

161
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,840
Slippers.

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,760
Alright.

163
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,560
Okay.

164
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,040
Come.

165
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
Have a seat.

166
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,880
Why are you here?

167
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Can I borrow your telescope?

168
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,360
You do have one, right?

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,600
Telescope? For what?

170
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,160
To look at stars.

171
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,840
Stars?

172
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
According to astronomical forecasts,

173
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
a super rare thing's happening

174
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,960
This.

175
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,920
in the sky tonight till the 22nd.

176
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,120
Jupiter and Saturn are gonna

177
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
line up real close.

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,560
From the Earth...

179
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,960
Sure, you can use the telescope,

180
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,400
but with one condition.

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,400
Take me with you.

182
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,320
Seriously?

183
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,440
You're into this?

184
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,960
Special circumstances.

185
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,680
I gotta get rid of

186
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
a little monkey.

187
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,760
Who do you mean?

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,720
I think

189
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,920
I've met you before.

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,400
Hands off.

191
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,960
Go away.

192
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,960
This is?

193
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,040
She...

194
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,160
- is the little monkey... - Hi, I'm Su Xi.

195
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,880
Lan Jinghui is my cousin.

196
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,720
What's your name, boy?

197
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm...

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,520
Ling Dong.

199
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,040
Ling Dong.

200
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,800
Jinghui.

201
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,040
In person,

202
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,120
I can confidently tell you that

203
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,360
he's quite the looker.

204
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,480
Think before you speak.

205
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:30,840
Alright.

206
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,960
Where's your telescope?

207
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,200
I'll grab it.

208
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,920
Come on, I know

209
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,760
where it is.

210
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,320
Where's your telescope?

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
She knows nothing.

212
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,840
How about this.

213
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,000
We're going stargazing together,

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,920
so just bring it

215
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,760
with you then.

216
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,400
I'll see myself out.

217
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
I'll come with you.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,040
Where are you guys going?

219
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,200
Count me in.

220
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,840
None of your business.

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,480
Just stay at home.

222
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,640
Really?

223
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,360
Going for JU,

224
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,600
no RU?

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,360
Yes.

226
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,680
Finally come around.

227
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,360
Mom's the one

228
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,160
who knows how to

229
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
fix things, huh?

230
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,480
To be honest,

231
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,600
still got a lot of problems to tackle.

232
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,240
What?

233
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,120
Since your mom's agreed

234
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,040
to go with you,

235
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,560
no more

236
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,320
to worry about.

237
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,440
Don't be

238
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
a worrier.

239
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
Just focus on your goal,

240
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,160
right?

241
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,160
But if,

242
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,040
I mean...

243
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,360
if I somehow

244
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
get in JU

245
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,800
but you don't,

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,040
it's like, my flurry of wild punches

247
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,760
defeat a master like you.

248
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,160
Well.

249
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
You feelin' pretty confident, eh?

250
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,040
Yep.

251
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,080
I, Lan Jinghui,

252
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,640
will definitely make it.

253
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,680
Okay.

254
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,800
But I think

255
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,280
now you should focus on

256
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,160
handling

257
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,000
your cousin.

258
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,880
Hey, listen up.

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,000
I noticed

260
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,080
she's been

261
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,680
snooping around

262
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,040
in my room.

263
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,680
Really.

264
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360
What's up with you and that girl?

265
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,720
She's

266
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,680
at my games every day,

267
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,000
don't you see?

268
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I'm over it already.

269
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,560
Her mom's

270
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
that writer, right?

271
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,560
And she's my teacher too.

272
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,160
Think the girl's gonna

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,880
show up

274
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
to your game today?

275
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
I bet she won't.

276
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,800
I bet she will.

277
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,120
No doubt about it.

278
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,840
One text from me,

279
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,520
and she's there.

280
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,640
Stop bragging.

281
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not.

282
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,480
She doesn't come,

283
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,480
you'll be looking silly.

284
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,560
Alright.

285
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Enough about this.

286
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,320
Let's make a deal,

287
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,400
loser buys dinner.

288
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,960
You've always been my easy win.

289
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,840
Ma'am, I'm done.

290
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,240
Finished.

291
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,240
Bye.

292
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,040
Ma'am, I'm done.

293
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,880
- I'm done. - Me too.

294
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
Bye.

295
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,440
Bye.

296
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,880
Mengyu.

297
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,800
Thought you'd be

298
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,320
too busy studying.

299
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,960
Nah.

300
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,400
Needed a break.

301
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,360
After this game,

302
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,480
let's grab something tasty.

303
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,080
Okay.

304
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,720
Yeah. Be right back.

305
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,080
Come.

306
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
Ma Yiming, what's wrong with you?

307
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,880
Keep your distance from that guy,

308
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,560
okay?

309
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:41,960
Who?

310
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,000
Ma Mao.

311
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,520
You know

312
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,640
he's bad news, right?

313
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,160
You think you know him?

314
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,200
We've known

315
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,560
each other for ages.

316
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,640
I know him

317
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
better than you.

318
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
I'm serious,

319
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,480
don't want you to get hurt.

320
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
Mind your own

321
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,760
business.

322
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,320
Who do you

323
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,200
think you are?

324
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Hello everyone.

325
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
According to the forecast,

326
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
there'll be a very rare

327
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,600
astronomical event

328
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,120
of Jupiter and Saturn conjunction

329
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,720
on the 22nd.

330
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
The angular distance between them

331
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,800
will reach 6.19 minutes arc.

332
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,360
From the perspective of the earth,

333
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,560
Jupiter and Saturn

334
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,680
will be extremely close.

335
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
Experts said that

336
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,760
the best time to observe

337
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,560
in China is one hour after dark

338
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,840
on the evening of the 21st.

339
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,160
Why are you dressed

340
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
like a star?

341
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,400
Not really.

342
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,240
Used to be Captain Chenjun.

343
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,280
Why'd you

344
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,840
drag me here?

345
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,920
I had to sneak out

346
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
by pretending

347
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,240
to buy books.

348
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,200
You have no idea,

349
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,960
my cousin's eyes

350
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,760
are on me

351
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,320
like a hawk.

352
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,840
Perhaps it's just

353
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,400
a misunderstanding.

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,760
No way.

355
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,120
Got any proof that

356
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,920
she's up to something?

357
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,000
This is the proof.

358
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,760
It's

359
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,440
a pencil lead?

360
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,200
Of course.

361
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,280
Are you serious?

362
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
Sorry, I broke it.

363
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,200
But this is so silly.

364
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,480
Bring it to the bookstore?

365
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,440
But that thing over there,

366
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,560
not even a touch.

367
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,160
You got it?

368
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,320
Yeah.

369
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Out of my room.

370
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,000
Go, go.

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,960
Where is it...

372
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm heading down to grab a bite.

373
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,160
Don't touch it.

374
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,120
You hear me?

375
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,040
You said your cousin

376
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,680
lives abroad all year round,

377
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,680
and you haven't seen her in years,

378
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,520
so what could she possibly be up to?

379
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,120
Yeah.

380
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,920
It's the creepy part.

381
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,240
You know

382
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,200
something's

383
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
not right with her,

384
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,920
but you can't say what.

385
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,520
This whole situation

386
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,760
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

387
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,560
But

388
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,760
there's nothing I can do.

389
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,240
Please.

390
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
She likes chatting

391
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,000
with you,

392
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
so just keep her talking

393
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,560
and see if you can

394
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,280
find out what she's up to.

395
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,560
I won't do it.

396
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,760
You gotta help me out with this, bro.

397
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,280
What's in it for me?

398
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,280
My dear uncle.

399
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,720
My desk mate.

400
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,880
My good bro.

401
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
If you help me with this,

402
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,480
I'll finish every exercise

403
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,440
whatever it takes.

404
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,920
Stop.

405
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,120
No way, even if you

406
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,720
call me Dad.

407
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,200
Grandpa.

408
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
What was that?

409
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
Grandpa.

410
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,640
Don't push your luck.

411
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,960
Alright,

412
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,920
come back.

413
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,480
You mad?

414
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
Already?

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,680
I'll do it, okay?

416
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,960
I'll give it a try,

417
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
all right?

418
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,240
Huh?

419
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
Say something.

420
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,560
I said yes.

421
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,520
Look at you.

422
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,040
Take it off.

423
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,960
Pretty handsome.

424
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,640
Right?

425
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,240
Say something.

426
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
I said I'll do it.

427
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,720
Handsome?

428
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,280
Yeah.

429
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
Charming.

430
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Like, ever.

431
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,680
Ling Dong.

432
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,640
Here.

433
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,240
I got you their

434
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,360
famous bubble tea.

435
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,520
Thanks.

436
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,240
How is it?

437
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,160
Yummy!

438
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,440
You return to China annually?

439
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,240
Not really.

440
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,280
I love hitting the road.

441
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,840
Just got back from Atacama.

442
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
I know Atacama

443
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
has incredibly clear skies

444
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
and it's recognized worldwide

445
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,920
as the best place for stargazing.

446
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,200
I'd love to go there someday.

447
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,120
Let's do Atacama next.

448
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,440
I got you covered.

449
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Yeah, sure.

450
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,720
The little monkey's

451
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,840
two-faced.

452
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,880
Don't trip on her tricks.

453
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
Let us do Atacama next.

454
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,320
Ling Dong.

455
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,920
You're smart,

456
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,720
and good-looking,

457
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,080
perfect in every way.

458
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
How'd you end up

459
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
being buds with my cousin?

460
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,840
Your cousin's

461
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
got a few issues.

462
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,440
Moody,

463
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,280
bad grades,

464
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,000
doesn't play by the rules,

465
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,800
and can be rude.

466
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,240
Plus, he can be

467
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,480
a bit goofy.

468
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,720
Yeah. Goofy.

469
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Besides me,

470
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,320
hardly anyone's his friend.

471
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,800
As his only buddy,

472
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,720
you must know him very well.

473
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,760
I'd say I know him inside out.

474
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,720
Let me ask you.

475
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,720
Where does he hide

476
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,360
his goodies?

477
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Goodies?

478
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,720
You mean?

479
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,680
Like

480
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,520
his ID, bank cards?

481
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,520
- Ah, those... - You know?

482
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,320
I don't.

483
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,720
Why are you asking about this?

484
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,920
Just...

485
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,600
trying to

486
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,160
get to know him better.

487
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
This is so delicious,

488
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm gonna grab another one

489
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,120
to take home for my grandma.

490
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,320
Almost spilled the beans.

491
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,400
Two

492
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,200
bubble teas, please.

493
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,120
Alright, coming up.

494
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,720
Must be distracted by his looks.

495
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,320
Your cousin's weird,

496
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
she asked about your IDs

497
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,080
and bank cards.

498
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,040
Oh, no.

499
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,640
She's got all my passwords,

500
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,880
she's clearly in it for the dough.

501
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,160
She's your cousin, come on.

502
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,240
What's the plan?

503
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,400
Keep an eye on her.

504
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,440
Well.

505
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,200
This facial mask's pretty good.

506
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,080
You scared me.

507
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,320
Of course.

508
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,840
It's pretty pricey.

509
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,560
Why're you using

510
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,440
my mask during the day?

511
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,280
You're using one too.

512
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,240
Seeing this guy

513
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,600
reminds me of a movie

514
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,080
where the thief tried to steal

515
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,320
from the lead guy

516
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,920
by searching

517
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,760
his bedroom

518
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,960
and study.

519
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,720
Like, who keeps

520
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,400
their valuables

521
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,680
in the bedroom or study?

522
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,720
Not the study? Then where?

523
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,720
A safe?

524
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,560
No way.

525
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,960
That's like

526
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,280
telling the thief,

527
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
"Come and get it!"

528
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,680
Where would you put them?

529
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,520
I'd...

530
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,120
Where?

531
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,840
I ain't got nothing

532
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,720
worth stealing.

533
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,960
My sneakers are the most

534
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,200
expensive thing I got,

535
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,640
but they're

536
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,000
so smelly,

537
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,120
who'd want them?

538
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,080
You gotta be more careful.

539
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,000
You can't just

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,160
leave them lying around,

541
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,160
like wallets, ID card,

542
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,480
band cards,

543
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,800
and... passports.

544
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Replacing them is

545
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,840
a nightmare.

546
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,080
My valuables are all

547
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,800
securely tucked away

548
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,400
in the storage room.

549
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Safe and sound.

550
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,520
I've been tired lately.

551
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,120
My skin's dry.

552
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm gonna wash up.

553
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,360
Enjoy your TV.

554
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
Huidora's box?

555
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,840
Why's he storing

556
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,960
smelly socks in the drawer?

557
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,640
He's hiding something?

558
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,360
So stinky!

559
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
I've heard of Pandora's Box,

560
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,400
but what's this Huidora's box?

561
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
It's locked.

562
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,880
It should be inside.

563
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
Where's the key?

564
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,440
Why does he have so many keys?

565
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,920
Whatcha searching for?

566
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
Passport.

567
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,640
Hi, Jinghui.

568
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,520
You're back already?

569
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,960
Look there!

570
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,400
So you knew everything.

571
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,600
Your acting sucks,

572
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,960
I saw through it

573
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,800
in one glance.

574
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm gonna tell granny

575
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,280
you tricked and bullied me.

576
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,760
Nope,

577
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
not buying it.

578
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,680
Hold it in.

579
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
Spill it,

580
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,800
why do you want my passport?

581
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,360
You're not getting

582
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,440
anything out of me after that.

583
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,160
You sure?

584
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,640
Help, help, help!

585
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,800
0.01 mm shorter.

586
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,560
Let go of my lipstick!

587
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm gonna get you for this!

588
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,560
0.01, 0.01...

589
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Oh, 1.0 mm's gone.

590
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
I'll never

591
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,800
submit to darkness.

592
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,160
Fine.

593
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,920
Spill it, or not?

594
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,400
Good.

595
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,520
I give up.

596
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,600
Please tell me

597
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
the truth.

598
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
I'll buy you anything

599
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,520
you want.

600
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,720
Skins for games, clothes,

601
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,160
skincare, luxury items.

602
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,720
You name it!

603
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,680
Tell me the truth!

604
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,320
Okay. Wait and see.

605
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,520
Don't push me

606
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,480
to my last resort.

607
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,960
I don't have a weak spot.

608
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,480
Everyone,

609
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,800
let's see some magic happen.

610
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,880
Enough?

611
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,080
Enough?

612
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,680
Enough?

613
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,160
Enough.

614
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,240
Enough!

615
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,720
Out!

616
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,720
Now!

617
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,040
Get out!

618
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,040
Alright, alright.

619
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,720
What?

620
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,600
That's enough.

621
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,520
It won't bother you.

622
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,720
I gotta pee.

623
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
Get out before I count to three.

624
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,480
One, two, three!

625
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
I gotta pee, you hear it?
