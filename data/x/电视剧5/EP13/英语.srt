00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,120
Bright Time EP13

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,760
May I come in?

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,480
Yes.

5
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,080
Mr. Zhang,

6
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,240
regarding our basketball team members,

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,080
if they failed three subjects,

8
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
they're not allowed to play.

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
I'd like to ask for one more chance

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,280
for them.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,640
Please, sir,

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
give us one more chance.

13
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,120
Why should I?

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,920
It's the same for the entire grade.

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
Why do you have to be so special?

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I can vouch for them.

17
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,000
Ling Dong, let me remind you,

18
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,160
I don't think you should

19
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,600
get involved in this.

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,080
Sir,

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,960
as Lan Jinghui's uncle

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,040
and also

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,160
the leader of his study group,

24
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,760
I should be responsible for his

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,200
academic performance.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,560
So I guarantee

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,320
that by the time of the finals,

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,720
Lan Jinghui can advance

29
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
by 100 places.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please give him a shot.

31
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,960
100? Are you nuts?

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,680
I have that confidence in you.

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,680
Right, 100.

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,680
Do you realize

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,640
how many people a single point

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,480
can surpass in our school?

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,240
With your current grades,

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,560
it's almost an

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,600
impossible task.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,040
Sir,

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,520
just give me a shot.

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,960
I can definitely pull this off.

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,280
Ling Dong, can he do it?

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,520
Absolutely.

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,920
It seems like in your basketball team,

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,120
besides Lan Jinghui,

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,520
some others

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,400
don't meet the requirements, right?

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
That goes for the others too.

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,400
Fine.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,760
I'd love to see what you've got.

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,720
Lan Jinghui,

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
just show me your best shot.

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,040
Go back to the classroom.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,280
Thank you, sir.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,480
Ling Dong.

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
Pigeons secrete milk to feed their young,

58
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,160
and chicks learns from the hen

59
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,400
scratching the ground for worms to eat.

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,320
Which one

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,800
is directly related to pituitary function?

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,040
Pigeons feeding the young is due to

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,760
the pituitary secretion of prolactin,

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,960
while chicks are just learning.

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,320
Got it.

66
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
Ling Dong, what about this one?

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,640
Can chlorine gas produce

68
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
sulfur monochloride?

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Yes.

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,160
It can directly combine

71
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,600
with most non-metallic elements,

72
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
including sulfur.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,920
It can produce sulfur chloride,

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,240
and sulfur dichloride

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,280
when chlorine is in excess.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,280
Cool.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,600
Ling Dong, today's physics class on

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,240
universal gravitation,

79
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
I didn't quite understand.

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
That's simple!

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,480
I got it.

82
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,800
There is an attraction

83
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
between two objects.

84
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
And it exists

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,720
among all

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
in the universe.

87
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,040
This is called universal gravitation.

88
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,680
Ling Dong, is that right?

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,760
Mostly correct.

90
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
For such simple questions,

91
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
no need to bother him.

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
Just come to me.

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,840
Isn't that Lan Jinghui?

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,280
All in here, huh?

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,640
Did you all fail the midterm?

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,520
You're all screwed, aren't you?

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,720
You can't even pass your midterm.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,640
How are you gonna compete with us

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,440
in the tournament?

100
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,880
Shouldn't you strive for

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
for comprehensive development,

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,560
huh?

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,360
Peng, we didn't pass either.

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,680
Ling Dong,

105
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,800
could you help me

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
with this?

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,640
Which one?

108
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,840
Here, the first one.

109
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,520
That's it for today's lesson.

110
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
I've covered a lot of stuff.

111
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
Make sure that you take time

112
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,440
to review it.

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,440
Class dismissed.

114
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,320
Stand up.

115
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,040
Goodbye, sir.

116
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,720
Mr. Guo,

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,240
I have some other stuff

118
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,840
going on recently.

119
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,200
So, I don't have time

120
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,120
for the competition class.

121
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,960
Has your class advisor been informed?

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
Yes, she has.

123
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
OK, then.

124
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
I'll give you the learning materials

125
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,760
for your absence.

126
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,360
Just study on your own.

127
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,600
Come to me when needed.

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
Thank you, sir.

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,240
Ling Dong.

130
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
I need to have a conversation with you.

131
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,360
Why do you...

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,040
You can't fool me...

133
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
I know what's going on.

134
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,280
I'm aware why you dropped out.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,800
I just want you

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
to tell me the reason in person.

137
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
Mr. President, I don't need

138
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
to report everything to you, right?

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't call me that.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,200
Since you hang out with

141
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,560
students like Lan Jinghui,

142
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,160
you don't take me,

143
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,280
the president of the student union,

144
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,480
seriously.

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
He is gonna drag you down,

146
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,240
do you know that?

147
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
It seems to

148
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,880
have nothing to do with you.

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,280
You're definitely wrong!

150
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,720
Listen,

151
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,240
in the entire grade,

152
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
only you and I,

153
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
the two of us,

154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,920
can become real

155
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,280
academic rivals.

156
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,080
If you choose

157
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,960
to ruin your future,

158
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
then you're welcome to do so.

159
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,040
How about this,

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,360
let's make a bet.

161
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,720
On what?

162
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,200
At the end of this term,

163
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,160
I'll make Lan Jinghui

164
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,000
advance by 100 places.

165
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,920
And you just need to advance by 1.

166
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,400
You're so full of yourself.

167
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,800
Seriously, Ling Dong.

168
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,440
Who does he think he is?

169
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,840
C'mon!

170
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,040
Lower yourself, don't rush it.

171
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,920
Take a breath before you shoot.

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,040
Alright!

173
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,280
You got it!

174
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,480
Come on.

175
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,400
All objects are subject

176
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,840
to an unchanging force,

177
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,760
and the direction of initial velocity

178
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,400
is not in a straight line

179
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
with this force,

180
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
then the object's trajectory

181
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,800
is a parabola.

182
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,840
Jinghui, what's he talking about?

183
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,360
Beats me.

184
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,080
Parabola?

185
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,760
In the air, the basketball

186
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,840
is only affected by gravity,

187
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,040
with its size and direction unchanged,

188
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
and the direction of initial velocity

189
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
is not collinear with gravity.

190
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,680
Then the basketball's

191
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,960
trajectory in the air

192
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,360
is a parabola.

193
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,760
Once you understand the principle,

194
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,320
your shooting percentage will increase.

195
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,880
Dude,

196
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,320
I didn't expect

197
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
you are this good.

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,480
This represents the essence verified

199
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
by countless predecessors.

200
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,320
If we apply it to

201
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,040
the basketball game,

202
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
it will be very helpful

203
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,920
in improving shooting.

204
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
It could do just that?

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
You've got to explain it to me,

206
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,200
about that

207
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,840
parabola principle.

208
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,760
In the math class this afternoon,

209
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
we'll learn quadratic functions,

210
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,840
which will cover

211
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,840
this.

212
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
You'd better pay attention to that.

213
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,600
Sure, sure.

214
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,280
Listen to me,

215
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,960
since you have

216
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,040
such a solid base of

217
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,160
knowledge and expertise,

218
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,360
how about

219
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,800
you become our

220
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,600
assistant coach?

221
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,160
Your knowledge, and my skills...

222
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,360
Let's join forces.

223
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
We'll be invincible, right?

224
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,640
- Yes! - Exactly.

225
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,520
Hey, you...

226
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,400
don't just go.

227
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,440
Can you give me a straight answer?

228
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,760
Assistant coach?

229
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,800
Because I'm the head coach.

230
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
Wait...

231
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,960
alright...

232
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,280
you'll be

233
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,960
the head coach.

234
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,680
And we all listen to you,

235
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,720
okay?

236
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,160
It depends on your effort.

237
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,800
Hey, you want to see my effort,

238
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
then why are you leaving?

239
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,560
Wait,

240
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,480
at least teach a couple

241
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,160
of moves.

242
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
You're the head coach,

243
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,520
correct?

244
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:45,960
Come on...

245
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,760
Slow down.

246
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Where are you going?

247
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,480
This is your first day being a head coach.

248
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,200
You can't just abandon your post.

249
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,400
Hey, just stay.

250
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Let's take a look

251
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,440
at this equation.

252
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
Y^2 = 2P.

253
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
I've drawn a diagram for you.

254
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,760
There is a point F

255
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,840
and a line L.

256
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,120
The points that are equidistant from them

257
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,240
are called the parabola.

258
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,960
So the fixed point F

259
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
is called the focus of the parabola.

260
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,280
Lan Jinghui,

261
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,560
do you have any questions?

262
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,680
No.

263
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,320
I think you've

264
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
made it quite clear.

265
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,360
As if I've opened the door

266
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,280
to a new world.

267
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,760
Good, sit down. Let's continue.

268
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,040
Guys,

269
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,200
I've already written down

270
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
the formula of

271
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,640
the equation for the focus.

272
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,840
You can take a good look

273
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,720
and take notes.

274
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,280
Review everything you've learned

275
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
today.

276
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
You should read it through,

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,840
and then...

278
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,200
This type of problem...

279
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,600
Guys,

280
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,720
look at this one.

281
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,480
For an electron to transition from

282
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,920
the ground state to an excited state,

283
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
it requires 9eV of energy.

284
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,200
What wavelength

285
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,080
of light is needed for this transition?

286
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,720
Can anyone

287
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,280
come up and solve this?

288
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,760
Sir, my name is Ling Dong.

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Ling Dong,

290
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,280
do you mind waking Lan Jinghui up?

291
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,800
The teacher is calling.

292
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,240
Lan Jinghui,

293
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,080
come up and work on this one.

294
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
What? You don't know how to do it?

295
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,440
"ε = hv"

296
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
can be used

297
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,160
to calculate the energy

298
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,400
required for an electron

299
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,920
to be excited by light from the

300
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,080
ground state to the excited state.

301
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,040
ε = hv?

302
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,760
Right.

303
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,000
Even Lan Jinghui knows how to do it.

304
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,120
Unbelievable.

305
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,520
C'mon,

306
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,600
I can't even do it myself.

307
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,760
Lan Jinghui got the answer right.

308
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
Return to your seat.

309
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,520
Light is a form of electromagnetic waves

310
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,480
which consist

311
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,040
of energy quanta.

312
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,560
Each quantum

313
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,120
carries an energy

314
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,040
of Hv,

315
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,880
which is Planck's hypothesis.

316
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,480
"V" stands for frequency,

317
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,760
and "H"...

318
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,920
Is anyone interested in

319
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,880
the cheerleading squad?

320
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,320
Just come to us for signup.

321
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,320
Xiao Xiaohua is gonna lead?

322
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Can she handle it?

323
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,760
She even won an award

324
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,760
at the talent competition.

325
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
There's no doubt she can do this.

326
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,760
That was all thanks to Ling Dong.

327
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,480
Me! Count me in!

328
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,200
Me too!

329
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,400
Wait, I'm coming!

330
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
Qingtian, I want to...

331
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,720
Nah, you're a boy.

332
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,800
Hey, guys...

333
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,120
Count me in then.

334
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,880
We didn't ask you...

335
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,760
I'm just anxious to ensure

336
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
everything goes well...

337
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,080
I hate to see our class get embarrassed.

338
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,600
Shu is a ballerina.

339
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,480
She's got a great figure.

340
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,760
But I'm not so good at choreography.

341
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,440
What should we do?

342
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,400
Wait, I've got someone in mind.

343
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,280
She'll do fine.

344
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,160
Mengyu,

345
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,120
I knew I'd find you here.

346
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,200
I don't know why,

347
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,760
but lately,

348
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,160
I just like to hang out in here.

349
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,360
What's up?

350
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,960
The basketball tournament

351
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,280
is coming soon.

352
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,640
I'd like to invite you to join

353
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,760
our cheerleading squad.

354
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,360
Why me?

355
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,000
Do you really trust me

356
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,080
to lead the team?

357
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,600
You know,

358
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,120
besides being a lousy singer

359
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm also uncoordinated.

360
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,720
What if we get laughed at

361
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,760
by other squads?

362
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
Do you really need me?

363
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,440
This isn't what I know about you.

364
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,000
You used to be so decisive.

365
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,440
Alright, I'm in.

366
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,920
But let's get one thing straight.

367
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,920
You all

368
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,000
have to listen to me.

369
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
The music, costumes, and dance

370
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
should be carefully designed.

371
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,840
OK, it's a deal.

372
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,760
Deal.

373
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,840
Up, down,

374
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,280
exactly,

375
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,080
5, 2, 3, 4,

376
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,440
5, 6, 7, 8,

377
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
6, 2, 3, 4...

378
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,880
Alright, look at this one.

379
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,360
Given that A is greater than 0,

380
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,320
B is less than 0,

381
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,600
and A is not equal to B...

382
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,640
You are so sweet!

383
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,640
Go on, pass them!

384
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,320
Go ahead.

385
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,040
This one is for you.

386
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,080
Thanks.

387
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,760
Hey, Qingtian...

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,680
Jia Letian.

389
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,760
Nope...

390
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,400
I don't know.

391
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:28,960
Alright,

392
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
I'll explain it again.

393
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,400
2, 2, 3, 4...

394
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,280
Xiaohua, you're

395
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
uncoordinated.

396
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,920
Shift your weight back.

397
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,480
6, 7, 8,

398
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,320
2, 2, 3, 4,

399
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,240
5, 6, 7...

400
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,000
Mr. Zhao!

401
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,400
- Ms. Fang? - You got a minute?

402
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,320
Sure.

403
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,040
Here's the thing.

404
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Could you do me a favour?

405
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Not a big deal.

406
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,520
No worries. What is it?

407
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,440
Be my guest.

408
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,080
The basketball

409
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,040
tournament is coming up soon.

410
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,160
If it's convenient for you,

411
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,400
could you

412
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,840
possibly give some coaching

413
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,520
to Class 5?

414
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,560
Oh, about that...

415
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,960
Is there a problem?

416
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,080
Ms. Fang,

417
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
this raises an issue

418
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,040
of fairness.

419
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,640
If I only help

420
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,000
Class 5,

421
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
it wouldn't be fair, would it?

422
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:50,960
That's true.

423
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,120
Alright then, thanks anyway.

424
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,640
Take care.

425
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,560
Ms. Fang,

426
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,560
let me think about it.

427
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,920
5, 6, 7, 8...

428
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,640
1, 2, 3, 4,

429
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,560
5, 6, 7, 8.

430
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,120
2, 2, 3, 4,

431
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
5, 6, 7, 8.

432
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
3, 2, 3, 4,

433
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,200
5, 6, 7, 8.

434
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,840
4, 2, 3, 4,

435
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,240
5, 6, 7, 8,

436
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,240
5, 2...

437
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,280
Are you done?

438
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Beat it if you're done.

439
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
We need the court.

440
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,160
Hey, Jokester,

441
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,560
take them with you and leave.

442
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,160
No!

443
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,720
What did you say?

444
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,160
It was clearly that we got here first.

445
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,640
My name is Xiao Xiaohua.

446
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,400
Keep that in mind.

447
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,360
You've been using it for so long.

448
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,240
It's our turn now.

449
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,080
Exactly.

450
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,480
This place is pretty big.

451
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
Can't you girls practice over there?

452
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,000
Why should we?

453
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,720
You've been using it for so long!

454
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
We just got here!

455
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,080
You outnumber us, so what?

456
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,200
Even though it's been so long,

457
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,400
you haven't got any better.

458
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,480
Why hog the court?

459
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,680
It's our turn!

460
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,040
If you can't do it right, just quit!

461
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,520
Bullying the few is unfair!

462
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,200
Get lost!

463
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,920
What's going on here?

464
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,520
They've been hogging the court

465
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,000
the whole time.

466
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,280
What do you mean hogging?

467
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,720
It's our turn!

468
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,400
Ask them to leave!

469
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,600
Why should we leave?

470
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,800
Right.

471
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,160
This isn't the private court

472
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,120
of Class 8.

473
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,160
Say that again!

474
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,600
So what?

475
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
Can you all shut up?

476
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
I told you to leave!

477
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,040
Jinghui.

478
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,400
Lan Jinghui?

479
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,160
Jinghui.

480
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,840
Apologize!

481
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,960
Come again?

482
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:20,960
Apologize

483
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,360
to our girls now!

484
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,640
What if I say no?

485
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,720
Lan Jinghui,

486
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,160
I've put up with you for long.

487
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Looking for an ass kicking?

488
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,040
Right?

489
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
Come on!

490
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,120
Want a piece of me?

491
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,800
Stop, stop!

492
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,320
You guys, stop!

493
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,360
Are you going to fight?

494
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,000
What's going on?

495
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,440
Calm down!

496
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,240
Ms. Chai,

497
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,760
class 5 has been monopolizing the court.

498
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,320
We need to practise as well.

499
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,760
What? Monopolizing?

500
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,000
It's a public place.

501
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,920
Alright, stop!

502
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,400
Which class

503
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,680
was using the court just now?

504
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,680
Class 5.

505
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,280
Ms. Chai,

506
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,560
we were using it,

507
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,960
but...

508
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,800
Well,

509
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,480
you've practised

510
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
here already,

511
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
it's only fair that the next slot

512
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,320
goes to

513
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,040
other classes.

514
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,440
But we haven't finished!

515
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,640
C'mon,

516
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,960
chill out!

517
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,200
Just take turns, OK?

518
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,520
Class 8, come on.

519
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
Beat it!

520
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,080
Despicable!

521
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,200
Class 5, take a short break.

522
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,400
Class 8, get on with your training.

523
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,280
Hurry.

524
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,600
Don't let this upset you.

525
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,520
Just focus on your practice.

526
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,560
Why did you stop me just now?

527
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,320
Class 8 was

528
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,400
being unreasonable.

529
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,760
Exactly.

530
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,680
That Bi Peng is the worst.

531
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Despicable.

532
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,560
Hitting girls?

533
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,000
If Ms. Chai hadn't shown up,

534
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,920
I'd have kicked his butt already.

535
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,160
C'mon,

536
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
do you wanna get expelled all together?

537
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,120
Just

538
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,800
try the best

539
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,080
to win the match.

540
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Ling Dong is right.

541
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,160
We should be aiming to

542
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
beat Class 8 on the court,

543
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,160
then parade the trophy

544
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,280
around their classroom.

545
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,360
Xiao Xiaohua,

546
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,600
how come

547
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,680
you sound different?

548
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,920
Do I?

549
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,240
Let's focus on

550
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,440
how we're gonna beat Class 8.

551
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,560
It's easy to say.

552
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,560
They're among the favorites to win.

553
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,480
Don't boost their morale

554
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,440
and undermine our own.

555
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,520
We should recognize our improvement.

556
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,000
Cheer up!

557
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,480
Jinghui is right.

558
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,880
I should be the one holding

559
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,560
the championship trophy

560
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,520
and slapping their faces with it!

561
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,680
Let's see how Ms. Chai

562
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,960
react to that!

563
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,160
Let's go.

564
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,600
Let's go.

565
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,760
Nice shot!

566
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,240
Nice!

567
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,960
What's happening?

568
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,760
Watch your defense.

569
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,520
Can't stop him.

570
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,280
So impressive.

571
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,480
Ms. Fang,

572
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,960
what's all this?

573
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,800
The tournament

574
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,880
is coming up.

575
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,160
I prepared these items

576
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,960
for our cheerleading squad.

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,840
I think

578
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,240
all this preparation is unnecessary.

579
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,920
It distracts the kids

580
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,080
and affects their studies.

581
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,360
I firmly believe

582
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,920
that they should

583
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,840
strike a good balance

584
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
between learning

585
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,320
and entertainment.

586
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,520
What a young idea!

587
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,880
My students are

588
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,720
extremely self-disciplined.

589
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,320
I don't have to worry about them at all.

590
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,160
They're always focused,

591
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,320
such as on the cheerleading

592
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,560
and winning games.

593
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,080
What fancy boys and girls!

594
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,160
I trust them completely.

595
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,760
In my opinion,

596
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,040
Lan Jinghui,

597
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,960
the troublemaker

598
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,560
shouldn't lead the team at all.

599
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,320
How can such an unreliable boy

600
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
take the lead

601
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,680
and manage a team?

602
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,800
Bravo!

603
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,640
Ms. Fang,

604
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm talking to you.

605
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,040
Why do you keep zoning out?

606
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,440
Oh,

607
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,880
Ms. Chai,

608
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,080
I was just wondering

609
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,160
what was the reason

610
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,040
behind your statement?

611
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,440
I didn't mean ill.

612
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,480
I know,

613
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,320
I don't have your experience,

614
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,800
and I'm still young.

615
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,800
But I have a

616
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,680
different perspective.

617
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,160
Actually,

618
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,640
I don't think

619
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,680
Lan Jinghui is a troublemaker.

620
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,600
Certainly, I don't believe

621
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,040
him being the team leader is a joke.

622
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,360
After all, you don't know him.

623
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,240
What reason do you have

624
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,920
to definitively say he's not fit for it?

625
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,440
Well...

626
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,360
This rain is getting heavier.

627
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm going back inside.

628
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,160
Go! Lan Jinghui!

629
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,640
Come on!

630
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,680
Go, Class 5!

631
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,400
Class 5 will win!

632
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,400
Class 5 will win!

633
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,280
Class 5 will win!

634
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,200
Overall, Class 1

635
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,880
is mediocre,

636
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,800
but they've got a few tall guys

637
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,320
who are tough to defend,

638
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,160
especially their center.

639
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,880
You need to press him.

640
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,960
Ma Yiming, Jian Zhiqiang,

641
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,000
you two will need to work closely.

642
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,680
Be sure to minimize contact

643
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,360
with the ball.

644
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,960
Keep him away from the penalty area.

645
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,680
Xu Chao,

646
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,840
you will be the key for the game.

647
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,400
Everyone, just relax.

648
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,520
They're not as formidable as they seem.

649
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,680
Just play like we do

650
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,160
in practice.

651
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,240
Don't worry.

652
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
We're never scared in the first place.

653
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,840
We've got "Captain Chenjun" here.

654
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,280
Alright, good luck!

655
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,920
Class 5, go for it!

656
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,600
Come on!

657
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,360
Come on!

658
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,040
3, 2, 1,

659
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
Class 5, victory!

660
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,720
Go, go!

661
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,960
Go, Class 5!

662
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,200
Go, Class 5!

663
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,920
Go, Class 5!

664
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
Go, Class 5!

665
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,200
Jinghui, here!

666
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,560
Go!

667
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,920
Get back on defense, Ma Yiming!

668
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,240
That's a foul!

669
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,960
That's a legal charge.

670
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,560
Go, go!

671
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,880
Class 1, go!

672
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:31,920
Do it!

673
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
It's been three minutes,

674
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,600
we haven't scored yet.

675
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,920
Both classes

676
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,280
have a strong desire to win.

677
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,720
If this keeps up,

678
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,360
they'll burn out soon.

679
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,080
Go!

680
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,200
Go for it!

681
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,680
With Ling Dong's shooting tips,

682
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,480
our accuracy

683
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
will improve greatly.

684
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,000
X equals 2PX,

685
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,000
P is greater than 0.

686
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,160
F0 is one-half P.

687
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,400
Y equals negative one-half P.

688
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,000
Give it another shot.

689
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,960
Head coach!

690
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,960
Who's the head coach?

691
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,600
The head coach...

692
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,120
Lan Jinghui...

693
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,320
Yeah, Lan Jinghui.

694
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,720
Coach.

695
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,040
Don't leave.

696
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,320
Help us!
