1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,080
Bright Time EP19

3
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,040
Chen Luyang, hand these out.

4
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,600
Okay.

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,080
I've only got

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,040
17 copies.

7
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,160
So, two students share one,

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,680
okay?

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,080
Alright, now,

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,120
let's start with this question.

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't know

12
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,880
when or

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,000
why they're at odds.

14
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Guys can be really weird sometimes.

15
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,560
But I know

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,920
they'll patch things up eventually.

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,000
The question is,

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,240
when and how

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,000
will it happen?

20
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,880
So light on salt.

21
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,280
Ling Dong?

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,920
Ling Dong.

23
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,600
Ling Dong.

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,920
Attention!

25
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,120
We're gonna do

26
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,080
the 800-meter run for girls,

27
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,040
1,000-meter run for boys,

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,120
long jump, and sit-ups.

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,640
What?

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,560
Stop the whining.

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,080
I have to remind you that

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,920
the school is really strict

33
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,520
about this fitness test.

34
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,840
Lan Jinghui.

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You lead

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,480
the training.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,280
Got it.

39
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,360
You guys can help each other

40
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,360
if you can.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
Ling Dong, team up with Lan Jinghui.

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,800
Go do your warm-ups.

43
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,280
Go for it!

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,480
Come on.

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,600
Good.

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,440
Chen Luyang, speed up.

47
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,800
Come on, Xiaohua!

48
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,880
Time's up.

49
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,920
You're free to go.

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,560
I attended a meeting

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,280
days ago,

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
and a major issue was raised.

53
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
A lot of seniors aren't

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,120
passing their fitness tests.

55
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,400
If they don't improve,

56
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,040
their sports grades in the college exam

57
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,880
will be bad.

58
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,280
So our principal

59
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,120
requires

60
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,600
all students of Grade 11

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
to undergo field training

62
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,280
this weekend.

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,120
It's mandatory.

64
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,360
Take a look at this chart,

65
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,400
very few have excelled,

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,480
and 30% have failed.

67
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
Okay, I got it.

68
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,760
Hey guys.

69
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,160
Listen up.

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,440
We're all going on

71
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
a training trip.

72
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
No one's skipping.

73
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,880
Alright, stop.

74
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
This trip

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
is primarily

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,480
a training exercise

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,120
to improve our physical fitness.

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
It's scheduled for this weekend.

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,440
Anyone not down for it?

80
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,400
Hands up?

81
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,320
No one?

82
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,760
Nope.

83
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,560
Cool, everyone's in then.

84
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,120
Class begins.

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay, guys.

86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,400
When you get on the bus,

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,920
find a seat and chill out,

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,840
no messing around,

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,360
got it?

90
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,200
Okay.

91
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,960
Take care.

92
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Attention!

93
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,920
For this training trip,

94
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,400
the school has assigned

95
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,720
a drillmaster to each class

96
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,480
to lead your training.

97
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,000
This means

98
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,080
the entire activity

99
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,360
will be conducted strictly

100
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,920
under semi-military management.

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,720
This is Mr Wu,

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,600
who will be in charge of Class 5.

103
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,360
Let's give him a warm welcome.

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,520
Good morning!

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Good morning, sir.

106
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
Welcome to our training camp.

107
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,200
I know

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,800
at home, you might have

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,200
some prince or princess syndrome,

110
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,880
but here,

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,760
you gotta

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,520
put all those

113
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
bad habits away.

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,360
During the training,

115
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,640
no mobile phones,

116
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,240
tablets, snacks,

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
or any other entertainment devices

118
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,400
are allowed.

119
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Give them up now.

120
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,560
Goodbye, my chicken feet,

121
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
beef jerky, instant noodles,

122
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,400
and potato chips. I'll miss you all.

123
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,160
Now.

124
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,760
Students who are ready,

125
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
follow Mr Wu

126
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,520
to the dorms.

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,840
We'll have night watches,

128
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,720
so stay put

129
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
and listen to orders.

130
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Do not

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,040
leave the camp without permission,

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,040
okay?

133
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Yes, sir!

134
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:16,880
Let's go.

135
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,680
Follow me.

136
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,560
I'll take this bed.

137
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,560
I want the upper bunk.

138
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,160
Mind if I sit?

139
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,000
This bed's pretty hard.

140
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,600
Listen up.

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
Let's start with

142
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,240
the three-legged race.

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,040
Now,

144
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,520
quick and easy.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,440
First row,

146
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,200
you, 1, 3, 5, 7,

147
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
step up two.

148
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,320
Back row guys, move up

149
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,560
and mix it up

150
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,040
by height,

151
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
let's see some variety.

152
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,560
Now.

153
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,840
Relax, Mengyu.

154
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
I got muscles,

155
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
if you lag behind,

156
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,560
I'll just piggyback you.

157
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,960
Alright, teams are set.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Just don't hold me back.

159
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
Lend a hand and tie up the

160
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
girls' legs to boys' with those strips.

161
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,720
Hurry!

162
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,680
Yes, sir!

163
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,320
Shall we get the leg-tying done?

164
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
The race

165
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,640
is all about

166
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,200
teamwork.

167
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,400
Stay safe.

168
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,280
And keep an eye

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,800
on your members'

170
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
speed and rhythm.

171
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,800
Understood?

172
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Yes.

173
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Louder!

174
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,160
Yes!

175
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,840
Practice on your own.

176
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,880
Take it easy,

177
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
follow the rhythm.

178
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
One, two. One, two.

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,680
Here.

180
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,280
Left, right.

181
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,840
Left.

182
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,760
Watch out.

183
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,720
You alright?

184
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,640
I'm fine.

185
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,440
You okay?

186
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

187
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,200
One, two, three, go.

188
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
One, two.

189
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Wait, wait, wait.

190
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,440
Slow down.

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,040
Why are you

192
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
syncing with him?

193
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,560
I asked you

194
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,640
to stick to my beat.

195
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,440
Xiaohua.

196
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,520
Tell Lan Jinghui,

197
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
he's going too fast.

198
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,080
Ling Dong says you're going too fast.

199
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Tell Ling Dong,

200
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,880
he's the one

201
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
going too slow.

202
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,240
Lan Jinghui says

203
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,360
you're going too slow.

204
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,360
Tell him.

205
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
It's a group thing.

206
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,040
He needs to

207
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,800
think about the team.

208
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,080
Ling Dong says

209
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,560
it's a group thing.

210
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,800
You gotta think about the team.

211
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,600
Tell him...

212
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,120
Enough!

213
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,240
What's going on with you two?

214
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,160
Ask him.

215
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,920
What the heck is he up to?

216
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,520
Ask him.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Has he been treating me right?

218
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,640
What? Ask him.

219
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,440
What does he mean?

220
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
What nerve,

221
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,800
asking me to explain?

222
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,680
Ask him

223
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
to clarify his mess!

224
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,200
Xiaohua.

225
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,920
This is really pointless.

226
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,600
Tell him to cut

227
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,240
to the chase.

228
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,120
I won't say it,

229
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,280
let him confess himself.

230
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm no

231
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
criminal to Lan Jinghui,

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,400
what confess?

233
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,760
What...

234
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,480
Stop it!

235
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,840
How about a quick breather

236
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,240
before we get back to it?

237
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll beat Ling Dong this time.

238
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,480
Keep going.

239
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,960
Left, right.

240
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,240
Left, right.

241
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
Chen Luyang, you're too fast.

242
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,400
We can't keep up.

243
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,280
Moving this slow,

244
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
we won't win first place.

245
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,000
Try again.

246
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,360
Go.

247
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,720
Left, right.

248
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,680
Left, right, left...

249
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,120
Qingtian, you alright?

250
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,040
It hurts.

251
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,120
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,680
My bad.

253
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,240
I rushed it, my mistake.

254
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,640
You really gunning for that top spot?

255
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,160
Always being runner-up

256
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
makes me wanna be No. 1, badly.

257
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,000
Alright.

258
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560
I'll try again.

259
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm no study buddy,

260
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
but maybe this time I can

261
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,640
get you that top spot.

262
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,200
Hold out your hand.

263
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,240
Why?

264
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,600
Why are you giving me lollipop?

265
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,240
Gotta put some ointment on,

266
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,400
it'll sting a sec.

267
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,400
Just open it.

268
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,280
Sorry.

269
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:28,920
I...

270
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,480
I'll do it gently.

271
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,720
Am I doing right?

272
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,080
Left, right, left.

273
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,560
You alright?

274
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,360
Yeah.

275
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,240
Let's take a break.

276
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,560
Left, right.

277
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,000
Left, right.

278
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,400
Left, right.

279
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,720
Left, right.

280
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,600
Ms Fang.

281
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,760
Hi, Mr Wu.

282
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,200
Feeling under the weather?

283
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,080
Not really.

284
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,120
My shoulders ache from sitting too long.

285
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,560
Shoulders?

286
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,600
Let me give you a massage,

287
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,560
got some good kneading skills.

288
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,360
Nah, thanks.

289
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,120
I'll do it myself. It's okay.

290
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,440
It's fine.

291
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,680
Well, thank you.

292
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,840
Come on, it's a pleasure.

293
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,600
Feeling better?

294
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah, it's working.

295
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,640
You bet.

296
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,800
We've got a whole session

297
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,000
on rehab

298
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,160
in the Special Ops.

299
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:38,960
Oh, really?

300
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,200
You take classes for rehab?

301
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

302
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,400
Also gotta strike a balance

303
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,400
between work and rest.

304
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,080
Here, here.

305
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,640
Here?

306
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,000
Right.

307
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,920
You made it.

308
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,720
Your muscles are really tight.

309
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Um...

310
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,200
too many lessons, you know.

311
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,120
Excuse me.

312
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,920
Mr Wu.

313
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,160
The students

314
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,360
have practiced enough,

315
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,640
let's give 'em a breather?

316
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,120
It's time.

317
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,920
Gather up!

318
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,120
Training's done.

319
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,680
Well done, everyone!

320
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,200
Dismissed.

321
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,400
Ms Fang, you worked hard too.

322
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,160
Nah, you did.

323
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,000
Mr Wu.

324
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,720
You must be starving,

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,640
grab

326
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,080
some dinner?

327
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,200
Wanna join me?

328
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,080
- Nah. - Sure.

329
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,680
Mr Zhao, you ain't going?

330
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,560
Well, Mr Wu.

331
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,200
Let's go then.

332
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,640
Let's go.

333
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah.

334
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,760
Bye, Mr Zhao.

335
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,960
Can you teach me

336
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,440
some kneading skills later?

337
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,200
No problem.

338
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,280
You're all up?

339
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,800
Here you are.

340
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,360
Here.

341
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,520
Take one.

342
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,800
Here.

343
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,800
Candle?

344
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,640
Get down here.

345
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,960
What's up?

346
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,120
All right,

347
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,360
you guys just skip the candles.

348
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,200
Hey, listen up.

349
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,400
Something crazy

350
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,520
happened at

351
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
my aunt's village.

352
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,680
It's true.

353
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
A guy cheated on his wife,

354
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,080
dumped her.

355
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,240
And she

356
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,320
jumped to her death.

357
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Then

358
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,920
weird stuff started happening.

359
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,400
The guy kept seeing

360
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
his ex-wife's ghost

361
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,200
flitting

362
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,160
around

363
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,600
his bedroom

364
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,480
wall.

365
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
He's freaked,

366
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,360
so he goes to a guru.

367
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,360
The guru told him

368
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,080
that hiding...

369
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,440
under the bed

370
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,200
can protect him.

371
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,360
Just as predicted,

372
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,680
it happened again.

373
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,720
One night,

374
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,200
the man was asleep

375
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,440
when he heard

376
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,320
thumping noises on the roof.

377
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,960
He believed that

378
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,880
this must be his ex-wife.

379
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,760
He quickly blew out the candle

380
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
and hid under the bed.

381
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,200
Thump, thump, thump...

382
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
Suddenly, an upside-down face

383
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,720
appeared

384
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,200
before him,

385
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,280
whispering softly

386
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,040
in his ear,

387
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,680
"I finally found you!"

388
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,760
It scared him out of his wits.

389
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,160
Jinghui, are you okay?

390
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm off to the night shift.

391
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,120
You're so timid, Jinghui.

392
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,080
So annoying.

393
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
You really scared me.

394
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,080
Really scared me.

395
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,960
Are you okay?

396
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,400
Why did you come out too?

397
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,840
What?

398
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,560
You have to watch me outside school?

399
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,360
I'm your uncle,

400
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,880
of course I need to care for you.

401
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,040
What if you weren't?

402
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,280
What do you mean?

403
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,400
I mean, if we

404
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,320
had no relation at all,

405
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,360
would you still force me to study,

406
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,120
care about me,

407
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,440
and be nice to me?

408
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,000
I wouldn't want to, honestly.

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
Who would want such a big nephew?

410
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,240
That's not what I'm asking.

411
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,880
Then what?

412
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,200
Don't you know what I'm saying?

413
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,760
I...

414
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,040
Lan Jinghui,

415
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,320
do you know?

416
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
I've been waiting for you

417
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,440
to say that for days!

418
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,680
I really don't know

419
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,520
what you're talking about.

420
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,640
Come on, make it clear.

421
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,520
What's gotten into you these days?

422
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,760
What's

423
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
wrong with you?

424
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,520
What did I do wrong?

425
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm just trying to

426
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,480
help you improve your grades,

427
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,480
so you can stay

428
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,640
and prove yourself

429
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,760
to your dad. How is that wrong?

430
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,360
Yeah, right.

431
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,360
You just want to prove it to my dad.

432
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,840
What?

433
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,600
Tell me,

434
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
did my dad

435
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,720
give you the scholarship?

436
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,760
So, you think

437
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm only caring for you

438
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,080
'cause I got the scholarship?

439
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,640
No.

440
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,320
Then you...

441
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,200
Well,

442
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,360
you...

443
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
tell me,

444
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,680
did you take it

445
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,400
or not?

446
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,600
I did.

447
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,160
You did?

448
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,840
Then why are you so arrogant?

449
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,040
Why are you

450
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
so confident?

451
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,040
Why can't I?

452
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,760
I earned it with my own abilities.

453
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,960
I earned it with my own

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,520
grades.

455
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
Why can't I be confident?

456
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,200
But you did take it,

457
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
and that makes

458
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,400
your intentions impure.

459
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,000
What do you think my intentions are?

460
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,200
I thought...

461
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
you genuinely

462
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,440
considered me a friend,

463
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,240
so I...

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,360
treated you with

465
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,800
my heart.

466
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,320
But now it sounds like

467
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,920
my dad

468
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,720
gave you a task.

469
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
What you're doing is like writing

470
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,280
a named composition

471
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,760
instead of original writing.

472
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,000
Do you know

473
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,280
why did I participate in the talent show?

474
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,640
Why?

475
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,200
Because

476
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,600
you gave me a quiz question

477
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,080
and I answered it.

478
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,960
At most...

479
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,600
it was a fair exchange.

480
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,160
Okay, what about the locker room?

481
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,680
Why was I

482
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,960
on time to the room

483
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,600
and even testified for you?

484
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,080
Fine,

485
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
that only proved you're

486
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,600
a kind guy.

487
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,400
That's true.

488
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,440
Even so,

489
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:11,960
why would I

490
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,040
join the basketball game?

491
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,240
Maybe...

492
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,160
you wanted to show off.

493
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,320
Yes,

494
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,080
I wanted to show off.

495
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
You're right.

496
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,240
I have nothing else to say.

497
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,640
No, no.

498
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,160
It's not like that.

499
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,000
No, I...

500
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,960
Just give me a moment.

501
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,880
Calm down for now.

502
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,760
Just listen to me.

503
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,880
I just...

504
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,000
wanted to discuss it

505
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,640
with you today.

506
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,120
I'm not

507
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,200
looking for any answers.

508
00:22:59,640 --> 00:22:59,960
Besides,

509
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
aren't you

510
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,920
too temperamental?

511
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,560
Getting angry so soddenly.

512
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,840
I just wanted to

513
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
talk this through with you.

514
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,240
I...

515
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,760
You...

516
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,200
Don't come over.

517
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
Ma Yiming, go stand guard.

518
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,840
What, jumping into the lake?

519
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,600
Just exercising.

520
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,760
Jinghui, to be honest,

521
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Ling Dong really treats you well.

522
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,520
Why don't you just apologize?

523
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,160
You think I'm wrong too?

524
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,800
Of course.

525
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,080
No,

526
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,320
you don't even know

527
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,800
the whole story,

528
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,880
but you think I'm wrong?

529
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,160
Look at you, all guilty

530
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,280
and sheepish.

531
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,120
I don't even need to know it

532
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,200
to know you're wrong.

533
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,320
I'm telling you, Jinghui,

534
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,320
Ling Dong is really nice.

535
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,960
Look,

536
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
he helped you in the talent show,

537
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,840
and the basketball game too.

538
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,800
Just think about it with your heart.

539
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,520
That's your stomach.

540
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,600
Your heart is here.

541
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,440
Eyes may not

542
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,160
be able to see the truth clearly,

543
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,440
but the heart can.

544
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,800
C'mon.

545
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,120
You're here just for a training.

546
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,720
Why suddenly

547
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,960
philosophical standing by a lake?

548
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,400
I am the son of the lake.

549
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,080
Ma Yiming.

550
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm passive.

551
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:03,880
Come on,

552
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,120
move over a bit,

553
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,920
give me some space.

554
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,080
Ling Dong,

555
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,080
does this height work?

556
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,040
Is it okay?

557
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,120
Is there any gap?

558
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,400
What's going on?

559
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,680
Just put in a good word for me.

560
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,000
Shall we start?

561
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,080
Sure, let's start.

562
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,600
Not yet, wait a moment.

563
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,200
Okay.

564
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,080
Let's go.

565
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,280
You call the shots.

566
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,600
Me?

567
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,360
You call the shots.

568
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,600
One for this side,

569
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,600
and two for that side.

570
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,080
No problem.

571
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,720
Come on.

572
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,440
One.

573
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,320
One.

574
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,720
Two.

575
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,800
Slow down.

576
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,200
Let me adjust it.

577
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,000
My bad.

578
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm sorry.

579
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,440
How about this?

580
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,520
Ling Dong,

581
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
how about you call the shots?

582
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,040
We'll follow your rhythm.

583
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,720
What do you think?

584
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,200
Xiaohua,

585
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,440
I'm calling it.

586
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,120
Okay.

587
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,920
Ready?

588
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,200
One, two.

589
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,560
One, two.

590
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,920
Slow down.

591
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,760
Lan Jinghui, what's wrong with you?

592
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,360
Can you do it or not?

593
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,120
I...

594
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,560
I was really...

595
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,200
It's okay.

596
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,720
I quit.

597
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,160
Oh, no!

598
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
Don't!

599
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,160
Don't.

600
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,320
Please.

601
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,440
I'm begging you.

602
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
How about this?

603
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,520
Let's stop for now.

604
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,640
We all stop.

605
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,840
When you want to practice,

606
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,400
we'll continue.

607
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,800
We need to rest, right?

608
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,160
And it's so hot now.

609
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,440
Xiaohua,

610
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,880
I think the two of us

611
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,920
can practice it first.

612
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,960
No, no.

613
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,800
Listen to me,

614
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
we're practicing

615
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,640
the three-legged race,

616
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,240
so,

617
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,640
about this...

618
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,200
- Move. - Let me help you.

619
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,040
Alright,

620
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,200
I'll move.

621
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,400
No problem.

622
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:50,880
Ready?

623
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,440
We can go.

624
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
No, I...

625
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,560
Wait a second.

626
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,520
I just got here.

627
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm not ready yet.

628
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,080
Just give me five seconds.

629
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,520
Are you ready now?

630
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,320
Wait, wait,

631
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,760
wait a sec.

632
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,560
It's okay.

633
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,400
Okay.

634
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,640
Ready?

635
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,280
One.

636
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,040
One.

637
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,840
Two.

638
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,440
Two.

639
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,440
Good.

640
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,520
Two.

641
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,200
Yes, one, two.

642
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,320
One, two.

643
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,120
People really can't make mistakes.

644
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,120
Those who do are so pitiful,

645
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,240
humble and miserable.

646
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,600
Suffering and feeling

647
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,680
so unsettled.

648
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,560
Who can feel my pain?

649
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,120
What do you want?

650
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,160
I...

651
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,160
I just want

652
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,080
drumsticks.

653
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,960
Just that?

654
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,560
Yeah.

655
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,360
Is it enough?

656
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,960
Yes.

657
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,320
What a coincidence!

658
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,400
You're hungry too?

659
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,480
Hungry at the same time, huh?

660
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,240
What are you eating?

661
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
No drumsticks?

662
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,320
I happen to have some extra.

663
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,920
Here's one for you.

664
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,360
No, thanks.

665
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,520
Come on, you have to eat.

666
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
You're the backbone

667
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,360
of our team, right?

668
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,320
You need to replenish

669
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,360
with some quality protein.

670
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,360
Lan Jinghui,

671
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,600
are you bothering me all day

672
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
just to find out the answer?

673
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,280
Alright, I'll tell you now.

674
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,640
Don't.

675
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,040
I'll tell you now.

676
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,680
No need!

677
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,600
I'm serious, you don't have to.

678
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,560
I'm sure that

679
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,080
you have your own

680
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,520
reasons.

681
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,080
Given our relationship,

682
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,560
a few clumsy words can't

683
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,280
stir trouble between us.

684
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,000
Impossible!

685
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,560
Do you think I got close to you

686
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,240
just for the scholarship?

687
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,640
No, definitely not.

688
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,880
Listen to me,

689
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,880
I think you...

690
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,520
You must be...

691
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,280
What kind of person do you think I am?

692
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,960
What kind of person do you think you are?

693
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,600
Then what kind of person are you?

694
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,400
What kind of person do you think I am?

695
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,720
A bit dull.

696
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,680
Yes, exactly!

697
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,000
My grandma always says

698
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,360
the same thing.

699
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,280
Not dull,

700
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,080
more like silly.

701
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,320
Yes, silly.

702
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,640
Pretty much.

703
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Silly boy.

704
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,560
Ask them, they always say that.

705
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,680
Silly isn't quite right.

706
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
I think it should be

707
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,640
heartless.

708
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,200
Well,

709
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,080
I...

710
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,080
I'm heartless, dull

711
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,200
and silly.

712
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,440
Whatever you say.

713
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:30,880
Is that okay?

714
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,040
Speaking so quietly?

715
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,960
No.

716
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
This is your sincerity?

717
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,360
I am sincere.

718
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,760
Then, say it louder!

719
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,200
I...

720
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,040
Repeat what

721
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,840
you just said.

722
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,280
C'mon,

723
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,160
you know...

724
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,720
Back down?

725
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,160
No.

726
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
You dare not say it?

727
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,480
Well, help yourself.

728
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,200
Bye.

729
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,400
Gosh.

730
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,680
It's too hard.

731
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,080
It's too hard.

732
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,800
Ling Dong is too hard

733
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,040
to deal with.
