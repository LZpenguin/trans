00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,120
Bright Time EP04

3
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,400
You mean someone did it on purpose?

4
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,000
Exactly.

5
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,520
Who?

6
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,320
I don't know.

7
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,640
You have one day

8
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,800
to find the person.

9
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
If failed,

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,760
all of your commendations

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,040
and extracurricular activities

12
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
for your class would be canceled.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Cancel?

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,640
I don't know.

15
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,600
Mr. Zhang.

16
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,320
We'll talk about you later.

17
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,880
What if

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,640
I succeed?

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Are you qualified to talk to me?

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,280
I...

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,920
You only have

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,560
23 hours

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
and 55 minutes left now.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm leaving.

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Wait a minute.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
It has something to do with you, too.

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,600
Write a self-criticism.

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,760
I am no longer your student.

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,640
Please.

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,440
Hurry up.

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,080
Fuddy-duddy.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,960
Have you heard?

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,440
Director Zhang will

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
cancel our commendations.

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,840
What shall we do?

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,840
Everything was fine when Lu Yao

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
and I left yesterday.

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,920
Maybe someone did it

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,880
by accident?

40
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,760
Who left last yesterday?

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,280
You should be the last person.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,240
Lan Jinghui.

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,640
You mean I did it?

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,600
It shouldn't be you.

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Then, should be

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,440
Xiao Xiaohua.

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
Do what?

48
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,720
You just frame others

49
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,640
without evidence.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,760
We didn't.

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
No evidence can prove

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,800
it's not her.

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,280
And she was the last

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,240
to leave yesterday.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,880
That doesn't prove

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,800
she did it.

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,720
That makes sense.

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,920
Qingtian.

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,520
Don't argue with them.

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,840
C'mon, what's the matter with you?

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,280
What's the problem?

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,080
Enough.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,800
Stop arguing.

64
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,160
Go back to your seats.

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,960
Class begins.

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't be angry.

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,120
Go back.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,160
Well. Class begins.

69
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,840
Stand up.

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Hello, teacher.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
Please sit down.

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,400
Let's learn

73
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,840
a poem by Su Shi today.

74
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,440
Don't take it to heart.

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,720
We all know that you didn't do it

76
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
and who you are.

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,920
But I am so sad.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,160
It is true that I was the last to leave.

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,840
If I had left later

80
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
and cleaned

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
the classroom more carefully,

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,080
it would not have happened.

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,880
But now I'm implicating Ms. Fang.

84
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,520
Xiaohua, you always

85
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
don't take credit,

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,080
but

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
blame yourself.

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,080
Is it an accident

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,800
or man-made?

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,280
I don't know.

91
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,680
But now

92
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,120
some people doubt Lan Jinghui.

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,880
I think

94
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
it's not impossible.

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
After all, he transferred here.

96
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Sorry.

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
To convict me?

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
You and Xiao Xiaohua were the last.

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,640
But it can't be

101
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,200
her.

102
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,160
So, I'm the man who broke the flowerpot

103
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,440
and the rack, right?

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,560
But

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,680
they shouldn't

106
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,040
doubt you so much.

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,920
Because there is a doubt.

108
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,040
Something changed?

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,560
If you did it,

110
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,880
you wouldn't

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,640
have thrown

112
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,200
your cactus.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,400
Sure.

114
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,880
Another possibility exists.

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,560
You don't want

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
to be found out.

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,680
So you

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,040
threw it down on purpose.

119
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,480
Ling Dong.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,280
Are we enemies?

121
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
You just don't like me, do you?

122
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,280
Whatever I do, you will do me wrong.

123
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,800
Right?

124
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,680
Take it easy.

125
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,720
I know it's not you.

126
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
In fact, from the beginning,

127
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,440
I believed it was not you.

128
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,400
Why do you believe me?

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,040
Because you're not so smart.

130
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,000
Now that you are,

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,200
tell me,

132
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:41,920
who did it?

133
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,920
Look.

134
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,160
This place

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,240
is obviously deeper

136
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,960
than others.

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,080
I suspect it might have been

138
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,640
hit by something.

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,440
If so,

140
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,920
there should be traces

141
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
on it.

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
What if it's not hard?

143
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,480
Not something like

144
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,040
a stone or a hammer.

145
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,000
Not a hard object?

146
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,840
Not a hard object?

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,480
If not...

148
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,400
I see.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,720
What?

150
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,400
You don't know,

151
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,080
do you?

152
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320
You really don't know.

153
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,640
Well, I'm telling you.

154
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,840
Basketball bag!

155
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,200
I met a man with a bag

156
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,280
when I went downstairs yesterday.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,200
He may be on the basketball team.

158
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
But I didn't see exactly

159
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,120
what he looked like.

160
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,000
It was a basketball.

161
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,600
Shut up. That's my line.

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,360
It was a basketball.

163
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
I know who did it.

164
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,400
Lan Jinghui, where are you going?

165
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Bye. Bi Peng.

166
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,920
Bye.

167
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,320
Bye.

168
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
No. It's broken.

169
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,720
Just leave it open.

170
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,240
Why is it always broken?

171
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
I don't know.

172
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,720
Bi Peng, did you do it?

173
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,520
What are you talking about?

174
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,960
You smashed the flower rack

175
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,400
of my class?

176
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,320
Yeah.

177
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,120
Now you come with me

178
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,560
to Mr. Zhang

179
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,040
to make it clear.

180
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Because of it,

181
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,160
he...

182
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
What if I did it?

183
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,440
Can you prove it?

184
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,000
You...

185
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,720
I happened to see

186
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,360
the "Best Ball in the World"

187
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,680
when I passed.

188
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,600
What do you mean, Lan Jinghui?

189
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,760
Are you laughing at me?

190
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,120
I did it on purpose.

191
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,160
But

192
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,240
the rack was not stable at all.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,480
It's not my fault.

194
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
So who's to blame?

195
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,520
You, of course.

196
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,840
Because you pissed me off.

197
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
I don't mean it.

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
But now that it has happened,

199
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,560
it can teach you a lesson.

200
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,440
And

201
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,120
it's no use

202
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,600
knowing that I did it.

203
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,920
You have no proof.

204
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,800
Stop.

205
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,640
I'm telling you,

206
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,960
this is between us,

207
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
not my class.

208
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,800
Why?

209
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,560
It's all your fault

210
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,520
that your class

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,480
ended up like this.

212
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,840
Are you crazy?

213
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,960
Let's fight

214
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,600
one on one.

215
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,840
Don't mess with my class.

216
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
Well.

217
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,360
I am not afraid of you.

218
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,560
But first,

219
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
solve

220
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,760
your trouble.

221
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,280
I know you're just afraid of me.

222
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,920
Bi Peng! Bi Peng!

223
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,600
Bi Peng!

224
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
Everyone, turn the Chinese book

225
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,560
to page 23.

226
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,240
Well.

227
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,920
Today,

228
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
you'll learn a poem

229
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,320
created

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
in the Song Dynasty.

231
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,400
I believe

232
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,400
those who have read it

233
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
in advance

234
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
know that its author

235
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,720
is the famous

236
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
poetess Li Qingzhao.

237
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,920
Her works are mostly

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,640
subtle and concise,

239
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,880
different from others.

240
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,920
This has made her

241
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,960
so well-known.

242
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,080
The one

243
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,840
you're

244
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,760
about to learn

245
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,480
was completed

246
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,240
in a

247
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
specific context.

248
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,000
What do you mean, Lan Jinghui?

249
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,080
Are you laughing at me?

250
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,400
I did it on purpose.

251
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,440
No. It's broken.

252
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,360
Just leave it open.

253
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
I'll take you

254
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
to a good place later.

255
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,080
Where?

256
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,920
Just come with me.

257
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,520
Lan Jinghui!

258
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,000
Lan Jinghui?

259
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,400
Hello?

260
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,760
Lan Jinghui. Are you in there?

261
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,840
Is anyone here?

262
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Lan Jinghui. Are you in there?

263
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
Lan Jinghui!

264
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,040
Lan Jinghui.

265
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,000
Lan Jinghui.

266
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Can you hear me?

267
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,640
Lan Jinghui.

268
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
Wake up.

269
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,440
Lan Jinghui.

270
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,640
C'mon.

271
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Lan Jinghui.

272
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,800
Lan Jinghui.

273
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:08,920
Lan Jinghui.

274
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,880
Wake up.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,360
Lan Jinghui.

276
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,000
You sprayed me with water?

277
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,360
Make it clear, okay?

278
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,560
I saved your life.

279
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,960
Give me a hand.

280
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,680
C'mon.

281
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,640
Gosh.

282
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,280
You okay?

283
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,320
I don't like being touched.

284
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,840
But you just

285
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,760
carried me.

286
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,200
I made a mistake.

287
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,920
I should have dragged you out.

288
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,160
Why were you

289
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,360
in the gym just now?

290
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,640
Why did you faint?

291
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,200
I asked you first.

292
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,160
You can answer first.

293
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,600
I...

294
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,160
No comments.

295
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,160
Well, me too.

296
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,880
Um...

297
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,280
I'll tell you.

298
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,440
I'll...

299
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,600
tell you everything.

300
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm afraid of darkness,

301
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,960
and afraid of

302
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,840
being locked in a dark room.

303
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:14,880
OK?

304
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,840
Are you satisfied?

305
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,040
I saw Bi Peng.

306
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,200
He's so mean.

307
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,040
Extremely!

308
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,280
He smashed the flower rack

309
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,240
of my class.

310
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,600
I'll tell Mr. Zhang

311
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,480
about it tomorrow.

312
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,240
Do you have any proof?

313
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,640
I...

314
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,080
I...

315
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,440
I...

316
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,240
No one will believe you.

317
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,400
What about you?

318
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,320
No.

319
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,840
Come on.

320
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,480
What the hell

321
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,840
are you

322
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,080
thinking?

323
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Ling Dong. You idiot.

324
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,080
Sprayed me with so much water.

325
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,560
Don't you think I might catch a cold?

326
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,720
Don't say anything

327
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,960
about today.

328
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,760
It is up to you, my nephew.

329
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,600
I already told you,

330
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,320
don't call me that.

331
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,400
It's the last day.

332
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
But I have no idea

333
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
how to explain to Mr. Zhang?

334
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,560
In my opinion,

335
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,040
the culprit of it

336
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,440
is Lan Jinghui.

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,520
It was his fault

338
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,240
to put the heavy flowerpot

339
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200
on the rack.

340
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,840
Even so,

341
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,560
we can't blame him for it.

342
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,640
Luyang,

343
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,320
it's you

344
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,280
who decided to put it outside.

345
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,000
But...

346
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,280
'cause...

347
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,720
Lan Jinghui led me

348
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,040
to do it.

349
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,960
You shouldn't say that.

350
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,560
We're talking about the person

351
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,840
who broke the rack.

352
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,600
It had nothing to do with him.

353
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,720
We just can't find

354
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,960
that person right now.

355
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,200
It was Lan Jinghui's fault anyway.

356
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,200
Yes, he might have done it.

357
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,680
He's very naughty.

358
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,360
Jinghui, where're you going?

359
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
Maybe it was he who dropped

360
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,280
the pot.

361
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,120
But...

362
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,200
For what?

363
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,200
He must have done it.

364
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,680
He's the last one to leave last time.

365
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,800
I think it was Lan Jinghui.

366
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,960
Yes, it must be him.

367
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,160
No one else could have done it.

368
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,520
I agree with you.

369
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,960
Right.

370
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,480
Get out of the way!

371
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,360
You should get back to your seats!

372
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Mr. Zhang.

373
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,680
Did something bad happen?

374
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,320
No.

375
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,720
I know who

376
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,680
broke the flower rack.

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,240
Who is it?

378
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,280
Bi Peng from Class 8.

379
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,160
Then call him over.

380
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,840
No.

381
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,120
It's no use

382
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,000
talking with him.

383
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,240
Because he won't admit it.

384
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,000
That means

385
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,880
you have no proof.

386
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,640
Then you're smearing him.

387
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,280
Do you understand?

388
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,080
I...

389
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
I have no proof.

390
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,360
But it doesn't matter.

391
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,880
You can assume it's me.

392
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,440
I smashed the flower rack.

393
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
But it has nothing to do

394
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,240
with my teacher and classmates.

395
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,000
What do you mean?

396
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,760
Nothing.

397
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,360
If you need proof,

398
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,200
I'm the proof.

399
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,720
I can prove that

400
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,440
I did it.

401
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
So it wasn't an accident.

402
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,240
I did it

403
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,480
on purpose.

404
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,000
Are you satisfied with it?

405
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,720
So now you have no right

406
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,720
to blame Ms. Fang

407
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
or to cancel

408
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,000
all the activities

409
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,920
for my class.

410
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,200
You can expel me.

411
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll face the consequence.

412
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,720
Lan Jinghui.

413
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,880
Do you think I'll

414
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,600
believe everything you say?

415
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,360
No heroics

416
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,520
in school!

417
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,360
Have you finished speaking?

418
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,480
All right.

419
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,600
Then let me say something.

420
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,560
I told Mr. Zhang that

421
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,640
I smashed the flowerpot

422
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,880
and the rack.

423
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,160
But it wasn't you!

424
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,480
Why did you say that to him?

425
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,600
What do you mean?

426
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,160
Why did you do that?

427
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,640
Nothing.

428
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
I just don't like

429
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,800
this school

430
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,680
as well as this class.

431
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,080
So I smashed them

432
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,000
in a fit of anger.

433
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,080
And now

434
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,200
I've had fun

435
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,120
and get tired.

436
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,240
So I'm leaving.

437
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
Say something!

438
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,040
Lan Jinghui just likes

439
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
to play pranks,

440
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,080
but I believe that

441
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,440
he didn't do it.

442
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:54,920
You...

443
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,720
Say something!

444
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Jinghui,

445
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,280
seeing Ms. Fang

446
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,040
being criticized,

447
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,760
I was so worried

448
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,560
that I said something bad.

449
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,960
Jinghui, don't go.

450
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,400
Lan Jinghui.

451
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,040
You may have

452
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,160
taken the lead on it,

453
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,320
but I'm also responsible.

454
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's go explain it

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,880
to the teacher.

456
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,640
Jinghui.

457
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,680
Lan Jinghui.

458
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,280
Please don't go.

459
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,960
Jinghui.

460
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,040
Don't go!

461
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,080
What are you doing?

462
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,120
Lan Jinghui, what happened?

463
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,560
Mr. Zhang, I want to tell you...

464
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,360
What?

465
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:51,880
Sit down first.

466
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,040
Sit down.

467
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,520
Now!

468
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,200
Come on.

469
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,800
Ms. Fang has

470
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,920
something to tell you.

471
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,320
From today on,

472
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,640
all the activities of our class

473
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,200
will be...

474
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,000
What if I did it?

475
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,480
Can you prove it?

476
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,600
You...

477
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,320
I happened to see

478
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,840
the "Best Ball in the World"

479
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,280
when I passed.

480
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,440
What do you mean, Lan Jinghui?

481
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,080
Are you laughing at me?

482
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,280
It's no use

483
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,960
knowing that I did it.

484
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,200
You have no proof.

485
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,240
What if I did it?

486
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,720
Can you prove it?

487
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,840
You...

488
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,120
I happened to see

489
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,680
the "Best Ball in the World"

490
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,040
when I passed.

491
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,800
What do you mean, Lan Jinghui?

492
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,920
Are you laughing at me?

493
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,320
It's no use

494
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,840
knowing that I did it.

495
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,120
You have no proof.

496
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,800
What if I did it?

497
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,240
Can you prove it?

498
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,360
You...

499
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,120
I happened to see

500
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,560
the "Best Ball in the World"

501
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,080
when I passed.

502
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
Attention please.

503
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
This is an announcement.

504
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,840
Bi Peng of Class 8, Grade 2

505
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,720
seriously violated regulations.

506
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,600
He'll be reprimanded at school

507
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,920
and given a warning.

508
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,440
Lan Jinghui,

509
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,320
you're also responsible

510
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,680
for this matter.

511
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Go run around the playground 10 times.

512
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,800
Jinghui!

513
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,520
Cheer up!

514
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,200
Lan Jinghui!

515
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,480
Come on!

516
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,160
Come on, master!

517
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Hold on!

518
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,360
Do it!

519
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,960
Jinghui.

520
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,840
Go!

521
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,040
Cheer up!

522
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,240
Come on!

523
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,080
Go for it!

524
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,360
Come on!

525
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,840
Cheer up!

526
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,680
Lan Jinghui, do it!

527
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,840
Come on!

528
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,920
Come on!

529
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,240
You're so slow!

530
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
10 times!

531
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,960
You should try it!

532
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Cut the crap!

533
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,280
Jinghui, come on!

534
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,440
Only one time last.

535
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
Come on!

536
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,920
Cheer up!

537
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,560
Wait for me!

538
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,480
Come on, master!

539
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,280
Cheer up!

540
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,280
Cheer up!

541
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,320
Come on, Jinghui!

542
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,040
Come on, Jinghui!

543
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,440
The method works.

544
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,840
What?

545
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,200
So you knew all along that

546
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,040
it's not an accident.

547
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,360
I didn't know that.

548
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,440
I just believed

549
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,720
Lan Jinghui wouldn't do

550
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
such a thing.

551
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,680
What do you think

552
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,120
about him?

553
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Well,

554
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,560
he's

555
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,160
like a hedgehog.

556
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,200
If I try to change

557
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,360
his character by force,

558
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,240
I'm afraid I will fail

559
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,400
and hurt him

560
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,360
in the end.

561
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,960
So I'm trying to

562
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
find a way

563
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
to make him

564
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,800
aware of his problems.

565
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,080
I want him to

566
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
accept others

567
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,200
from his heart.

568
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
You should pay

569
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,160
more attention to

570
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,520
Ling Dong and Jinghui.

571
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,760
If they can

572
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,840
become excellent,

573
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,960
then your class

574
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,800
will also be better.

575
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,240
I want you to remember that

576
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,120
education is

577
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,640
not about growing flowers.

578
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
Think about it.

579
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,520
So conservative!

580
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Not about growing flowers...

581
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,880
Lan Jinghui,

582
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,960
what are you doing here?

583
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
It's for you. No need to thank me.

584
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,840
Why?

585
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,640
Ms. Fang told me that

586
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,400
you made the recording.

587
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
I just don't want it

588
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,360
to interfere with my studies.

589
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,880
You don't need to thank me.

590
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,320
And thanks for helping me

591
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,640
at the gym.

592
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,480
Don't bother me again.

593
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,760
He's really conceited!

594
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,520
I ought to break your bike.

595
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,600
Lan Jinghui.

596
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,920
I was out of line that day.

597
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,640
Please forgive me.

598
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,880
I'll lend you my

599
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,280
physics notes.

600
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
Here are my notes for Chinese.

601
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,680
And for math.

602
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,560
For political courses.

603
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,520
These are my exclusive notes.

604
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,720
These are the

605
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,600
best chips.

606
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,400
Thank you.

607
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,280
Not for you.

608
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,280
Master!

609
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,080
I'll buy you breakfast every day!

610
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,280
What are you doing!

611
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm long past being angry.

612
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,360
Jinghui.

613
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,560
Please take care in the future.

614
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,840
Now you know to call

615
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,160
him Jinghui!

616
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,080
So how did you

617
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,000
confront Bi Peng that day?

618
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,120
Tell us about it!

619
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,920
Yes!

620
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,280
Well,

621
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,720
it was very exciting.

622
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,280
Tell us!

623
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,080
Tell us about it!

624
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,200
What was it like?

625
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
At that time,

626
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,840
Bi Peng quickly threw

627
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,920
the basketball

628
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,240
out of his hand.

629
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,240
It was a very

630
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,760
dangerous situation.

631
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,040
And I would be injured carelessly.

632
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,400
I had a hundred ways

633
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,200
of avoiding him

634
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,880
in my head.

635
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,040
In the end

636
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,320
I chose a

637
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,440
risky approach.

638
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,880
And the basketball flew

639
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,800
right by my hair.

640
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,800
At last

641
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,920
I dodged his attack

642
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,440
and defeated him

643
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,520
easily with

644
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,440
my killing skill.

645
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,760
What if I did it?

646
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,160
Can you prove it?

647
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,400
You...

648
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,160
I happened to see

649
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
the "Best Ball in the World"

650
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,400
when I passed.

651
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,400
What if I did it?

652
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,920
Can you prove it?

653
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,320
You...

654
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,720
I happened to see

655
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,680
the "Best Ball in the World"

656
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,080
when I passed.

657
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,800
What do you mean, Lan Jinghui?

658
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,040
Are you laughing at me?

659
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,400
I did it on purpose.

660
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,280
It's no use

661
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,920
knowing that I did it.

662
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,120
You have no proof.
