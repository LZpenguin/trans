00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,120
Bright Time EP20

3
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,960
Haha.

4
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,120
Hahaha.

5
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,240
Hahaha.

6
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,920
There you are.

7
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,840
Hey,

8
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,480
warming up?

9
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Let me add some firewood for you.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,720
Hahaha.

11
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,480
Hey,

12
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,680
am I not laughing loud enough?

13
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
Hahaha.

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,920
Huh.

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,280
Well,

16
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,080
it's pretty warm.

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,720
You know,

18
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,760
Xu Chao and Ruosi

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,800
said they had a stomachache,

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,840
so I heroically volunteered

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,760
for the night watch.

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Can't leave you alone,

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,560
right?

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,400
The weather's great tonight.

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,600
Clear skies.

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,680
It's pretty foggy.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
Rare good weather,

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
so I'll sing you a song.

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,080
I'll sing that...

30
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,680
Shut it.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,120
Fine,

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,800
as you wish.

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,120
It's kind of creepy, singing at night.

34
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,360
How about

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,120
I tell you a ghost story?

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,240
That sound...

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,320
must be my stomach growling.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,560
Must be my upset stomach.

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,520
Must be...

40
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,360
Shut up.

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,080
Need to go to the bathroom.

42
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,240
How did you get in?

43
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,760
Hey.

44
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,600
Hey.

45
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,280
Listen.

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,840
Look,

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,360
why are you here?

48
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
You can go keep watch, you know.

49
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,880
I knew it.

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,720
You couldn't just leave me.

51
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,000
It's pretty dark here.

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
My... my precious phone!

53
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
Flashlight, flashlight.

54
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't.

55
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,040
That's even more obvious.

56
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
Not too bad.

57
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,520
A convenience store!

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,560
Hurry, hurry.

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,640
Yes,

60
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,480
take this, take this.

61
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,360
Stop hiding. I saw you two.

62
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,000
Go now while we can.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
Instant noodles, sausages.

64
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,600
What?

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,960
Go!

66
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,720
And instant noodles, sausages...

67
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
What's wrong with you?

68
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,440
Lan Jinghui!

69
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,800
Jinghui! Jinghui!

70
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,640
The instant noodles and sausages...

71
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,520
Well, screw it!

72
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,560
Stop!

73
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,240
Get back here!

74
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Which class are you from?

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,800
Which class!

76
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,840
Stop!

77
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,400
Stop right there!

78
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,680
Stop!

79
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,240
Stop!

80
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,960
Don't run!

81
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
You...

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,200
okay now?

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,480
You run pretty fast.

84
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,760
You...

85
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,360
also pretty fast.

86
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,080
No kidding.

87
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
Where'd you get this stuff?

88
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,960
Stop asking

89
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,400
and eat.

90
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,200
If you don't,

91
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,360
I'll throw it in the fire.

92
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,160
I'll eat, I'll eat.

93
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Are they getting along now?

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,400
Who's there?

95
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Xiaohua.

96
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
Instructor Wu.

97
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
What are you doing out here so late?

98
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,600
I... I'm

99
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,560
on night watch, Instructor Wu.

100
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,160
Alright,

101
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,600
it's late.

102
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,760
Go get some rest.

103
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,600
Thank you, Instructor Wu.

104
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,000
Wait!

105
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:22,960
Don't litter with

106
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,040
those prohibited items after you eat.

107
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
Got it.

108
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,520
Thank you.

109
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,280
A little girl running that fast?

110
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,160
Thanks for earlier.

111
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Why thank me?

112
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,280
No matter what I do,

113
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,080
it just proves

114
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
I'm not a bad person.

115
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
Still mad at me?

116
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,040
Why would I be mad?

117
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm just a hired hand.

118
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,480
I was wrong.

119
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,720
When I

120
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,880
found out,

121
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,200
I was furious.

122
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,400
You're my best friend.

123
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
I needed

124
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,560
an explanation

125
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,440
from you.

126
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,560
An answer.

127
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,400
I admit,

128
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,120
at first,

129
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
it was because of your father

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
that I agreed to watch you.

131
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,640
Otherwise,

132
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,120
with how

133
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,040
arrogant

134
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,960
and troublesome

135
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
you were,

136
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,280
do you expect

137
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,800
I'd willingly get close

138
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
and help you?

139
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,920
Was I really that annoying?

140
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,840
Yeah,

141
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,680
you were.

142
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,280
But

143
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,000
as I got to

144
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,960
know you,

145
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,880
I understood what

146
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
having a friend feels like.

147
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Lan Jinghui, you know,

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,160
even though

149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,440
you seem unreliable

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
and a bit silly,

151
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,360
you always

152
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,000
give your all for your friends.

153
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
Whether it's Xiaohua, Ma Yiming,

154
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,360
or me,

155
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,120
you always give your best.

156
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,320
I used to be alone,

157
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,480
but you changed that.

158
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,880
Look at you,

159
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
you either don't talk

160
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,840
or say

161
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,920
the most mushy things.

162
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,040
Actually, I've always wanted

163
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
to ask you something.

164
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,400
What?

165
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,000
Why did you react like that?

166
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,960
Like what?

167
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
In the locker room earlier.

168
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm afraid of the dark. Yeah.

169
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,880
Just that.

170
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,720
Fine,

171
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,640
not just that.

172
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,480
I might

173
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,520
also be scared of confined spaces,

174
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,840
and

175
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,120
sudden bright light.

176
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,720
Afraid of... light?

177
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,440
My parents divorced

178
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
when I was young,

179
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,880
and my mom

180
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,200
insisted on taking me abroad.

181
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,720
I didn't want to go,

182
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,640
so I

183
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:00,960
made a pact

184
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,760
with a good friend

185
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
to hide

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,520
until my mom left.

187
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,600
Does that mean we'll

188
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,840
never see each other again?

189
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't want to leave.

190
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,320
What if your mom insists on

191
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,480
taking you?

192
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,720
I can hide.

193
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,080
Hide?

194
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,200
Where?

195
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,840
That kid betrayed me,

196
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,120
told all the adults

197
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,400
about my little secret.

198
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,520
You have to keep my secret.

199
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,560
Don't tell anyone.

200
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,880
Pinky promise.

201
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Looking back, it was childish.

202
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,040
I hid alone

203
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,400
in an abandoned warehouse

204
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
behind the kindergarten.

205
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,640
No light,

206
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,880
no food,

207
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,040
no water.

208
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
All I remember next

209
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,440
is hearing footsteps

210
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
and seeing countless

211
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,680
flashlights shining in.

212
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,120
What happened then?

213
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,640
They found me

214
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,360
and took me back.

215
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,720
Maybe

216
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,440
subconsciously,

217
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,440
it wanted me to stay

218
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,560
and made me fear

219
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,000
confined spaces

220
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,720
and sudden bright lights.

221
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Do you still remember

222
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,680
the kid who betrayed you?

223
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,520
No.

224
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,120
I was too young.

225
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,240
Besides,

226
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,120
it's best

227
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,920
not to remember

228
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,720
people like that.

229
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,920
Maybe he didn't mean it that way.

230
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:44,840
What?

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,400
Nothing.

232
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,120
Wait,

233
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,160
why did I

234
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,080
just tell you all this?

235
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,040
No.

236
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,320
No, no.

237
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,920
Hey,

238
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,000
you have to tell me

239
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,600
one of your secrets,

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,320
now.

241
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,000
Come on, right now.

242
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,080
I... I don't have any secrets.

243
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,880
I don't believe you.

244
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,440
That face

245
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
says otherwise.

246
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,000
Really, I don't.

247
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,280
Did my dad tell you

248
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,240
you're not my uncle?

249
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,960
Yes.

250
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,240
Do you know who he is?

251
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,040
Who is he?

252
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,000
He's...

253
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
he's your uncle.

254
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,520
uncle?

255
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,360
Get out. Out.

256
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,160
Go ahead, out.

257
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,880
Ling Dong, about what I said earlier,

258
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
what do you say?

259
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,280
Mr. Lan,

260
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,760
I don't think

261
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
we're related, right?

262
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,560
And Mr. Zhang said

263
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,840
my sponsor wanted to meet me.

264
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,440
That must be you, right?

265
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,000
Can I ask

266
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,320
why you're sponsoring me?

267
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,960
I...

268
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,960
Well,

269
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,200
it's a long story.

270
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,240
Ling Dong, sit down and let's talk.

271
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,960
Come on.

272
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,960
Sit.

273
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,560
Actually,

274
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,200
you and Shangjin

275
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,560
aren't related.

276
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,880
But

277
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Shangjin, me,

278
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,040
and

279
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
your father

280
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,960
have been friends

281
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,800
for over ten years.

282
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,360
With... my dad?

283
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,000
I won't go into details.

284
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,640
Dong,

285
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,640
you know

286
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,840
your mom

287
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,480
is quite strong-willed.

288
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,360
She doesn't like

289
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,360
accepting help,

290
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,520
so we didn't

291
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,480
tell you

292
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,360
to avoid burdening you.

293
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,560
Today, I came

294
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,720
to ask you...

295
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,720
What he means is, he wants you

296
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,400
to help Lan Jinghui improve.

297
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,000
Of course,

298
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,200
without affecting

299
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,400
your studies.

300
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
Lan Jinghui is

301
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,320
a bit of a troublemaker now,

302
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,200
but he

303
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,960
used to be

304
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
a good kid.

305
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,000
The reason he changed

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,680
is partly

307
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,520
my fault and his mom's.

308
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,320
Now,

309
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,800
it's a coincidence

310
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,240
that he transferred here,

311
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,160
and you're in the same class,

312
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,520
even desk mates.

313
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,080
So, I hope

314
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,800
you can

315
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,000
help him out.

316
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,240
Make him improve.

317
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,360
Besides,

318
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,440
your status is different now.

319
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,560
You're his uncle.

320
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,040
Yeah, uncle.

321
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,960
You can use that

322
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
to your advantage.

323
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,880
When he doesn't listen,

324
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,240
assert your authority,

325
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,000
right?

326
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,240
He has to listen to you.

327
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,280
If you can

328
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,680
help improve Lan Jinghui's studies,

329
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,120
Shangjin will be relieved.

330
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,320
He's kind-hearted,

331
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,240
so I guess he's agreed.

332
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
What a good kid.

333
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,160
Thank you.

334
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,840
Keep it up.

335
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,600
What?

336
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Ling Dong,

337
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,400
you're

338
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,080
too much!

339
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,720
You...

341
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,360
Are you okay? What's wrong?

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,440
Nothing,

343
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,080
my leg's just numb.

344
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm fine.

345
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,040
Are you dumb?

346
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,760
Is it still numb?

347
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,720
Are you okay?

348
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,640
No, I'm all right.

349
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,520
It's better now.

350
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,240
Nice night,

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,040
clear skies.

352
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,240
Lan Jinghui,

353
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,920
I meant it

354
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,560
when I said I'd be your uncle

355
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,840
for lifetime.

356
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,960
Want to keep taking advantage of me?

357
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,000
In your dreams.

358
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,280
Aren't you the one taking advantage?

359
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,200
Show-off.

360
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,160
You're squishing me.

361
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,120
You're squishing me.

362
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,440
You're squishing me.

363
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
You're squishing me.

364
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,880
Get off me.

365
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,880
No.

366
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,360
Last warning,

367
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
get off!

368
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
Buck up!

369
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,280
You starving or something?

370
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,400
Be careful.

371
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm alright.

372
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:18,840
You alright?

373
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,800
We can't afford

374
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,200
to lose another partner.

375
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,240
Left.

376
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,840
Right.

377
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,720
Left, right.

378
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
Right. Watch your arm movement.

379
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,880
Wait.

380
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,600
Keep your arms

381
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,440
closer to your body.

382
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,360
Wider swing

383
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,080
is throwing you off balance

384
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,000
and slowing you down.

385
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,720
I don't think so.

386
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,760
If she's still

387
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
getting the hang of it,

388
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,040
the big arm swings might help her

389
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,280
keep up with her steps.

390
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,800
No?

391
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,680
Just like this.

392
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,640
No, no.

393
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,560
He's wrong.

394
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,200
Do as I said.

395
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,720
What?

396
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,920
Forget what he said,

397
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,560
listen up.

398
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Trust your body

399
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
and how it feels.

400
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
What? What makes you

401
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,480
so sure your way

402
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,600
is better than mine?

403
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,960
I've never

404
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,840
claimed that.

405
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,000
I just follow my heart.

406
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,160
Follow your heart?

407
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,400
You've got heart?

408
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,720
Let's go.

409
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,960
But I think

410
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,040
you should

411
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,480
use your head.

412
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,200
You know?

413
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
Not just following your heart.

414
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,080
We're all feeling-driven beings.

415
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,680
Let's go.

416
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,800
Ready.

417
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,640
Go!

418
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,560
Go!

419
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,480
Go!

420
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,520
Go!

421
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,360
Go!

422
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,320
Go!

423
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,040
Go!

424
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,600
Go!

425
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,320
Go!

426
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,720
Go!

427
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,800
Go!

428
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,680
Go! Go!

429
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,920
Come on, Ruosi.

430
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,440
You ready?

431
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,680
Be careful!

432
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Go for it!

433
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,640
We will.

434
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:53,880
We will.

435
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,480
We're gonna

436
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,960
win the first place.

437
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,920
We will win, for sure.

438
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,200
Cause he doesn't want to lose.

439
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,480
We

440
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,040
You...

441
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,760
We...

442
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,280
You...

443
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,240
We will win!

444
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,880
Class 5!

445
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,480
Remember the drills,

446
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,000
stay focused,

447
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,200
and watch your step.

448
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:09,880
Ready?

449
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,640
One.

450
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,000
Two.

451
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,680
Three.

452
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,840
Go.

453
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,120
Go.

454
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,720
One, two.

455
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,160
Go.

456
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,320
One, two.

457
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,120
Go. Go.

458
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,680
One, two.

459
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,240
One, two.

460
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,880
One, two.

461
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,480
One, two.

462
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,600
Go.

463
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,000
One, two.

464
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,560
One, two.

465
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,120
One, two.

466
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,440
One, two.

467
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,880
She hurt?

468
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,480
I'll go check on her.

469
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,920
You alright?

470
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,760
Let them deal with that.

471
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,240
These kids

472
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,600
are used to being pampered,

473
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
they gotta toughen up

474
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,040
and learn a thing or two.

475
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,040
We're totally

476
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,720
on the same page, Ms. Fang and me.

477
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,640
Are you alright?

478
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,240
Can you keep pushing?

479
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
My ankle's sprained.

480
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,800
Can you keep running?

481
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,400
Yeah, I got this.

482
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,440
But...

483
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,760
Qingtian, we're gonna win!

484
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,480
We almost had it!

485
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,360
I promised you

486
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,720
I'd help you win first place.

487
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,680
It's okay, Qingtian.

488
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,280
Now I

489
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,760
kinda like being second place.

490
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,040
We were so close

491
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,880
so close

492
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,160
so close to winning.

493
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,520
We practiced so hard.

494
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,360
One, two.

495
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,320
One, two.

496
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Go.

497
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,920
Go.

498
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Slow down. Take it easy.

499
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,000
Go for it!

500
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,880
Go. Go.

501
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,480
One.

502
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,400
Almost there.

503
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,000
Go.

504
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,280
Come on, Xiaohua.

505
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,200
One, two.

506
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,520
Go. Go.

507
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,080
Go. Xiaohua.

508
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,880
Go.

509
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,560
Two.

510
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,080
Watch out.

511
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,800
One, two.

512
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,160
It's okay.

513
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,480
Slow down.

514
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,040
Take it easy.

515
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,120
One, two.

516
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
One, two.

517
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,720
One, two.

518
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,560
Go.

519
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Go. Go. Go.

520
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,520
Go. Go.

521
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,000
Be careful.

522
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,760
You're the best.

523
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,240
Good job.

524
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
My bad.

525
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,240
We practiced so much for nothing.

526
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,000
It's not your fault at all.

527
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,640
Finishing is winning

528
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,200
in my book.

529
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,840
Right?

530
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,480
And look,

531
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,280
even the "First Place or Die" guy

532
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,160
didn't complain.

533
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,880
It's also a kind of first place.

534
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,040
Just in reverse.

535
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,840
It's a unique experience,

536
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
gotta admit.

537
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,000
Heat that?

538
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,160
And our team's a beast, gotta let the

539
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,600
others taste victory once in a while.

540
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,320
Jinghui.

541
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,280
Thanks.

542
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
You got lucky this time.

543
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,760
Qingtian.

544
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,440
There's a bonfire party later,

545
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
wanna help me start the fire?

546
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Nah, I'm not feeling it.

547
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,160
You still

548
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,080
bummed about

549
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,000
the loss?

550
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,840
Promised I'd help you win.

551
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,880
It's okay.

552
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,800
Qingtian.

553
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Look.

554
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,240
Where did you get them?

555
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,960
I passed by the kitchen and...

556
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,440
Gosh.

557
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
Chen. You look

558
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,480
all innocent,

559
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:21,800
but you're...

560
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Given by the kitchen staff.

561
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,000
But it's raw.

562
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,000
That's why I ask you

563
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,920
to start the fire with me.

564
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,640
I want it roasted.

565
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,320
Go.

566
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,760
Go.

567
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,200
Come here.

568
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,160
Get going.

569
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,800
Hurry.

570
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,800
Move faster!

571
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,560
Ma Yiming, chop-chop.

572
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
Faster.

573
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
Hurry up.

574
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay.

575
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,520
Alright, let me explain

576
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,360
the game rules.

577
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,440
Game's called

578
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,680
"King's Game".

579
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,280
King card

580
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
gives you power

581
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,920
to pick two cards,

582
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
those two

583
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,800
are a team.

584
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,880
You can

585
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,400
make them do anything.

586
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,720
If they can't,

587
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,760
they'll have to

588
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,680
drink black garlic juice as punishment.

589
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,440
Now.

590
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,720
Who's got the King?

591
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,160
Me, me.

592
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,600
Jinghui, Jinghui.

593
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,720
So it'll be...

594
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,800
Diamond ten

595
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,240
and black spade eight.

596
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,200
Who's got black spade eight?

597
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,200
And who's diamond ten?

598
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,720
Diamond ten?

599
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,320
Where's diamond ten?

600
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,760
Who's got it?

601
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
Diamond ten.

602
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,920
Now, diamond ten?

603
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,680
Well...

604
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,760
A love song duet

605
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,800
it is.

606
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,240
Sing! Sing!

607
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,040
Sing! Sing!

608
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,440
Sing! Sing!

609
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,040
I'll take the punishment.

610
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,280
No, no.

611
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,760
I cheated, I'll drink it.

612
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,360
Bro, did you just mess up?

613
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
That bad?

614
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,000
Well...

615
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,360
Now. Keep the game rolling!

616
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,600
Hand over your

617
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,160
cards.

618
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,520
Alright.

619
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,960
Back to your seat.

620
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,560
Alright.

621
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,280
Your card, please.

622
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,880
Alright.

623
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,120
Give me your card.

624
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,200
Card.

625
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,560
Okay.

626
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,480
Jinghui.

627
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,920
The juice

628
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,120
is nasty.

629
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,080
Who came up with this?

630
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,400
Glad Mengyu didn't get it.

631
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,800
Mengyu.

632
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,080
Such a troublemaker.

633
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,680
You deserve it.

634
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,680
Mengyu.

635
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,800
Okay.

636
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,200
Now, for this round.

637
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,360
Who's the King?

638
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,520
Me, me, me.

639
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,560
Choose your cards.

640
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Red heart jack.

641
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,440
Red jack is

642
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,000
giving red ace

643
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,640
a piggyback ride

644
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,280
around the field!

645
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,200
Ma Yiming.

646
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Ma Yiming

647
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,960
Now.

648
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,720
Who's the King now?

649
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,480
Me!

650
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,320
You're lucky this round!

651
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,160
So please,

652
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,840
name your cards.

653
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,440
I choose black spade two

654
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,960
and black spade eight.

655
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,240
What do you want them to do?

656
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,560
I wanna see them give each other

657
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
a big, tight hug.

658
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,680
Okay, number eight,

659
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,600
please stand up.

660
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,640
Alright.

661
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,480
Okay.

662
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,400
It's Ling Dong.

663
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,320
Great,

664
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,920
the eight is here.

665
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,440
Now, let's welcome the two.

666
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,440
Black spade two.

667
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,880
Isn't black spade two a girl?

668
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,560
This is getting exciting.

669
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,680
Who could it be?

670
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
It's gonna be

671
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,360
awkward.

672
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,240
Yeah.

673
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,600
Black spade two.

674
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,640
Black spade two.

675
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,000
Black spade two.

676
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,280
If black spade two doesn't come out,

677
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,640
I'm collecting everyone's cards.

678
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,400
Three.

679
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,280
Two.

680
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,680
It's me.

681
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,240
Give him a hug.

682
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,440
Congrats.

683
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,680
Hug.

684
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,600
Hug.

685
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,600
Hug. Hug. Hug.

686
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,640
I can't... Can't...

687
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
breathe...

688
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,480
A big one for you.

689
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,400
Mam, two ice creams.

690
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,040
Two?

691
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,600
Here you are.

692
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,640
Mam.

693
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,360
I'll take six.

694
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:10,920
Six?

695
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,640
Yeah. Six.

696
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,240
Thank you.

697
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,640
Mam.

698
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,240
Give me

699
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,960
three ice creams.

700
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,640
Three?

701
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,200
We only have two.

702
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,520
Only two.

703
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,520
Will do.

704
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,280
It's okay.

705
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,280
A big chicken leg for you.

706
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,000
No veggies?

707
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Here.

708
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,400
What?

709
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,040
Just two?

710
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,960
What about you?

711
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
I... I just finished it.

712
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,320
Feeling like I'm coming back to life.

713
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,440
Is it good?

714
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,640
Take a bite, come on.

715
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,280
Eating cold then hot.

716
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,480
Watch your tummy.
