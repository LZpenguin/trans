Bright Time EP21

3
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,040
Hug him!

4
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,240
Congrats!

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,480
Hug him!

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,400
Hug him!

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,400
Hug him! Hug him!

8
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,400
I...Can't breathe...

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,480
Can't breathe...

10
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
So difficult!

11
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Get over there, there!

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
What's this?

13
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,920
What is it?

14
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,280
I think Class 5 is outstanding.

15
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,720
Mr. Zhao, what's wrong?

16
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm fine.

17
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm fine, Ms. Fang.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,080
I just,

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
seeing these students,

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,040
I just think,

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,280
it's great to be young.

22
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,160
I think I'm young as well.

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,440
That's true.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,880
Actually, I've been meaning to ask you.

25
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,720
Ms. Fang, do you have a boyfriend?

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,200
Boyfriend?

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,120
I go to school everyday,

28
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,040
to teach them.

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,760
Finally, there's a weekend,

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and I got dragged here for training.

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,080
Do you really think I've got time

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,640
to date anyone?

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,560
So,

34
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,920
Ms. Fang, what is your

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,840
favourite type?

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,680
I mean,

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,800
what type of guy

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,000
are you into?

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,440
What type am I into?

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
I really haven't thought about it.

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,760
I think it's about feeling.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,440
But,

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,960
regarding the type I don't like,

44
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,880
I'm quite clear about it.

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
So what type

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,280
don't you like?

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,800
I don't like

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,920
guys who wear sportswear every day.

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,600
Coach, bye-bye.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,080
Bye!

51
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,800
See ya, instructor!

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,840
See you!

53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,680
Don't cause

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,600
any trouble for Ms. Fang, OK?

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,080
OK.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,200
Ms. Fang,

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,600
please visit us when you got time.

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,200
OK.

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Thanks for your help,

60
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,120
instructor.

61
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Don't mention it.

62
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Ms. Fang!

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,400
Hey.

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
Let's go on the same bus.

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,320
Alright.

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,920
Mr. Zhao.

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,720
Mr. Wu,

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
thanks for your hospitality.

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,480
No problem.

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,280
Come and visit us.

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,080
Sure.

72
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,040
You should get going.

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,560
See you!

74
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,360
Bye.

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,120
How do I look, Ms. Fang?

76
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,000
I think...

77
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,520
You should stick to wearing sportswear.

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,840
I don't look good in this?

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
It seems this training

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,920
really wore them out.

81
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,240
They're all asleep.

82
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,200
Yeah.

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,240
Ms. Fang.

84
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,000
Huh?

85
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
This really doesn't look good?

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,800
What?

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,280
This whole...

88
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,080
Ah.

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Oh.

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
It...It's OK.

91
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,720
Right?

92
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,240
I thought it was ok too.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,760
I've spent some time picking it out.

94
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,000
Back then, the future

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,520
seemed so distant it had no shape.

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,160
Every day's troubles were

97
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,520
only homework and the people around us.

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,400
Even if the day before

99
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
we argued until we were red in the face,

100
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
we could make up

101
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,560
after a few apologies.

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,000
Maybe

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,440
this is the privilege of youth.

104
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,040
Guys,

105
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,840
your physical test

106
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,120
results are out.

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,800
This time

108
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
everyone's shown significant improvement.

109
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
Most of you

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
have passed.

111
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
This proves that our last training

112
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,280
was very effective.

113
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,640
You all did very well.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,760
So, remember,

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
it's important to work out

116
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,200
in addition to your studies.

117
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,880
Alright?

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,160
Yes, ma'am!

119
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Chen Luyang, Ling Dong,

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,440
you two,

121
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,360
go to the office.

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Mr. Guo is looking for you.

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,440
- OK - Xu Mengyu,

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,040
come up and post

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,480
this score sheet.

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,000
OK.

127
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,760
Over there.

128
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,680
Alright,

129
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,040
although many of you

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,360
have passed this time,

131
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,680
there are still some

132
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
who have not.

133
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
I still hope

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,440
that you could spend some time

135
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
working out

136
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,320
when you are free,

137
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,960
oK?

138
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Yes, ma'am!

139
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,840
Alright, go ahead and

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
check your scores.

141
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,480
Mr. Guo.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,520
Hello, Mr. Guo.

144
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,560
For the national physics competition,

145
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,080
the school has decided

146
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,240
to let you two represent the school

147
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,160
and compete in Jing City.

148
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,440
The results of this competition

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,160
concern not only your future

150
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,160
but also the honor of our school.

151
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,920
Ms. Fang and I will take you there then.

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Do your best,

153
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,600
alright?

154
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,800
Don't worry, Mr. Guo,

155
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,200
I will definitely give my best.

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,840
Sir,

157
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,640
if there's nothing else,

158
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm going back then.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,360
One sec,

160
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,680
the days after your competition

161
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,640
happen to be Jing University's open days.

162
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,280
There will be a lecture by Professor Yang.

163
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,560
You can check it out if you're interested.

164
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,200
These days,

165
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,440
the physics room will be open for you.

166
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,640
If you have any questions,

167
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,240
feel free to ask me anytime.

168
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,960
Do you know if

169
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,720
Mr. Guo asked Ling Dong and Chen Luoyang

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,320
to represent the entire school

171
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,400
in the national physics competition?

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,360
There's no doubt about it.

173
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,720
It must be it.

174
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,840
Participating in such competitions

175
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,840
and winning a place

176
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,960
may earn you credits for entering college.

177
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,720
Extra credits?

178
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,080
For real?

179
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah.

180
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,360
Hey, they're already top students

181
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
and still getting extra credits.

182
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,480
What about us

183
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,080
ordinary people?

184
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,200
Yeah.

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,760
But there's only

186
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,560
one first place.

187
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,040
That's probably Ling Dong.

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,760
I feel sorry for Chen Luyang.

189
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,560
As long as there's Ling Dong,

190
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,960
he'll always be the eternal second place.

191
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,400
Hi, Chen Luyang.

192
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,440
That one, right?

193
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,480
Seems like it.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,600
That's good.

195
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,720
It's all about representing our school.

196
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,880
It doesn't matter who's first or second.

197
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,120
You're right.

198
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,200
It doesn't matter.

199
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,360
It doesn't matter.

200
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,440
Right.

201
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,400
It doesn't matter.

202
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Let's go back to the classroom.

203
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,280
Let's go.

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,160
What did Mr. Guo want with you?

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,840
He said I should participate

206
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,800
in the national physics competition.

207
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh.

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Jing University Open Days?

209
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,480
Ling Dong,

210
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
are you planning to go there?

211
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,960
What's it about? Is it fun?

212
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,760
It's an event Jing University holds.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,360
It's going to be a week

214
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,920
to attract new students.

215
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,400
I heard their Department of Fine Arts

216
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,560
has an art exhibition every year.

217
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
I'd really love to go.

218
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
If you want to go, we can just go.

219
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,320
I need to prepare for the competition.

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,080
I might not have time.

221
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,040
That's true.

222
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,720
Plus, this event is super popular.

223
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
Even though they distribute

224
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
tickets every year,

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,640
the number of people who go there

226
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,600
is just too large.

227
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,400
Tickets are incredibly hard to get.

228
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,480
Is that so?

229
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,160
Chen Luyang, are you OK?

230
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,040
Qingtian,

231
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm fine.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
You look

233
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,120
a bit pale.

234
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,440
Is it because you've been

235
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,080
preparing for the physics competition

236
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
and didn't get enough sleep?

237
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,280
I am feeling a bit of stressed,

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
but it's oK.

239
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't worry about me.

240
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,600
Have a lollipop.

241
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
Whenever I'm under a lot of pressure,

242
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,520
I'll just have a lollipop.

243
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,560
It makes me feel like everything's better.

244
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,880
Thank you.

245
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,400
No problem.

246
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,960
There's nothing

247
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,040
that a lollipop can't fix.

248
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,920
If there is, then have two.

249
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,600
Goodbye, ma'am!

250
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,720
Goodbye, guys.

251
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
Let's all go to the cafeteria.

252
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,200
Let's go.

253
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,520
Nah, I'm not going.

254
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,440
You have to eat.

255
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,920
Food is as vital to people

256
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,080
as steel is to machines.

257
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
I have no appetite.

258
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
You guys go ahead.

259
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,360
Forget it,

260
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,400
he's already

261
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,160
in his maniac mode.

262
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Mere mortals won't be able to understand.

263
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,160
Let's go eat.

264
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,280
We'll bring him food.

265
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,800
Come on, we'll bring him food.

266
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,280
Alright, alright,

267
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,920
let's go.

268
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,640
Dear lord,

269
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,000
did you see the video yesterday?

270
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,280
Jia was super-hot!

271
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,520
Yeah, yeah.

272
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,000
That voice was amazing, you know?

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,040
It was fantastic!

274
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
I got goosebumps, seriously!

275
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,640
Yeah.

276
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,880
That vibrato is really something.

277
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,720
Let's go, Jinghui!

278
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,320
Let's shoot some hoops!

279
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,720
That's it for today's class.

280
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,000
Take some time to take it all in.

281
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,760
Dismissed.

282
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,640
Stand up.

283
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,800
Goodbye, sir.

284
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,800
Nah, I can't, sitting in the same room

285
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,560
with him is too stressful.

286
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,360
Ling Dong, you...

287
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,520
Do you know what the dieticians say?

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,040
If you don't eat properly,

289
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,760
it will impact your intelligence.

290
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,360
If you want to win the competition,

291
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,080
you've got to eat.

292
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,960
They also say

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,880
you can't drink freshly boiled water.

294
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,600
Why is that?

295
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
Because it's hot.

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,080
Stop being so contrary with me.

297
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,200
Anyway, now

298
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,960
you have to eat.

299
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,600
Just eat it.

300
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,360
OK, oK.

301
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,880
Health is of utmost importance,

302
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,040
so you must eat properly.

303
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,120
I know how to solve it now.

304
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,600
Give it back.

305
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,640
Practice is one thing,

306
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,240
you can't neglect food and sleep.

307
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,400
You've got to eat!

308
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,240
Sorry.

309
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,840
This the last time I brought you food.

310
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,120
Hey, why are you still here?

311
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,600
What?

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,720
Any chance you have more lollipops?

313
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,120
This is the last piece I have.

314
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,040
But looks like you could use a pick-me-up,

315
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,120
so it's yours.

316
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,720
Chen Luyang,

317
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,840
you seem a bit off lately, what's up?

318
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,680
It's nothing, really.

319
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,920
Take this, it's for you.

320
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,240
The Qingtian (sunny) doll.

321
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,360
It's like having

322
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,760
Xia Qingtian right with you.

323
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,120
But it's yours.

324
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Let it be a

325
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
source of strength for you.

326
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
Best of luck with the physics competition!

327
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,840
Thanks.

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,680
Ling Dong!

329
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,920
Ling Dong, bad news!

330
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,640
What's the matter? What's going on?

331
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,600
It's Lan Jinghui, Lan Jinghui...

332
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,960
Take a breath and tell me what happened.

333
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,440
He got into a conflict

334
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
with someone off-campus.

335
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,440
Where is he now?

336
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,880
I'm sorry, Ling Dong.

337
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,800
I lied to you.

338
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,800
Hey,

339
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,800
I haven't finished a problem yet.

340
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,640
You're already here, so stay a while.

341
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,760
Lan Jinghui!

342
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,800
Seriously,

343
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,760
Xiaohua,

344
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,680
why are you picking up his bad habits?

345
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,880
Don't be mad at her.

346
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
It was my idea.

347
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,360
Have a seat.

348
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Sit!

349
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,440
You've been studying

350
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,360
so hard these

351
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,280
past few days.

352
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,440
You've lost weight from not eating enough.

353
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,640
Look,

354
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,200
I've prepared this just for you,

355
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,680
a feast to nourish your brain.

356
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,920
You're off to the capital tomorrow, right?

357
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,360
Consider this meal a farewell from bro.

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,560
Bro?

359
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,520
aren't you getting

360
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,640
our relationship a bit mixed up?

361
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,960
It's close enough.

362
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,120
Plus, it's about eating the right foods.

363
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Try these,

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I ordered them just for you:

365
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,640
pig brain soup,

366
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,040
egg-fried pig brain,

367
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,080
braised pig brain,

368
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,880
pig brain stew,

369
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,520
grilled pig brain,

370
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,840
and fish stew.

371
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,200
That's just right.

372
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,080
You should eat more.

373
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,160
It's all about eating the right foods.

374
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,640
Here.

375
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,200
Thanks (screw you).

376
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm the one being grateful (screw you).

377
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,280
It's me, Ms. Fang!

378
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,880
Sorry, Mr. Zhao!

379
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,040
My apologies,

380
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,040
are you alright?

381
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm oK, I'm oK.

382
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,160
What brings you here?

383
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,880
Where's Mr. Guo?

384
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,600
I'll be accompanying you to Jing City.

385
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,240
Mr. Guo had a family issue,

386
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,360
so Mr. Zhang asked me to go with you.

387
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm really sorry for what I did.

388
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,920
It's fine.

389
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,360
Shall we

390
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
go get our boarding pass for the train?

391
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:04,880
Sure.

392
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,760
Let's go.

393
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,600
Ms. Fang, that was

394
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,320
quite some impressive move back there.

395
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,160
Surprise!

396
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,160
Surprise!

397
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,960
What are you all doing here?

398
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
We...

399
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,040
Of course

400
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,200
are off to have fun in Jing City.

401
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,480
It's the May Day long vacation,

402
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,200
and Xiaohua's never been to the city.

403
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,520
So, I thought

404
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,640
I'd take her to broaden her horizons,

405
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,640
right?

406
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,760
Exactly, exactly.

407
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,400
And you, Qingtian?

408
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,960
Why are you here?

409
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,800
Well, I'm obviously

410
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,360
going to the city's food festival

411
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
to hit up all the trendy spots.

412
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,840
Here you go.

413
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,800
Thanks, Qingtian.

414
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,920
Prof. Yang's seminar at Jing University?

415
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,760
What's the matter?

416
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,640
Nothing.

417
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
You've been holding that the whole time.

418
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:11,880
Just curious.

419
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,720
You're not really into this, are you?

420
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,080
Nah. Just a peek.

421
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,160
Ling Dong.

422
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,920
Ms. Fang.

423
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,320
Ms. Fang.

424
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Mr. Zhao.

425
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,160
Why are you here?

426
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,520
We...

427
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,320
I...

428
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,120
We...

429
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,520
Just going to Jing City for some fun.

430
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,520
All three of you?

431
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,680
Right.

432
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,880
Are your parents cool

433
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,840
with this?

434
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,480
Yeah,

435
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,600
they're

436
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,720
totally on board.

437
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,520
Got it all sorted out.

438
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,000
Let's go.

439
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,320
Yeah?

440
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,760
We're gonna miss the train

441
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,320
if we don't move.

442
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,520
Okay.

443
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,080
Listen up,

444
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
you can enjoy yourselves,

445
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,880
but I gotta

446
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
make one thing clear.

447
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,120
Don't mess around.

448
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,240
If I catch wind of

449
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,120
any shenanigans,

450
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
I'll send you back straight away.

451
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,240
Let's go.

452
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,960
Go.

453
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,040
Go get the tickets!

454
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,440
Go, chop-chop.

455
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,040
We gotta hurry.

456
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,840
How's it?

457
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,120
That dome ceiling and green scenery

458
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
make the air

459
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,240
feel cleaner, huh?

460
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,960
It's refreshing.

461
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,240
But kinda chilly.

462
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,640
Yeah?

463
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,040
Whoa,

464
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,800
check out those peacocks.

465
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,440
Gorgeous!

466
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,200
Yeah.

467
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,040
Lan Jinghui.

468
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,440
So this is the hotel

469
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
you said you got us?

470
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,280
Yep.

471
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,360
Pretty awesome, huh?

472
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,400
Nope.

473
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,880
Firstly, I'm here on a business trip,

474
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,440
and they're here to study for exams.

475
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
Only the three of you

476
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,320
are here

477
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,160
just for leisure.

478
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,200
This hotel's way

479
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,000
too fancy for us.

480
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,400
Besides,

481
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,840
we don't have the budget for it.

482
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,680
Ms. Fang.

483
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,120
Ms. Fang.

484
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,680
I know, I got it.

485
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,480
But this hotel

486
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,000
has close

487
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
business ties with my dad.

488
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,480
So we're getting

489
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,080
a sweet deal.

490
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,440
It's like

491
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,200
a budget hotel,

492
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,760
but nicer.

493
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,680
And I'm sure

494
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,320
you math and

495
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:08,720
physics geniuses

496
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,680
are exhausted,

497
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
you need some rest

498
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,240
in a chill spot.

499
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,840
Am I right?

500
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,640
Yes, right.

501
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,200
Ms. Fang.

502
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,040
Let's just stay here.

503
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,440
You sure it's within budget?

504
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,960
Absolutely.

505
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,880
Let me be clear,

506
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,920
since I brought you guys out,

507
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,200
I gotta keep tabs on you.

508
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,440
If you're going out,

509
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,680
keep me in the loop,

510
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,720
alright?

511
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,160
No problem.

512
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,120
And

513
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,400
back to the hotel

514
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,240
by 8 sharp,

515
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,760
hear me?

516
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,680
And

517
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,640
remember,

518
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,640
our main purpose here

519
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
is to support Ling Dong and Chen Luyang.

520
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,840
So

521
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,080
without my permission,

522
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,800
don't step

523
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,640
near their rooms

524
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,720
to give them

525
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,640
a peaceful study environment.

526
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,520
Hear me?

527
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,760
Especially you.

528
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,680
Lan Jinghui.

529
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,240
No problem.

530
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,520
Let's go check in.

531
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,120
Let's go.

532
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,960
Wait, wait.

533
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,640
It's so cute.

534
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,920
It looks like you, doesn't it?

535
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,240
Me?

536
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,280
Give me a grin.

537
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,240
Exactly the same.

538
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,680
Yeah?

539
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,840
Yeah.

540
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,080
Isn't it Nerd Ling?

541
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,320
You're right.

542
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,880
You've got his vibe down pat.

543
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,080
Yeah?

544
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,440
Right.

545
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,040
And this is Ma Yiming.

546
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,680
Ma Yiming.

547
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,960
Spot on.

548
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,000
Lan Jinghui.

549
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,560
This is you.

550
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,480
Like a clone.

551
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Channel your inner doll.

552
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:32,720
You got it.

553
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,280
Am I really like that?

554
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,280
Yup, spot on.

555
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Not even close.

556
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,440
It's you.

557
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,640
Down to a T.

558
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Which one's my doppelganger?

559
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,920
You've all got yours.

560
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,280
I think this one looks a lot like you.

561
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,080
Yeah, this is the one.

562
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,440
Am I really this cute?

563
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,640
Totally.

564
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,160
It's too loud!

565
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,440
Unbearable!

566
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,680
Dancing all night

567
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,840
and now during the day?

568
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm over it.

569
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,040
It's getting late.

570
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Where is he?

571
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,760
Slower

572
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,000
than snails.

573
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
Sleep in or what?

574
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,160
Calling him now.

575
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,720
It's him.

576
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
Sorry I'm late.

577
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,640
What took you so long?

578
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,640
I overslept.

579
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,920
We got back

580
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,520
early last night.

581
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,560
You're still tired?

582
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,560
I was up all night on Zelda.

583
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
So addictive.

584
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,160
Those horse-men are brutal.

585
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,880
I don't get it.

586
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Let's move.

587
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,680
Or we'll miss breakfast.

588
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,160
Okay.

589
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,320
Let's go.

590
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,600
Yeah.

591
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,000
Ms. Fang.

592
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,120
We got a bit

593
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,960
carried away, huh?

594
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,400
Can we really finish all this?

595
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,440
Nah, just some veggies.

596
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,640
They're studying

597
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,040
for exams,

598
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,800
but eating takeout all the time

599
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,680
which is heavy on oil and salt.

600
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,120
They need these greens.

601
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,400
So I'm gonna whip up

602
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
something good tonight.

603
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,480
Let's see.

604
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,080
What else do we need?

605
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,080
You catch a cold?

606
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,440
I think

607
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,040
the hotel AC's blasting

608
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,120
gave me a chill.

609
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,440
Here, cold instant granules.

610
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,480
Go back and dissolve it in water.

611
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,480
Appreciate the concern,

612
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,760
thanks.

613
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,880
It's not like that.

614
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
It's just, you know,

615
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,320
a crucial time.

616
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,200
Don't give

617
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,560
the students your cold.

618
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,720
Don't worry, I won't.

619
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,560
Okay.

620
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,520
Right.

621
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,400
Need some pork ribs.

622
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,160
Hold on a sec.

623
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,360
I'll go, be right back.

624
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,880
Alright, I want spareribs.

625
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,280
Yeah, got it.

626
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,120
Miss.

627
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,760
You're gonna cook all this?

628
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,680
Yeah.

629
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,320
Looks like you're not just pretty,

630
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,000
but also a fantastic cook.

631
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,600
Miss.

632
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,680
What do you do for work?

633
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,800
I'm a high school teacher.

634
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
It's nice.

635
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,960
My son's

636
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,400
tall

637
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,520
and handsome.

638
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,560
But he's been busy with work.

639
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,040
So he's still single.

640
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,720
Maybe you two can hit it off?

641
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,880
Friend me.

642
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,000
Let's go.

643
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,600
The kids are waiting for us.

644
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,840
What? Miss.

645
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,240
You look so young,

646
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,600
got kids already?

647
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,320
She's youthful-looking,

648
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
but we're parents of five already.

649
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,560
Wow, can't tell at all.

650
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,160
Bye.

651
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,160
Let's go.

652
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,880
Five kids already?

653
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,600
Seriously?

654
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,800
That's crazy talk.

655
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,840
Two in books,

656
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,920
three out playing.

657
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,880
Makes five, right?

658
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,880
Just trying to

659
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,640
save the day here.

660
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,600
Well...

661
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,880
What if I do wanna friend her?

662
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,400
Well... Seen Lan and the girls?

663
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,800
Haven't

664
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,560
caught sight all day.

665
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,480
They hit you up?

666
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,120
Nope.

667
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,520
Quick, call them up.

668
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Chill, they're fine.

669
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,480
Alright.

670
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,160
Probably having a blast somewhere.

671
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,320
Let me.

672
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,800
Okay.

673
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,960
Well.

674
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,760
Tell them to

675
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,800
come back for dinner

676
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,280
and keep it early.

677
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,160
Soup's on.

678
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:26,920
Here.

679
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,640
Ms. Fang

680
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,600
whipped these up

681
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,680
in the hotel kitchen.

682
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,720
Dig in while hot.

683
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,160
Crush that exam tomorrow.

684
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,520
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

685
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,200
Thanks, Ms. Fang.

686
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,760
Here, Luyang.

687
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,560
Delicious!

688
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,760
You guys haven't

689
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,040
been eating properly lately.

690
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Help yourselves.

691
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,000
Here, Ms. Fang.

692
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,080
I've been eating pretty well these days,

693
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,640
thanks for the late-night noms, Ms. Fang.

694
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,480
Late-night noms?

695
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,280
What?

696
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,920
But I

697
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,000
didn't.

698
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,800
Ms. Fang.

699
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,560
Ms. Fang.

700
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,280
Xiaohua, Qingtian.

701
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,920
Come and sit.

702
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,920
Ms. Fang.

703
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,400
You made all of this?

704
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,120
Looks amazing.

705
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,760
Quick, dig in!

706
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,440
Thank you.

707
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:07,800
Right.

708
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,880
Just you two?

709
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,840
Where's Lan?

710
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
Isn't he back yet?

711
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,880
Lan said he had business,

712
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
so he bailed early.

713
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,120
Give him a ring and see what's up.

714
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:19,960
Help yourself.

715
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,520
Excuse me.

716
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,120
Ms. Fang.

717
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
This is seriously good eating!

718
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,640
Yeah?

719
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Anytime you're hungry,

720
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,120
just swing by my place,

721
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,000
I'll whip up something tasty.

722
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,520
Have some more.

723
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,440
You guys fill up?

724
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,240
Okay.

725
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,240
Hit the hay

726
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Hit the hay

727
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,760
don't burn the midnight oil.

728
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,040
Good luck on

729
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,040
the exam tomorrow,

730
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,160
hope you ace it!

731
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,160
Alright, go now.

732
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,280
Gonna have another bite.

733
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,440
Yeah, Qingtian, fill your belly.

734
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,280
Go.

735
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,040
Bye.

736
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,520
Bye.

737
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,040
Bye.

738
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,560
Good night.

739
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,640
Thanks.

740
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,200
Bye.

741
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,520
Bye.

742
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:58,800
Bye.

743
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,640
Good night.

744
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,400
Qingtian,  what's

745
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,720
your favorite dish?

746
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,080
I'm not picky.

747
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,840
What took you

748
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,640
so long on the phone?

749
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,720
I hit up his room,

750
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,280
no one there.

751
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,840
Scoured

752
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,200
the hotel,

753
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,720
still missing.

754
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,960
Where could he be?

755
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Phone's off the hook too.

756
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,400
Give me your phone, I'll call him.

757
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,240
Okay.

758
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
I knew he would cause trouble

759
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,280
as soon as he stepped out.

760
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,880
Any weird

761
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,760
behavior from him lately?

762
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,560
Nah, doesn't look like it.

763
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,680
I'm getting a weird vibe from him.

764
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,560
What did he mention before taking off?

765
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,760
Just that he's heading back.

766
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,880
His phone's dead.

767
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,560
Now, finish up your food and

768
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,040
then wait for him in the lobby.

769
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,480
If Lan shows up,

770
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,520
let me know.

771
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,720
Zhao Yun, forget the phone calls,

772
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,680
let's hit the streets.

773
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,160
Yeah.

774
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,440
Okay.

775
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,040
We're leaving now,

776
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,400
keep me posted

777
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,240
if he shows up.

778
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,840
Okay.

779
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
Qingtian, forget the food,

780
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,240
hurry to the lobby.

781
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,680
So that if Lan pops up,

782
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
we can inform Ms. Fang right away.

783
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,480
Okay.

784
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
Why hasn't he come back yet?

785
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,080
Xiaohua.

786
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,440
Xiaohua. Qingtian.

787
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,320
What are you guys doing here?

788
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,360
We... Nothing.

789
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,360
Just chatting.

790
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
We're just bored

791
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,880
and taking a stroll around.

792
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,200
Where's Lan?

793
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,280
Isn't he back yet?

794
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
He's out getting something, probably.

795
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,240
Get what?

796
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,200
Where'd he go?

797
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:49,880
He...

798
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,400
I'll go look for him.

799
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,160
Lan is

800
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,400
missing.

801
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,040
What?

802
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,240
Alright.

803
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,760
A special brain-boosting feast

804
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,240
prepared just for you.

805
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,320
Clear Soup Pig Brain.

806
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,720
Scrambled Egg with Pig Brain.

807
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,760
Braised Pig Brain in Soy Sauce.

808
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,560
Boiled Pig Brain.

809
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Charcoal-Grilled Pig Brain.

810
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,560
The pig brain

811
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,840
really messed up my stomach.

812
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,800
Hope it doesn't affect the nerd.

813
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,320
Hey,

814
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,760
how are you feeling after the meal?

815
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,880
I'm fine.

816
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,080
Good then.

817
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,600
Gonna wipe the plate clean.

818
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
Hey guys, let's all perk up

819
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,960
and get ready for the exam.

820
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,560
Mam, my stomach's killing me.

821
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,480
I gotta hit the loo.

822
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,280
Hope it won't

823
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
give him the runs the next day

824
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,680
like what that carp did to me.

825
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,920
Hello, Xiaohua?

826
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,400
It's me.

827
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,000
I gotta tell you something right now,

828
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,800
it's very urgent.
