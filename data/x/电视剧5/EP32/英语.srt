1
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,080
Xiao Hui, have you eaten enough

2
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Eat full

3
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,320
Yeah, and

4
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Don't be nervous about the exam

5
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,800
And

6
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, ID card

7
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
Did you bring your admission ticket?

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Brought it, brought it

9
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,080
Didn't you ask me everything

10
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,040
Is it all morning

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
Why don't you ask me

12
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,840
Head band or not

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,920
Did you bring it

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,560
brought

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,480
Okay, mom

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,720
Don't worry

17
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,680
It's almost time

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,520
Fear of traffic jams on the road

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,280
We started early

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,400
OK

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
Then Grandma, we'll leave first

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,000
Good

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,800
Don't worry, grandma

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,400
OK

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,320
Good

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,760
Refuel

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,240
Refuel

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,840
Let's go bye bye

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,480
Bye

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
This is the street of Lao Ma

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,680
The first rice cake shop

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
The first bowl of rice cakes sold

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
You ate guaranteed high school

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,040
The first bowl

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,320
Mom, do you want to be so exaggerated

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
This is your mother

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,320
Get up at five o'clock in the morning

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,400
I bought it when I went out

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,000
You must eat the college entrance examination today

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,480
Good

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,640
It's a little hot

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll try it too

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,680
Eat it and lose all this luck

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,160
She's the only one who eats it

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
I can't finish it

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
I want you to eat it too

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,640
Dad

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Take a good exam

51
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,840
To grasp the time

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Be sure to examine the questions carefully

53
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,360
Got it

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,480
son

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,600
Refuel

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
Dad believes in you

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,200
Got it

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,360
Don't worry, Dad

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,800
Gone

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,560
Examine the questions carefully and don't worry

61
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Got it, mom

62
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,880
Uncle Lan

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,480
Dongdong sister-in-law

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,040
Let's go inside quickly

65
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,480
Take the exam well, Dongdong, come on

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
Hello Auntie Ma Yiming Hello Uncle

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,240
Get in quickly

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,280
Don't worry, Mom

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,000
Bye

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
You also come to accompany the exam

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,720
Isn't that true

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,480
Yes

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,480
In this life

74
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,360
Just this college entrance examination

75
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,640
No matter how busy you are, you have to come

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
That's that

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
Isn't that Ji-gang

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,480
During the exam

79
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Be sure to be calm

80
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Calmness

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,440
Refuel

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,720
How quickly this time flies

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,240
Okay, Director Zhang

84
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
You said that the hairy boy back then

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Be the director today

86
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,280
That's also a style

87
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
More nervous than the candidates

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
We're nervous too

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm so nervous

90
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,720
Lan Jinghui

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,560
Apprentice Sunny Day

92
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
Came so early

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,200
How about it

94
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
Did you have a good rest last night

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,320
The spirit is quite good

96
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Don't have enough to eat

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,920
Then you have to eat enough

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Are you ready

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm pretty well prepared

100
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,680
Just

101
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,440

Aren't you the same

105
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
Such an important day

106
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,480
Of course it has to be earlier

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Everyone's gathered. Let's go

108
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
Have you seen the monitor

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,480
Is it not there

110
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,920
monitor

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
Don't be nervous on sunny days

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Play well

113
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,800

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,840
Refuel

121
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Refuel

122
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,600
You too

123
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
I'll see you at Beijing University

124
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't worry

125
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,320
The three of us will be fine

126
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,040

Come

130
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,920
Wait a minute

131
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,880
Meng Yu comes over

Chen County will win

136
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
Apprentice Ling Dong

137
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,520
Both of you have finished the exam

138
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,120
How was the exam

139
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
I don't know I didn't think about it

140
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
How can you not think about this

141
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,520
How can this not be known

142
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,560
All the exams are finished

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
What's the use of thinking

144
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,080
How about the Lingdong test

145
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,120
I don't know

146
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,280
I didn't think about it either

147
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,840
Not

148
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,400
Why don't you even think about it

149
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,240
All the exams are finished

150
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,280
What's the use of thinking

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,480
Then let's go

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,880
It's on holiday

153
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,200
Two copies for ten dollars

154
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
Buy one get one free

155
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
Do you want to buy it

156
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,960
Just take a look

157
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,320
The book has its own golden house

158
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,560
Be sure to have a good look

159
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,720
Don't grab it

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,280
It's okay, it's okay

161
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
How's it going

162
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,760
What do you see

163
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,000
We're almost the same

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,720
I also do this

165
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
What about those girls

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
A few old books were grabbed like this

167
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm not this old

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,880
You don't understand this

169
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
In Ling Dong's book

170
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,600
All contaminated is the good luck of Xueba

171
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
It's shallow if you ask me

172
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,960
Have that time to read the notes for a while

173
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Is it bad to do your homework

174
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,160
I agree with you

175
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
Why are you so unlucky

176
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,760
I'll be in line soon

177
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,600
Nothing, nothing

178
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,600
Senior Chen's is still there, let's go

179
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
Welcome Welcome Welcome

180
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Don't worry Don't worry

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
Is there Lan Jinghui

182
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,880
Senior's book

183
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,840
Lan Jinghui

184
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,440
Yeah, I heard he was

185
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Koi fish in our school

186
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
From the bottom of the grade

187
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,640
The last mock test

188
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,240
Improved by 511 places

189
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,440
What is this not a koi fish

190
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
Is that me the last one talking about

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
It's not you, it's me

192
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,240
There's no more

193
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,560
The koi fish is here. Come on, come on, come on

194
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Over there, over there

195
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,640
Everyone has it

197
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,240
Everyone has it

198
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Upperclassman

199
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Can you sign my dress

200
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,680
I'm going to wear it for the college entrance examination

201
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,240
Senior Koi

202
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
Can I take a picture of your head

203
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,440
I want to make a good jackpot

204
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,080
Senior Koi

205
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,960
Can I take a group photo

206
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
I want to use it as a screensaver for my mobile phone

207
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,880
Senior Koi

208
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I want to be a cell phone ringtone

209
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,120
Senior Senior

210
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,240
Senior Senior Senior

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,880
He is the first in his grade

212
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
Look for him, look for him, look for him

213
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,600
Yes, yes, yes

214
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,520
The same is true for Senior Ling Dong

215
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,720
Are these all yours

216
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,600
Sister Dream

217
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,880
Xu Mengyu

218
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
Wrap it all up for me, I'll take it

219
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,960
Are you sure

220
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Why don't you give it to me

221
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,720
Not

222
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
What do you want these for

223
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
They're all basketball jerseys and stuff

224
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,320
You had three times in total

225
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
Call me by my full name

226
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
The first time I was caught copying

227
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
You came to my house to find me

228
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,200
The second time was by the lake

229
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,400
When looking at the stars

230
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
The third time was just now

231
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,120
You remember these

232
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,520
Why do you remember so clearly

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,160
Actually, these things

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,640
In the eyes of others

235
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,880
Probably just a bunch of junk

236
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
But in my eyes

237
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,720
Everything here

238
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
They were all with you

239
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,040
Pursue Dreams

240
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,120
It's all in your youth

241
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,360
The best memories

242
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,760
I think

243
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,160
It's quite collectible

244
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,640
Maybe it will be fine in the future

245
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
As the material of my writing

246
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
Just tell you whether to give it or not

247
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,280
Give Give Give

248
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,560
But you have to keep it safe for me

249
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm gonna be

250
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Chinese football king's

251
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,400
OK

252
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
Then please help me pack it

253
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,640
Good

254
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,640
Go ahead

255
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,320
Why did you call me over

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,280
This is for you on sunny days

257
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,680
What's wrong

258
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,280
You're not the favorite

259
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,960
Is this a taste

260
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,480
It's really my favorite flavor

261
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,640
But I just feel strange

262
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,360
Why do you buy milk tea every time

263
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,160
Always available

264
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,960
My favorite flavor

265
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,160
And

266
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
Why did you suddenly follow me

267
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,400
Appear in the same cram school

268
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
These aren't coincidences, are they

269
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,880
I know

270
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
You don't even live near my house

271
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,840
I also know

272
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,000
Every time you take me home

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,240
It's not a smooth road at all

274
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,640
But you still do

275
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,760
Send me home every time

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,760
Why on earth is this

277
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,240
Don't tell me, right

278
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,800
Then there were two juniors just now

279
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,840
Send me two friendship letters

280
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
Should I go back and take it apart

281
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,960
No dismantling is allowed

282
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Why

283
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,960
Clear day

284
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Don't you really remember me

285
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
Actually, we've known each other a long time ago

286
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,040
Still remember Xiaoshengchu

287
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,280
That summer summer

288
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,880
You're in an alley

289
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,680
Helped someone who was thin and didn't pull much

290
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,920
The bullied little boy

291
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,120
That little boy is me

292
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,000
You were like a

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,920
Appear like a heroine

294
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,800
So cool

295
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,120
Get a shout

296
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Scared them all away

297
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,240
That's because I have a loud voice

298
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
They're afraid I'll call someone

299
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
Actually

300
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,640
As soon as I heard your voice

301
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,760
I recognized you

302
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,880
Thank you for that day

303
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,840
Everything done for me

304
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,520
So I decided

305
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,040
Whenever you need help

306
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I must be by your side

307
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,800
Didn't you tell me earlier

308
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,400
So you are

309
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,680
To repay me

310
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,640
Then I have a loud voice

311
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Have helped more people

312
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,200
How can I remember

313
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
Actually, a lollipop

314
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,200
Something that can be solved

315
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,680
This is

316
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,720
This is the lollipop you gave me

317
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,360
I saved it all

318
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,560
What are you doing

319
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,320
I like you

320
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,680
Come and see if it looks good

321
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,480
Do not throw the leakage

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,520
Definitely not me and sunny days

323
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
That one looks good

324
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,480
That's necessary

325
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,600
This is good

326
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
Dear senior high school graduates

327
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
It's about to start

328
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
Taking graduation photos

329
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,800
Taken graduation photos

330
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,440
Then let's go

331
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,600
Go, go, go, go, go

332
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Good teachers and students

333
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
Everyone, look at my camera

334
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,480
Don't blink when shooting

335
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,960
Good come

336
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,480
Come on, everyone, keep your backs straight

337
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,280
One Two Three

338
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,680
Why don't you two show off at all

339
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,200
scheming

340
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,960
What are you two doing

341
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,920
The scheming is really

342
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Have a good one

343
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,640
Come, come, come, start over

344
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,640
The ugliest must be the ugliest

345
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,280
It's okay, you don't have to move, you're ugly

346
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
You you you

347
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,600
Come on, come on, come on

348
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,880
Come on, come on, three, two, one

349
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,880
And at the end there is one more

350
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,160
Long live graduation

351
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,160
Long live graduation

352
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,320
It's finally over

353
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,200
His face stiffened with laughter

354
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,040
That's the end

355
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,000
It seems that there is something wrong

356
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,640
Then do you want to give it to Chen County

357
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,120
Leave some last souvenir

358
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,600
What are you trying to do

359
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,680
Squad, follow me

360
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,960
Walk, walk, walk

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,360
Go

362
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,800
Open the door

363
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,760
Open the door, open the door

364
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,440
Junior brothers and sisters

365
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
Today we are about to graduate

366
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
But your journey

367
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,960
It's just beginning

368
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,800
Here it is

369
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,360
We have a few words

370
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,240
I want to tell you

371
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
dejected

372
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,160
It's not our Chenjun style

373
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,280
Flying against the wind can create miracles

374
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,600
Don't fear failure

375
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,640
Don't be afraid to be alone

376
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,000
Because what you're going through

377
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,320
There are countless people

378
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,680
Already experienced

379
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,600
So it's not a big deal

380
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,640
Don't care what others say

381
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,920
It's enough to walk your own way

382
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
There is no shortcut to success

383
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
Only by redoubling the effort

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,360
can be obtained

385
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,200
No matter how tired you are from studying, you have to eat well

386
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
Cherish a section

387
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,800
A time that will never be repeated

388
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,760
Be sure to cherish it

389
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,320
The people around you

390
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,960
Youth without regrets

391
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,280
As long as you work hard, you won't regret it

392
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,640
Youth without regrets

393
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,920
As long as you work hard, you won't regret it

394
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,640
Come on, you guys are the best

395
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
College entrance examination means

396
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,360
The End of High School

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,040
But my youth

398
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,360
Because I met you guys

399
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,920
To become different

400
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
Some people don't matter how hard they fall

401
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,720
All have the courage to start over

402
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,680
Some people will do it for you

403
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
Be an enemy of the whole world

404
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,360
Some people will share it with you

405
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
All the joys and sorrows

406
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,600
Some people pass you by

407
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
All with caution

408
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,600
Some people will untie it for you

409
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,720
every puzzle

410
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,760
Some people will help you block it

411
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,640
All the malice

412
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,640
I've been meeting

413
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,800
Different lovely and kind people

414
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
And then reluctant to separate from them

415
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
I sent out a lot of

416
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,560
A serious voice

417
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
Also got a lot

418
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,040
A sincere response

419
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
The stories that happened

420
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,360
People I've met

421
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,280
Will be engraved in

422
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,880
In the hearts of each of us

423
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,680
Never End

424
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,440
Doudou, you want to know too

425
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,520
My sister's grades

426
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,760
Aren't you curious

427
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,440
Anyway, in a few hours

428
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,760
The results are about to come out

429
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
Regardless of the outcome

430
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,800
I will insist

431
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
The path I chose

432
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,840
Doesn't make sense to the answer

433
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,120
You're the same as before

434
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,880
Is that Xiao Xiaohua

435
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,880
Is better

436
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,600
Xiao Xiaohua

437
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,640
Hello

438
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Come on down. We're both here

439
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,880
Do you think my apprentice is she

440
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,200
Dare not check the results alone

441
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,560
So ask us both to be courageous

442
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,440
You're not much better, are you

443
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,800
What's wrong with me

444
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Then what are you shaking

445
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,200
I said

446
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,760
Do you need to be so nervous

447
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,760
Can you not be nervous

448
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,880
I've grown so big

449
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
I've never been so serious

450
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,680
I studied for more than a year

451
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,040
If you don't do well in the exam

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,120
All the exams are finished

453
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,560
Whether you are nervous or not, the results are there

454
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,760
Don't think so much

455
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,880
You just look at other people's small paintings

456
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,920
What a good attitude

457
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,800
You're not looking for both of us

458
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,840
Come and check your results with you

459
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,560
That

460
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,880
Then why are you looking for us

461
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,800
Three years of high school

462
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,840
I have a regret

463
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,280
Could have been done

464
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
If you want to blame, blame this Lan Jinghui

465
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,560
No sense of responsibility

466
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
What does it have to do with me

467
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,080
The first day we met

468
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
Didn't you just say you wanted to teach me

469
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,040
Do you ride a bicycle

470
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,040
I can buy the car now

471
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,960
That's all

472
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,880
No problem

473
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,240
In the past two years, Master

474
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,920
I made you deserve your name

475
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,360
Go

476
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,080
Have you noticed

477
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
This road looks better than it used to be

478
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,320
It's been three years since I've been gone

479
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
You just found out now

480
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,000
How do I feel

481
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Nothing has changed at all

482
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,200
I used to walk every day

483
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,240
When this road

484
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,760
Not in a hurry to school

485
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,200
Just running home

486
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
Haven't even looked at this road carefully

487
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,320
High school went by so quickly

488
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,160
From now on, the three of us

489
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,960
There may be few opportunities

490
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,000
Walking this path together like this

491
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,680
Do you remember the first time we

492
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,280
When we met over there

493
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,320
I remember, of course I remember

494
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,560
Right at that intersection

495
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,280
Fortunately, I called the police that time

496
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,520
Otherwise, this kid might

497
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,160
I got into a fight with the driver

498
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,760
Maybe you'll be dropped out of school

499
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,120
Do you think I saved you

500
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,480
You listen to the apprentice

501
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,240
How bad was this man at the time

502
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
He had clearly seen it

503
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,640
There's a camera there

504
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,880
And the police have been called

505
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,160
He doesn't tell us either

506
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,440
Let us both stay where we are

507
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,480
It really is

508
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,680
If I hadn't influenced you

509
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,400
To have what you are now

510
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,240
Is it human-like

511
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
What do you mean you influence me

512
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Find out that I saved you

513
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,920
A cold and heartless man like you

514
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,720
A selfish person

515
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,960
If I hadn't been friends with you

516
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
Who's gonna be your friend

517
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,840
Then who is in two years

518
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
painstakingly

519
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,760
Put sb. 's academic achievements

520
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,000
Little by little upgraded

521
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,200
That's because I've been smart since I was a kid

522
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,920
Talented and intelligent

523
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,120
All right, all right, all right

524
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
Think about it this way

525
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,680
We were at that time

526
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,520
It's pretty funny

527
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,280
I think the funniest

528
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,360
It must have been that time

529
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,120
A Spider-Man fell from the sky

530
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,840
Too funny

531
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,480
You guys look funny

532
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,400
I've had a backache for several days

533
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,480
It really hurts

534
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,160
But thinking about it this way

535
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
There is still a regret left in high school

536
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
I haven't found it till now

537
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,040
The person who exchanged my letter

538
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,840
Congratulations

539
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,600
No regrets now

540
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,760
It's you

541
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,400
Surprised or not surprised or not surprised

542
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm telling you it's impossible

543
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,000
Because I was

544
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,880
I compared your notes

545
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,880
I'll just say you're a big fool

546
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,680
I wrote it with my left hand

547
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,120
Do you think you are

548
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,720
It turns out that the letter

549
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,960
Really at your place

550
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

551
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,520
Doesn't there be another one

552
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Someone who admires me

553
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,960
It's me

554
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,880
You wrote it to me

555
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,000
I wrote it to Ling Dong

556
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,440
Okay, Xiao Xiaohua

557
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,520
Since the first day of school, you've been

558
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,400
All right, all right, all right

559
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,400
Didn't you say

560
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,040
Will you teach me to ride a bike

561
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
This is almost the finale

562
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,120
You still don't teach

563
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,280
Who told you about the finale

564
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,840
There's more in the back. Get in the car

565
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,680
Come on

566
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,640
Come and help me

567
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,800
Three, two, one go

568
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,520
Go ahead

569
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,440
Go ahead

570
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
Please keep up the good work

571
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,800
Looking back on this youth

572
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,080
proud

573
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Not one by one

574
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,440
Letter of admission

575
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,200
But the one who goes all out

576
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,800
Self who never gave up

577
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,360
And those

578
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,120
The teenager who accompanied him

579
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,080
With the greenest appearance

580
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,600
Walked through together

581
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,800
The best time

582
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,600
Got it

583
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,520
I'm sorry I'm late

584
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
Keep you waiting so long

585
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,920
It doesn't matter. I just arrived, too

586
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,880
Do you know how far it is

587
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,760
I changed the subway twice before I got there

588
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,600
Give

589
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,040
Thank you

590
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,880
I haven't finished

591
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,960
You know the subway today

592
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
How crowded is it

593
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,760
My makeup is squeezed out

594
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Look at my acne

595
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,000
No, I have to make up my mind quickly

596
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Help me get it

597
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,720
Higher

598
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:53,960
How about it

599
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,360
perfect

600
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:01,880
What's wrong

601
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,920
I'd like to try your cup of milk tea

602
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:12,920
Let's go

603
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,280
hair

604
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,560
What's wrong

605
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,120
It's stuck to the neck

606
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,280
Ma Yiming

607
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,200
Ma YimingXu Mengyu

608
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,360
Why are you still late

609
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,680
I'm a junior

610
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm not even late

611
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,920
You guys are behind us

612
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,240
Ma Yiming

613
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,760
You are admitted to Chengdu University after repeating your studies for one year

614
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
I have the confidence to speak

615
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,920
Of course

616
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,560
I'm a serious college student now

617
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,320
Summer sunny day

618
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,160
I didn't expect everyone to go to college

619
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,400
You still love to eat so much

620
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,600
You take care of me

621
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,520
This is my lifelong pursuit

622
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,760
Let's go, let's go

623
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,520
Let's go in quickly

624
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:53,960
Good

625
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,160
Don't go after her

626
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,600
If you pursue it again, you're just like her

627
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,960
You roll the horse and cry, you shut up, you

628
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,200
You guys are here

629
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,760
Small painting

630
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,240
Awesome!

631
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,600
It's all right to hold a solo exhibition

632
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,760
Where is there

633
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,080
Okay, we went over and looked at it

634
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,720
OK OK

635
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,360
Bye bye bye bye

636
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,760
Bye

637
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,600
Xiao Xiaohua

638
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,280
Li Ruosi

639
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,560
You guys, you guys actually

640
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Congratulations, congratulations

641
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Not bad Not bad

642
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,280
Walk, walk, walk

643
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,440
We went over to have a look

644
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,200
OK OK

645
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,480
Is it not finished

646
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,000
Come on, come on, come on

647
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Small painting

648
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,440
Isn't it okay to say a few words

649
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,200
You're insulting me

650
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,600
Why are you here

651
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,800
Xiaohua, congratulations

652
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,800
I didn't think you were really here

653
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,480
Had an exhibition of paintings

654
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,760
Congratulations to you too

655
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,720
A new book has been published

656
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm yours now

657
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,160
A loyal book fan

658
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,800
Really

659
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,400
Of course

660
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,760
Our senior sister now

661
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,240
First Young Author

662
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,440
Stop blowing rainbow farts, okay

663
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,120
Where are Lan Jinghui and Ling Dong?

664
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,920
Both of them

665
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,080
Didn't I come with you

666
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,440
Haven't they come yet

667
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,160
I thought they were all here

668
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,760
The little paintings are all ready

669
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,520
It's ready to start

670
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,920
Okay, I'll be right there

671
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,440
OK

672
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Today is such an important occasion

673
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,600
Both of them are still late

674
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Why don't you wait for Xiaohua

675
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,640
Go ahead

676
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,640
Good

677
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:21,960
Help you sort it out

678
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,880
Thank you all

679
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,360
Come over to my exhibition

680
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,760
This exhibition

681
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,680
I named it Mustard Seed Time

682
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,600
To record the history of my life

683
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,840
The most important journey

684
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Whenever I feel confused and confused

685
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
When you are stagnant

686
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,840
can draw strength from it

687
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,560
Because cherish

688
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
So I record it with a paintbrush

689
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,400
The school playground

690
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,960
Sycamore trees along a tree-lined road

691
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Endless homework

692
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,080
And a smiling face that I can't get tired of watching

693
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,680
And

694
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,680
A boy in white riding a bicycle

695
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,520
Thank you for this journey

696
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,320
Those people who walked with me

697
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,840
It is precisely because of them

698
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,800
That's what makes me this little time

699
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Emitting an eternal glimmer of light

700
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,840
Good

701
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,040
Awesome!

702
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,280
Just two days ago, my country's first batch

703
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,240
Manned spacecraft Tianwen-7

704
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,440
Successfully landed on Mars

705
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,760
This successful landing

706
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,840
For my country's aerospace history

707
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,360
Has great historical significance

708
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,720
Let's connect

709
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,040
Two astronauts

710
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,680
Hello everyone

711
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,200
I'm Astronaut No. 1 Lan Jinghui

712
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,480
Hello everyone

713
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm Astronaut No. 2 Ling Dong

714
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,400
What about now

715
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,440
It's Beijing time on Earth

716
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,720
Three fifteen o'clock

717
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
We offer to our fellow citizens on earth

718
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,200
Send a greeting

719
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,480
Hello everyone

720
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,960
Today is our high school classmates

721
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,480
Xiao Xiaohua's painting exhibition

722
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,320
Unfortunately

723
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,480
We can't get to the scene in person

724
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,160
But it's okay

725
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,840
We're in space

726
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,040
Send her a greeting

727
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,640
I wish her every success

728
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,680
The exhibition was a complete success

729
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,840
You can see

730
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,360
Where are we now

731
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,000
In the boundless universe

732
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,200
Make an interstellar travel

733
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
The landscape in front of us

734
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,760
It's really beautiful

735
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,800
Very beautiful

736
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,120
People can't help but sigh again and again

737
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,360
The uncanny workmanship of nature

738
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,920
and human

739
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
Smallness in the vast universe

740
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,160
Small indeed

741
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,520
Very small

742
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,160
Is that the word I just did

743
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,720
Did we say something wrong

744
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,880
Did I steal your word

745
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,440
It's not that I remember what you said

746
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,480
That's what I said

747
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,680
Give me a look at the manuscript

748
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,400
Script Take a look at the script

749
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,360
I'm

750
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,800
Here

751
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,040
Yes indeed

752
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,280
Look, go from here

753
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
You said it was indeed small

754
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,360
I should say one more thing

755
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,960
Is it not

756
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,680
Lan Jing Hui Ling Dong

757
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,800
You two come out of here

758
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,440
Here it is

759
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,840
May I ask you two at my exhibition

760
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,080
What the hell is it

761
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Not the two of us

762
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,000
It was his idea

763
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,000
He thinks your exhibition

764
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,560
Should have some cosmic vibe

765
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,560
This isn't to give you

766
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,560
Are you preparing a little surprise

767
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,320
You call this a surprise

768
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,240
Apprentice, do you feel

769
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,000
After watching this video

770
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,680
The entire exhibition

771
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,520
Become a little more high-end

772
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,000
And the style

773
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,800
It came up at once

774
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,560
Then you tell me

775
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,360
Where is it high-end

776
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,200
Where is the style upgrade

777
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,080
This is human

778
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,320
From interstellar travel

779
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,480
Congratulatory message sent back

780
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,600
The only one in the world

781
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,400
Then I'll send you two back now

782
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,680
Is it too late

783
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,000
Ling Dong, you actually

784
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,840
And fooling around with him
