1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,080
Bright Time EP08

3
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,400
Seriously, you two crossed a line

4
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
practicing behind our backs.

5
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,400
What's the deal?

6
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Trying to steal my thunder

7
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,960
at the talent show?

8
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
But that song

9
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
was actually good.

10
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,600
How about

11
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,720
we practice that song?

12
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,960
Make a change again?

13
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,640
Are you kidding?

14
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
We've been rehearsing for long!

15
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
What's your opinion, then?

16
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's do it!

17
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,400
C'mon!

18
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Our competitors seem strong, huh?

19
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,280
Their outfits look great too.

20
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,120
I think ours

21
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
are nice too, right?

22
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,960
We shouldn't let others shine while

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
we fade into the background.

24
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,520
Where's Ling Dong?

25
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,360
Any sign of him?

26
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,360
I don't know where he is.

27
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,600
I haven't seen him around.

28
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
Well, call him quickly.

29
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
I just tried calling him,

30
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
but no answer.

31
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,880
Everyone here now?

32
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,480
Hi, Ms. Fang.

33
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,160
How's the prep going?

34
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,440
Where's Ling Dong?

35
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,560
He hasn't shown up yet.

36
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
What?

37
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,840
No worries,

38
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,840
He won't drop the ball

39
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,120
when it counts.

40
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,200
Attention!

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,760
The competition is about to kick off.

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,480
Get ready! Keep it up!

43
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,640
What now?

44
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,120
Stay calm.

45
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Ma Yiming,

46
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,520
go wait at the door.

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
Bring Ling Dong straight here

48
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,480
when he arrives.

49
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,880
All right.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
I'll go with you.

51
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,400
Let's go.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,360
Esteemed leaders,

53
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,920
honored guests,

54
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,760
dear teachers, and fellow students,

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,960
good afternoon.

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,240
Welcome to the 13th

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,720
Annual City High School Talent Show.

58
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
On behalf of the organizers,

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,160
I'd like to extend a warm welcome

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,400
and heartfelt thanks

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
to all of you.

62
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm pleased to announce

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,200
the official start

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
of the Talent Show

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
now!

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,080
How did it go?

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Waited at the door for half an hour,

68
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
still no sign of him.

69
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
Chenjun High School, right?

70
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,120
You're next.

71
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
Get ready to wait in the wings.

72
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
But our team isn't all here yet.

73
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,240
Can we

74
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
go later, please?

75
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
The order is fixed.

76
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
If you want to switch,

77
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
you need to negotiate with other teams.

78
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
Okay. I'll go negotiate.

79
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,400
You guys get ready.

80
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,880
Xiangbei First High School, get ready.

81
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,800
♪Out the side of road shelter,♪

82
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,600
♪grasses are green and wild.♪

83
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,000
It's quite a visual feast, isn't it?

84
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,840
Up next, I believe the performance

85
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
will take us into

86
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,160
a different realm of art.

87
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,880
Now, please enjoy

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
the accordion solo

89
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
by Junde First High School,

90
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,400
"Lifting Your Spirits".

91
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,000
What do we do?

92
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,400
Ms. Fang managed

93
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
to push us to last,

94
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,880
but...

95
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,560
Let's improvise.

96
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,960
Ling Dong?

97
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,200
Why are you so late?

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,120
Sorry,

99
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,920
got held up with something.

100
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,440
Your face... What happened?

101
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
Let me get you a band-aid.

102
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,520
No need.

103
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,880
It's urgent.

104
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,240
Let's prepare first.

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,840
Jinghui, someone's watching us.

106
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,440
Let's perform first.

107
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,360
We'll settle scores later.

108
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,520
Let's go!

109
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,120
Thanks to Junde First High School

110
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
for the brilliant performance.

111
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,320
Youthful vigor, scholarly spirit,

112
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,880
and commanding presence.

113
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,080
Youth is a word

114
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,800
that just hearing it makes one

115
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,160
feel clean and beautiful.

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,160
Next, please enjoy

117
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,400
the band performance of Bright Time

118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,880
by Chenjun High School.

119
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,440
Please!

120
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,680
What's going on?

121
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,600
The lights went out.

122
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,240
It's our Chenjun High School's doing.

123
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Until this moment,

124
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,240
I truly believe for the first time

125
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,960
that unstoppable passion and

126
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
determination for continuous improvement

127
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,400
can eventually create miracles.

128
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,400
Cheers!

129
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,280
Celebrating our rooftop squad's

130
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,200
successful performance!

131
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,600
Congrats to Xiao Xiaohua

132
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,200
for winning the Best Creativity Award

133
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,280
at the Talent Show!

134
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,840
Xiao Xiaohua,

135
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,760
you were amazing today!

136
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,800
Not a single note was off.

137
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
All thanks to Lan Jinghui

138
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,440
for correcting my pitch so well.

139
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,680
These were just minor issues.

140
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,480
We almost messed up today

141
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
because of someone.

142
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,360
I'm sorry,

143
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,240
I didn't mean to be late today.

144
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,000
Then why didn't you

145
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,600
pick up my call?

146
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,520
What happened?

147
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,280
Accidentally dropped it. It's fine.

148
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,720
Ling Dong definitely

149
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,520
didn't mean to be late.

150
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,480
He must have been

151
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,840
delayed on the way.

152
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,600
Wait...

153
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,760
Stop talking about it.

154
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,120
Let's eat before it gets cold.

155
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,440
But he...

156
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
Lan Jinghui, have your food.

157
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,200
You deserve the most credit.

158
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,720
He did a lot.

159
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
I did my part too,

160
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,520
right?

161
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,440
Jinghui,

162
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,120
you still haven't done

163
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,680
what you promised me earlier.

164
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,080
I've been busy

165
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,760
teaching someone guitar

166
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,800
these days.

167
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,160
I promise,

168
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,400
I'll sort it out tomorrow.

169
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,040
This is delicious.

170
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,080
Lan Jinghui,

171
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,280
why do you do that gesture

172
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,800
with your pinky on top?

173
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,920
Can't anyone do that?

174
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,880
My pinky can only go below.

175
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,200
So can mine.

176
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,960
Wait...

177
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
I can do it since I was little.

178
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,960
Stop focusing on this weird detail.

179
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,920
Let's eat.

180
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,560
Enjoy it.

181
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,520
One more time.

182
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,600
Cheers!

183
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,720
The Best Creative Award

184
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
of Xiangbei City Talent Show!

185
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,120
That's really amazing!

186
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Baby, you've never

187
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
won an award before,

188
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,040
and now you've snagged

189
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,280
such a great one!

190
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,760
Incredible!

191
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,120
My daughter is on fire!

192
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,800
You've outdone your old man!

193
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,040
Where should we put it?

194
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,440
Where?

195
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,240
How about

196
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,080
the balcony?

197
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,040
Yes, the balcony.

198
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,280
No, no, it's not grand enough.

199
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,800
It deserves something

200
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,440
more prestigious.

201
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,400
How about

202
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,960
the art room?

203
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,360
Great,

204
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,320
good idea.

205
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
But... it's not your award,

206
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,360
why put it in the art room?

207
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,080
Then...

208
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,600
how about...

209
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,200
our daughter's bedroom?

210
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,760
That's cool!

211
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,920
No,

212
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,680
it's a private room.

213
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,760
The trophy should be placed

214
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,880
somewhere everyone can see it.

215
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,360
The dining room, okay?

216
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,080
Fancy!

217
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
Morning. You're Xiao Xiaohua, right?

218
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,560
See you.

219
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,080
Xiaohua, I really admire you.

220
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,840
Morning, Xiaohua.

221
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
Keep it up, Xiaohua.

222
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,440
Go, Xiaohua!

223
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,160
Xiaohua, keep it up.

224
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Xiaohua, your video was awesome.

225
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,240
Saw your video, Xiaohua.

226
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,120
Keep pushing, Xiaohua.

227
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,560
Xiaohua, you sang amazingly.

228
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,080
Xiaohua.

229
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
She's something else.

230
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,000
Xiaohua,

231
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,520
seriously, you're incredibly talented.

232
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,720
Loved your video.

233
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,280
Xiaohua.

234
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,720
Qingtian,

235
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,160
it's so weird.

236
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
When I walked into school,

237
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,960
tons of people I don't know

238
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,880
greeted me,

239
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,000
totally freaked me out.

240
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,360
That's a good thing.

241
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,760
It means you're really popular now.

242
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
But I'm still not used to it.

243
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,480
No worries.

244
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,120
You just need time.

245
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,800
Xu Mengyu is over there.

246
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,160
No, I mean,

247
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,040
where's Xiao Xiaohua?

248
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,480
Xiao Xiaohua,

249
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,680
someone's looking for you.

250
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
Your performance was stellar.

251
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,800
No... it's epic!

252
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,080
Here, take this.

253
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,960
Hope we can be friends.

254
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,880
Sure, thanks.

255
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,960
Don't forget to read the letter.

256
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,880
Xiaohua,

257
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
you're practically a celebrity now,

258
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,240
even have fans

259
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
sending you letters.

260
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,120
It's just a competition.

261
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,840
So what?

262
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,720
What's the big deal?

263
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,440
Liu Shu,

264
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,080
if you're jealous, just say it.

265
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,520
Why beat around the bush?

266
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,320
Jealous?

267
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,120
Mengyu didn't make

268
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,920
such a big fuss

269
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
when she competed last year, did she?

270
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,160
Stop there.

271
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,520
We need to go to the biology lab.

272
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,320
What was that?

273
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,560
She was green with envy.

274
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,480
I've been waiting for you forever.

275
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,520
Lan Jinghui,

276
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,200
not only are you

277
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,520
the last in your grade,

278
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,520
but the last in the entire school.

279
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,840
Winning that award get to your head?

280
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,480
No way,

281
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,160
how could I?

282
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,720
Serious now.

283
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,400
Why were you late?

284
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,760
Overslept.

285
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,320
Seriously.

286
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,240
Look at the dark shadows under my eyes.

287
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,880
Sleep-deprived?

288
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,080
Go home and catch up on sleep.

289
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,120
Good morning, Mr. Zhang.

290
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,400
How come...

291
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,080
you're late too?

292
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,200
Something wrong with my bicycle.

293
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,720
What happened to your face?

294
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
Bumped into something. It's fine.

295
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,400
Get to class.

296
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,560
See you later.

297
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,520
Ling Dong,

298
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,520
be more careful riding your bike.

299
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
Thank you. Bye.

300
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:00,920
Sir,

301
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
you actually believe such a lame excuse?

302
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,120
But what I just told you

303
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,440
is the truth...

304
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,600
Why aren't you home yet?

305
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,080
Get to class.

306
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,760
Now!

307
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,120
All right,

308
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,520
thanks.

309
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,080
Our main task

310
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,240
today

311
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,520
is to work on these onions.

312
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
The experiment topic

313
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
is crude extraction of DNA.

314
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,600
Pair up freely

315
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,160
with one for the experiment,

316
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,720
and the other for records.

317
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
Onions can be quite irritating,

318
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,400
so,

319
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
you're provided with

320
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,720
goggles and gloves.

321
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Clear so far?

322
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,560
Crystal clear.

323
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,080
Sorry,

324
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,960
teacher,

325
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm late.

326
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,880
Be on time next time.

327
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,320
Chenjun's Light reporting in.

328
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
Lan Jinghui! Stop!

329
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,720
Wanna be expelled?

330
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
No, no.

331
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,680
Go join Ling Dong's group.

332
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,240
Jinghui,

333
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,800
where are my new shoes?

334
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Right on your seat.

335
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,160
If you have any questions, just ask me.

336
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,080
Extracting and identifying DNA?

337
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,640
Are we really doing such

338
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
advanced experiments at this stage?

339
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,960
Is it in the textbook?

340
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,280
I've got it covered, no worries.

341
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,160
Just don't

342
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,120
end up not knowing

343
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,520
what to do later.

344
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,680
Too much...

345
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,080
No, too little now.

346
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,320
Mengyu,

347
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,000
the onions are all sliced for you.

348
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
Are you moved or something?

349
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,280
C'mon, they're pungent!

350
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,160
Quit staring and start recording.

351
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,920
Come over here.

352
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,960
What for?

353
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,680
I'm no good at this, don't rely on me.

354
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,960
Help me take off my goggles.

355
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,840
I've got something on my hands.

356
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,960
You're quite demanding, you know?

357
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,320
Put on.

358
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,080
Why?

359
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,240
I want my experiment notes

360
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,200
to be more precise,

361
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,520
okay?

362
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,640
I can record accurately

363
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,880
even with my eyes closed.

364
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,320
Then keep writing:

365
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,080
filter the mixture

366
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,520
through two layers of gauze,

367
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,560
then add the precipitated solution

368
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,480
to 10 milliliters pre-chilled

369
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,200
ethanol solution,

370
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280
and let it sit.

371
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,400
How'd you get that mark on your face?

372
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,160
Listen, let it sit.

373
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,120
Note it down.

374
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,960
How are you handling this?

375
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,400
Wow, Ling Dong,

376
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,240
impressive speed

377
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,800
and accuracy.

378
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,000
Ash Lan,

379
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
you've lucked out with an ace teammate.

380
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
You're practically coasting.

381
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
Coasting?

382
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,800
I'm just as much a part of this team

383
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,960
as anyone.

384
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,000
No coasting

385
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,560
without

386
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,600
thorough notes,

387
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,640
got it?

388
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,360
Are you done writing?

389
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,600
Get lost.

390
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,280
You guys distracted me and I forgot.

391
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,000
Hurry up and leave.

392
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,720
Why so grouchy? No fun at all.

393
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
How about I handle the procedure

394
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,040
and you do the recording?

395
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,440
Okay.

396
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,520
Qingtian, it's torn.

397
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
Each group only has one pair of gloves.

398
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,800
What now?

399
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,240
Qingtian, take mine.

400
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,800
Then what will you use?

401
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,080
Don't worry about me.

402
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,760
Thank you.

403
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,400
She's my seatmate.

404
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
What are you doing?

405
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,520
Just something a monitor should do.

406
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,000
Jinghui,

407
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,520
where's my gift?

408
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,240
On your desk. Check it out yourself.

409
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,840
An "A", a "J",

410
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,640
and a coconut for you.

411
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,080
Jinghui!

412
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,960
It's time for class!

413
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,040
Lan Jinghui, Ma Yiming,

414
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,200
what are you two doing?

415
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,080
Jogging.

416
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,160
Get ready for class!

417
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,760
Class begins!

418
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,800
Here.

419
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Stand up.

420
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,880
Hello, teacher.

421
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,520
Please take your seats.

422
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,360
Everyone,

423
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,480
the mid-term exam

424
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,200
is coming up soon.

425
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,120
I hope

426
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,200
you'll take it seriously.

427
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
You start howling

428
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
as soon as you hear it.

429
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,200
Are you nervous?

430
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,640
Yeah.

431
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,160
Some of you are usually

432
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,120
late for class, sleeping,

433
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,840
or not submitting homework.

434
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,360
From what I see,

435
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,240
you all seem quite relaxed.

436
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,200
Ma'am,

437
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,880
you've misunderstood.

438
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,840
We actually study hard in private.

439
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,600
Am I right, Lan Jinghui?

440
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,240
Yes.

441
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,400
Are you serious?

442
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:45,960
Yes, we are.

443
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,800
Words are cheap.

444
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,080
We'll see the results.

445
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,760
Especially Ma Yiming

446
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,800
and Lan Jinghui.

447
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,240
I'll keep a close eye

448
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,560
on both of you.

449
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,960
Ma'am, I haven't done anything.

450
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,400
This is all a misunderstanding.

451
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,920
Misunderstanding or not,

452
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,680
when you two stop

453
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,360
being at the bottom,

454
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,400
I'll shift my focus.

455
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,240
Okay, let's start the class.

456
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,880
Today, you'll learn

457
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,240
about sequences.

458
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,480
What are you laughing at?

459
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,160
Let me tell you,

460
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,680
this kind of

461
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,160
mid-term exam

462
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,960
will be a pushover.

463
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,400
I'm not worried about you.

464
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,080
Conservatively speaking,

465
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,880
without any surprise,

466
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,280
you'll move up a hundred places.

467
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,680
You have that much confidence in me?

468
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,560
Nope,

469
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
it's confidence in myself.

470
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,160
Ma Yiming, go play basketball with me.

471
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,240
No.

472
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,320
How about it?

473
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
The coconut I gave you isn't bad, right?

474
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,800
Take it back. I don't want it.

475
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,040
I have a question for you.

476
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,320
See any injury on Ling Dong's face?

477
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,400
No, I didn't.

478
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,240
Are your eyes

479
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,520
just for show?

480
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm... a man,

481
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,720
why would I stare at him all day?

482
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,120
Can't I look at my Mengyu instead?

483
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,040
Besides,

484
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,440
something's off about you.

485
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,000
Are you trying to mess with him again?

486
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,760
I'm talking seriously here.

487
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,760
Maybe he bumped into something himself.

488
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,400
Doesn't seem like it.

489
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,080
If so,

490
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,680
there would be bruises.

491
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,040
He scratched himself with his own nails.

492
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,480
Not possible.

493
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,400
He doesn't have nails.

494
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,120
How could he scratch himself?

495
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Jinghui, I really don't know.

496
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm not a forensic doctor.

497
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,560
Why are you telling me these?

498
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,120
The most crucial point is...

499
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,520
he was late this morning.

500
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,000
Have you ever seen such a thing happen?

501
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,840
No.

502
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
Now that you mention it,

503
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,200
something does seem off.

504
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,000
Right!

505
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,080
Did he get into trouble outside

506
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
and someone beat him up?

507
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,080
I mean, got beaten up.

508
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,400
Was he beaten up?

509
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,800
That was a good performance.

510
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,800
Thanks.

511
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,720
Does my son's composition sound good?

512
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,280
Ling Dong also participated in.

513
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,960
But most of it was done by my son.

514
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,200
He learned guitar

515
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,080
from my son.

516
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,960
Alright. You're impressive,

517
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,480
and the best in the world.

518
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,600
You just wanna hear me say

519
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
that like a father, like a son, right?

520
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,600
He doesn't quite match up

521
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,320
to me back in the day.

522
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,000
Does he know

523
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
our relationship now?

524
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,360
Don't tell him, though.

525
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,800
Otherwise, he'll be rebellious

526
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,520
at school.

527
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,720
I think he's just

528
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,960
rebelling against you.

529
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
Ling Dong manages him quite well.

530
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,480
He is my cousin!

531
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,360
He's definitely great!

532
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Let me tell you something serious.

533
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,440
Over these years,

534
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,400
I've tried to support

535
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,680
Ling Dong's family,

536
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,040
but his mom refused all of it.

537
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,520
I think,

538
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,000
after her husband

539
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
passed away,

540
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,200
she couldn't get over it.

541
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,240
You understand?

542
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,520
All right, one step at a time.

543
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,480
How about another song?

544
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,200
Let's do it.

545
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,560
Let's go.
