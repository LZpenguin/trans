00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Bright Time EP07

3
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,520
We now interrupt with breaking news.

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,040
Ling Dong from Class 5, Grade 11

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
will represent Chenjun High School

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,280
once again in competition.

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
He will be participating

8
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,280
in the city talent competition.

9
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
It sounds like Lan Jinghui.

10
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,640
Ling Dong,

11
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
how did you end up

12
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,680
getting involved with Lan Jinghui?

13
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,440
Sir,

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,760
I need to go to the restroom.

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,520
I'll be right back.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,920
Go ahead.

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Ling Dong.

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,840
Let's continue.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Chen Luyang,

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,520
didn't you say you solved it too?

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,080
Yes.

22
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
OK, explain to us.

23
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,960
OK.

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,200
Guys.

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
The vigor of youth,

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
the fervor of youth,

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,360
will be fully manifested

28
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,200
through you.

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,120
Embrace and challenge yourself.

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
We have faith that you will succeed.

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,720
Ling Dong,

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,480
unleash your vitality.

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
We're rooting for you,

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,440
proud of you.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,800
Hey.

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,680
How could I not show up

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,640
when my nephew is trying so hard

38
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,480
to get my attention?

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,040
You had to withdraw

40
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,720
from the talent competition

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,080
to participate in the physics competition.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,600
I was fine with that.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
Now that the physics competition is over,

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,840
surely you can go to this one, right?

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,280
I don't get it.

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Why are you so keen on me?

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Do you want to see me every day?

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Isn't that annoying?

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm the one who's annoyed with you, OK?

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
I don't care.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
The whole school has heard

52
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,240
that you are going to

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
compete in the talent competition.

54
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,840
If you back out now,

55
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,160
you'll be a coward.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
Alright, step aside.

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,440
What are you doing?

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm going to tell the entire school

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,440
that you're my nephew.

60
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Lan Jinghui,

61
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,840
what tricks are you playing now?

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,760
Mr. Zhang.

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,800
Hello.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
Mr. Zhang, what brings you here?

65
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,360
Why am I here?

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,600
If I didn't come, you'd bring destruction.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,120
This is the broadcast room,

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,640
not your playground.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,720
Go and run some laps.

70
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,040
What about him?

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:13,960
And you...

72
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,600
Ling Dong,

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,480
I've told you many times.

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,760
I left Lan Jinghui in your care

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,440
to make sure

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,920
he could behave himself.

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,240
You can't let him have his way.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,360
I got it, sir.

79
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,880
Go back to class.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,880
See you Mr. Zhang.

81
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,080
See ya.

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,440
Just go.

83
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,640
What the...

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,560
Hey, Mr. Zhang,

85
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,400
this is preferential treatment, isn't it?

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Go on, start running laps.

87
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:36,920
I...

88
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,800
Now!

89
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,480
I...

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Run.

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Holy mother of god.

92
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,040
Xiaohua.

93
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,400
Ling Dong.

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,200
Sorry.

95
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,240
If I hadn't

96
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
withdrawn from the talent competition,

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,760
you wouldn't be in...

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,480
It's fine, Ling Dong.

99
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,200
Honestly.

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,840
We're doing great.

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
We've put in a lot of effort.

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,880
So...

103
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,480
If you're not too busy,

104
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
you could come and watch us practice.

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,360
We're not quite there yet,

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,640
but...

107
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Would you come and watch us?

108
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,720
♪A pot of cloudy wine brings fleeting joy,♪

109
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,920
♪tonight, let's forget the chill in our dreams.♪

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Have some water.

111
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,600
Thanks.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
Is it still pretty bad?

113
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
No, you're doing well, I think.

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,240
Really?

115
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,560
Absolutely.

116
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,120
You could still improve.

117
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Ling Dong.

118
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,840
What are you doing here?

119
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,840
Are you doing your

120
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,960
mind-tricks again?

121
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,960
Ling Dong came to see our practice.

122
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,360
He thinks I did really good.

123
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,000
Ignore his blabber.

124
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,520
Well, not all of it is blabber.

125
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
You've got potential,

126
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,040
and there's plenty of room to improve.

127
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
If I'm still not good enough now,

128
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,640
what if I screw up on stage

129
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
during the competition?

130
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,600
That won't happen.

131
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
As your master, I give you my word.

132
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,400
You'll be fine.

133
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,360
His pinky is over his thumb.

134
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,520
I guarantee it!

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Lan Jinghui,

136
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,840
your hand was...

137
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,640
What about it?

138
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,800
My hand's fine.

139
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,920
What's wrong with it?

140
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,040
Be gone!

141
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,800
Get out now.

142
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,400
You've overstayed.

143
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,640
Enough is enough.

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,320
Don't interrupt our practice.

145
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,360
I swear

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
to always be your friend.

147
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
Now, you should swear too.

148
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,680
That's not how it's done.

149
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,880
That's not how it's done.

150
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,640
I can't do that.

151
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,040
Watch me do it.

152
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,280
Off with you.

153
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,120
Lost in thoughts of space, are you?

154
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Since when did you become so attentive?

155
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,000
You even know I'm fond of space.

156
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
Who's attentive to you?

157
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,800
It was just a casual question, alright?

158
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,000
A casual question that's quite telling.

159
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,400
What does it mean?

160
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,640
It means, my dear nephew,

161
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
you're getting to know your uncle.

162
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,520
I'm here to study. That's quite something.

163
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,960
Don't push it.

164
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Whether I push it or not,

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
will depend on your effort.

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,040
What's this?

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,440
Can't you read?

168
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,160
A middle school workbook?

169
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
Are you mocking my intelligence?

170
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,760
I simply selected exercises

171
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
that match your level.

172
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,320
I've realized you

173
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,640
truly have a double standard.

174
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,120
What's this "selected exercises"

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
"that match my level?"

176
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,960
And I have to work through it?

177
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
I signed you up for the talent contest

178
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,240
that I thought suits your level.

179
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
Why aren't you participating?

180
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,800
Alright then.

181
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
If you can complete these exercises

182
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,400
with an error rate

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,280
under one percent,

184
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,960
then you can count me in.

185
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
And you will even join our band?

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,360
Sure.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,720
Just...

188
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,480
just like that?

189
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
But remember, you have to finish

190
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,080
with an error rate

191
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
under one percent.

192
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,880
You're not playing tricks, are you?

193
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,040
So you're saying

194
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
I can only afford one mistake?

195
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,280
What's the matter?

196
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
Think you'd fail?

197
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
I can definitely pull it off.

198
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:01,760
Good.

199
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,520
Then it's a deal.

200
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,000
Deal.

201
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,800
May your wish come true,

202
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,320
my dear nephew.

203
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Ling Dong, this time

204
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,360
you're definitely going to lose the bet.

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Once you're in the band,

206
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
I'll show you what I can do.

207
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Is this supposed to be middle school math?

208
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,800
It's ridiculously hard.

209
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,160
If you peek at the answers, the deal's off.

210
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,720
Did he put up cameras or something?

211
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,800
How would he know if I checked online?

212
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
Young man, uphold your integrity.

213
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,640
I can do this on my own.

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Alright.

215
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,640
Ling Dong, just you wait.

216
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Even on my own,

217
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,880
I'll manage to pull this off.

218
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
These middle school problems

219
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
are piece of cake.

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
Just 10 minutes.

221
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,920
All done.

222
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
So this is why you asked me to come to

223
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
school in the middle of the night.

224
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
A promise is a promise, after all.

225
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,480
Some people have a track record

226
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,800
of being untrustworthy.

227
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,040
You're not scared,

228
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,600
are you?

229
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
After all, maintaining

230
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,480
an error rate of one percent

231
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,200
is no easy task for you.

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
That's a huge misjudgment.

233
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,040
I hope after you've graded them,

234
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
you'll recognize

235
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,400
the brilliance of my brain.

236
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,040
Fine, see you tomorrow.

237
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Not so fast.

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,560
Grade them right here, right now.

239
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,400
You have that much confidence in yourself?

240
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,280
Alright.

241
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,920
Told ya!

242
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,800
Wisdom.

243
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,280
Wisdom and beauty.

244
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
See you in the rehearsal room tomorrow.

245
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,520
See you tomorrow!

246
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,280
For real?

247
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,960
Ling Dong is joining our band?

248
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,120
No way.

249
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,720
I'll bet you a bag of chips

250
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
He said yes?

251
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,200
Sure!

252
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
If he backs down,

253
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,560
I'll just...

254
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
Just what?

255
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
My...

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,040
My fellow classmate, Jinghui.

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Was that necessary?

258
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,960
To welcome me with such fervor.

259
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,240
Get your chips with this.

260
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,880
It's only through enthusiasm that

261
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,720
my sincerity shines through, right?

262
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,520
A warm welcome to our new member,

263
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,000
Ling Dong.

264
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,640
Welcome!

265
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,120
Don't you

266
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
let it slip!

267
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,960
Jinghui,

268
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,000
what's Ling Dong going to play?

269
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,920
Good question.

270
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Ling Dong won't be playing anything.

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,760
Ling Dong has a

272
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
more important task

273
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,160
awaiting him.

274
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
That is to use his hands

275
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,720
to uphold

276
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
the spirit of our entire band.

277
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Awesome!

278
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,640
Very good, Xiaohua, keep it up.

279
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,800
Lan Jinghui,

280
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,920
I won't be able to sweep.

281
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,400
Then go fetch a bottle of water.

282
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
Ling Dong, I'll go.

283
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,640
No worries, I've got it.

284
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,520
Would you like some?

285
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,600
No!

286
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,480
Open it.

287
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
I'd like some hot water.

288
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Lan Jinghui,

289
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,400
why are you ordering him around?

290
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
What ordering around?

291
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,120
Ling Dong is

292
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,760
serving us willingly.

293
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
As a member of the band,

294
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,640
he's in charge of

295
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
our logistical support.

296
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
How noble and selfless!

297
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,200
Isn't that right, Ling Dong?

298
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,240
You wanted it hot?

299
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,440
Just a moment.

300
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,920
That's burning hot!

301
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,400
What's the matter with you?

302
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
You failed to clean the floor

303
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
and to get the water right.

304
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
What can you actually do?

305
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,280
Alright, then tell me,

306
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,880
what should I do?

307
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,120
Do you know that

308
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,920
every school in the city

309
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
has to send a representative

310
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
to the talent competition?

311
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,760
Couldn't you go

312
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,560
and do some recon?

313
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,960
I need a list of their performances.

314
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,440
Master self and foe for battle success.

315
00:15:59,520 --> 00:15:59,800
Got it.

316
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,280
He must be out of his mind.

317
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
How can he drink water that hot?

318
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,920
You're the one who's out of your mind!

319
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,920
Where's Ling Dong?

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,640
That bookworm is slacking off again.

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,600
If you keep talking like that,

322
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,160
I'll stop calling you master!

323
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,920
My loyal disciple,

324
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm merely stating the facts.

325
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,960
You can't be too nice

326
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,120
to someone like Ling Dong!

327
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,600
Right now, for all we know,

328
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,520
he could be napping somewhere.

329
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
Wasn't it you who sent him

330
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,960
to conduct recon?

331
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,160
Oh, did I?

332
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Well, he shouldn't be using up

333
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,880
our valuable rehearsal time,

334
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,360
right?

335
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,360
He could use his personal time,

336
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,840
right?

337
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
What "time" are you talking about?

338
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,840
What's this?

339
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,600
Can't you read?

340
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
Summary of the talent contest programs.

341
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,080
Is this your work?

342
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,160
It includes each school's

343
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,640
types of performances and the

344
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,360
scores based on the judges' preferences

345
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,920
from previous years.

346
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,920
It's all here.

347
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,920
That's quite impressive!

348
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,480
Indeed!

349
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,440
What's so impressive about this?

350
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,960
Isn't it simple?

351
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
I've also set up a WeChat group for us,

352
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,760
to make future communication easier.

353
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,160
A WeChat group

354
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,000
called "Rooftop Squad." (Tian Tai Xiao Fen Dui)

355
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,160
Isn't that name a bit lame?

356
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,160
Rooftop Squad?

357
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,040
Ling Dong,

358
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,880
your sense for names is really off.

359
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,360
I think it's quite nice.

360
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
I also think it's good.

361
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
'Tian' stands for Xia Qingtian.

362
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,480
'Xiao' is for Xiao Xiaohua.

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,440
'Fen' represents Ling Dong's high scores,

364
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,760
and as for 'Dui' (squad/team)...

365
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,360
I aspire to lead the basketball team!

366
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,680
So we are

367
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,160
the Rooftop Squad.

368
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,720
What about my name?

369
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,000
Our band's formation

370
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,120
also owes to the encouragement

371
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,240
you gave me on the rooftop, master.

372
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:11,880
But apprentice,

373
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
isn't that a bit of a stretch?

374
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,920
Though it does make some sense.

375
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,280
Let's celebrate the formation of

376
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,520
the Rooftop Squad!

377
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
Great!

378
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,600
Stop!

379
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,880
I reserve my judgment.

380
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
Rooftop Squad, what kind of taste is that?

381
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,760
No worries.

382
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,040
I've already experienced

383
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,680
your poor taste.

384
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,920
Ling Dong, what do you mean by that?

385
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,320
Why are you treating him like this?

386
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,480
Exactly, Lan Jinghui, what do you want?

387
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,760
Three against one,

388
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,080
bullying Jinghui, huh?

389
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,960
Ma Yiming, you little...

390
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,520
Jinghui, hey...

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
I didn't mean to...

392
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,840
Ma Yiming, watch it.

393
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,280
In the long and lonely

394
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,200
school days.

395
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,720
For the first time, I felt

396
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,760
the warmth of a group.

397
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,560
The Rooftop Squad is now established!

398
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,440
Grandma, I'm back.

399
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Jinghui, are you hungry?

400
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,600
Nope.

401
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,880
Grandma will make you some wontons.

402
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,400
Grandma, I'm not hungry.

403
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,200
Sit, sit.

404
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,760
Dad.

405
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,960
You're not hungry? It's been a long day.

406
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,920
No thanks, grandma.

407
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm really not hungry.

408
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,560
I've been stuffed at school.

409
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
Alright, thank you, grandma.

410
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm going upstairs, grandma.

411
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
You, look at you.

412
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,400
You rarely come home,

413
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,680
and when you finally do, you just...

414
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,480
Jinghui doesn't want wontons.

415
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,360
He must be craving the noodles you make.

416
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,520
He's always been like this.

417
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,640
Go on,

418
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,240
make some noodles for your son.

419
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Later.

420
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,400
You don't do as I say?

421
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,680
Are you cooking or not?

422
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Mom, mom...

423
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,680
Are you going or not?

424
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,200
Sure.

425
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,480
Jinghui is at home.

426
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,760
Could you be considerate of my dignity?

427
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,960
Fine, off you go.

428
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,840
Hey, Jinghui.

429
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,240
Stop.

430
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,400
Ma Yiming, your drumbeat was too early.

431
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,120
The rhythm was not steady.

432
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,200
Why don't you mention Xia Qingtian

433
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,000
is always a beat behind?

434
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,800
You have the nerve to criticize me?

435
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
It was you that messed up the flow.

436
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
You can't keep up with the rhythm.

437
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,600
I couldn't play in the first place.

438
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,960
I've been trying my best!

439
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm out!

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,880
As you please.

441
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,440
Stop it, both of you.

442
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,720
It's my fault.

443
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
I've been a lousy singer.

444
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,280
What's this?

445
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,120
I took some notes on the parts

446
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,600
where everyone tends to make mistakes.

447
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,520
I'm aware of the issues.

448
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,040
I don't need you to remind me.

449
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,840
So it turns out I'm the one

450
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,440
with the biggest issue, huh?

451
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,400
Qingtian,

452
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,040
this is an issue for all of us,

453
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,400
not yours alone.

454
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,560
Xiaohua,

455
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,920
I know it's my problem.

456
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
I've been holding everyone back.

457
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
Maybe you should replace me.

458
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,640
I don't want to ruin

459
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,200
your performance.

460
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,040
You're talking

461
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,920
from a position of comfort.

462
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,440
If you quit on us now,

463
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,520
how are we supposed to find a replacement?

464
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,520
I can give it a shot.

465
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,160
Do you know how to play?

466
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,240
Not really.

467
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,600
If you don't, what's the point?

468
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,840
But I'm willing to learn.

469
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,800
I'll teach you.

470
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,000
Come on, enlighten me, genius.

471
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,360
How many strings does a guitar have?

472
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,760
Six.

473
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,840
Good answer.

474
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,680
He seems to be teaching a retard.

475
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,120
I'll only explain once,

476
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,000
so listen up.

477
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,960
The thumb is for the top three strings.

478
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,040
Index, middle, and ring fingers,

479
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,120
from the bottom up,

480
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,160
are for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd strings.

481
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,160
Give it a try.

482
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,320
Relax your hand.

483
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,560
Strum.

484
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,200
Do it!

485
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,840
Why are you so clumsy?

486
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Have you ever seen anyone play the guitar

487
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,040
holding it from the bottom? Try the top!

488
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
And you're supposed to be a top student.

489
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,040
I guess I have to start from

490
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,360
the kindergarten level, right?

491
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,760
An instrument isn't like science.

492
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,560
Why does Jinghui always

493
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,520
talk to Ling Dong like that?

494
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,680
For your information,

495
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,920
it's usually Ling Dong who tutors Jinghui.

496
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,080
Now that Jinghui finally

497
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,640
has a chance to teach Ling Dong something,

498
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,000
he must seize it and savor it.

499
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm confident

500
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
Ling Dong will definitely nail it.

501
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,440
Guys, you've worked so hard.

502
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,240
Hello, Mr. Zhang!

503
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,920
Greetings, sir!

504
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
Alright, alright.

505
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm here on behalf of the school

506
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,120
to offer encouragement to you.

507
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,440
How's the practice coming along?

508
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,200
Mr. Zhang, you can be assured,

509
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,920
we, the Rooftop Squad promises

510
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,920
to deliver a stunning performance.

511
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,640
Rooftop Squad?

512
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,240
Yes, that's us.

513
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,000
Nice name, who came up with it?

514
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,920
We thought of it together.

515
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,400
Yes, together.

516
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,560
Fantastic.

517
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,920
This talent competition

518
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,200
really relies

519
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
on all of you.

520
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,600
Let's all put in our best effort,

521
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,080
OK?

522
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,560
Don't let the school down.

523
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,240
Winning or losing isn't the main concern,

524
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,200
what matters is

525
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,400
that we reflect

526
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,000
the spirit of Chenjun High School.

527
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,640
Go for it!

528
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,800
Okey-dokey!

529
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah!

530
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,880
Yeah!

531
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,760
Alright, I'll be heading back now.

532
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,400
Goodbye, Mr. Zhang.

533
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,400
Thank you, sir.

534
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,160
Rooftop Squad, huh?

535
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,160
Who was it that was

536
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,920
yelling on the rooftop the other day?

537
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,960
Lan Jinghui.

538
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,840
Why do I feel like that voice

539
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,000
sounded a lot like yours?

540
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,440
Tian, sweetie,

541
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,080
how come my drum is blue?

542
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,120
Ma Yiming?

543
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,920
Hey, Qingtian.

544
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,800
Why is this drum blue?

545
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,560
His guitar is blue too!

546
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,560
His microphone is blue as well!

547
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,880
Blue!

548
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,080
Here, plug this in.

549
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,440
Blue, haha.

550
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,920
It's blue.

551
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Hee-hee! Blue!

552
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Let's play with the drumsticks!

553
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,920
Drumsticks, drumsticks!

554
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,360
Yo, drumsticks.

555
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,760
Drumsticks, y'all!

556
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,360
Drumsticks.

557
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,360
It's blue.

558
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,240
Qingtian, sweetie, drumsticks are so fun!

559
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,560
Alrighty, drumsticks it is!

560
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,200
Drumsticks!

561
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
Drumsticks, yay!

562
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,720
Ma Yiming, are you an idiot?

563
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,360
The six elements of a triangle,

564
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,280
we know,

565
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,880
a, b, c,

566
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,760
they represent the sides.

567
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,240
A, B, C

568
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,320
they represent the angles.

569
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,840
Now I'd like to ask you guys,

570
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
what is the sum

571
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,960
of angles A, B, and C?

572
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,080
Ma Yiming?

573
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,880
It's...

574
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,040
Ling Dong, tell him.

575
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,080
One hundred and eighty degrees.

576
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,360
Alright, let's continue.

577
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,640
We know

578
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,360
a, b and c represent the sides.

579
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,120
Then A, B...

580
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,840
Incredible!

581
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,360
Truly a top student.

582
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,240
You pulled it off in such a short time.

583
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,040
Indeed.

584
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,480
I've said it.

585
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,600
Ling Dong could nail it, right?

586
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,960
Thanks to my superior teaching skills!

587
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,960
No one is giving me credit.

588
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,800
Time to eat.

589
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
Feast!

590
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Wait up.

591
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
This is high-end, classy, and upscale.

592
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,520
You all look good.

593
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,040
"Chenjun is bound to win."

594
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,520
So much power.

595
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
Just wear this for the competition.

596
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,480
Sir,

597
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,280
isn't this a bit dated?

598
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,080
Not at all!

599
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
The principal specifically ordered,

600
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,960
and it's a special outfit

601
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,680
tailored for you overnight.

602
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,480
It represents

603
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,440
the spirit of

604
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
Chenjun High School,

605
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,840
a spirit of certain victory.

606
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
You lack depth in your thinking!

607
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,200
Go back to your practice!

608
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,520
My shirt doesn't have any word.

609
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,040
He doesn't have a word.

610
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,840
Why doesn't Ling Dong have any word?

611
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,760
He...

612
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,400
He doesn't have a word on his shirt.

613
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,040
What?

614
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,360
No word.

615
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,920
Hmm, much better!

616
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,760
Now we are "Chenjun is bound to win!"

617
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,520
With an exclamation mark.

618
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm not wearing this.

619
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
What are you doing?

620
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,120
It's such a creative idea, don't waste it.

621
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,160
I want yours.

622
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,280
Hold on.

623
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,240
If you really want to change it,

624
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,240
I'll find another one for you.

625
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,480
Ma Yiming,

626
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,320
take yours off and give it to him.

627
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,840
Forget it!

628
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,960
Ling Dong, let's take his off.

629
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,360
Stop, stop!

630
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,920
Have you ever seen

631
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
the things of Los Angeles at 4 a.m.?

632
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,640
Hey, bro, now it's only 11pm.

633
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
I'm trying to capture that atmosphere.

634
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,960
Are we going or not? Go home?

635
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,000
Right away.
