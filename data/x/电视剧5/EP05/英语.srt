1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,820
Bright Time EP05

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,560
I voted for Xu Mengyu,

4
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,680
and now she's the chair!

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,080
Who's Xu Mengyu?

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
Is she among the candidates?

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
You haven't heard of her?

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,200
She's a renowned talented girl

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,120
in our school.

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,320
Her mom is the head of

11
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,560
the Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,680
She even published

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,200
her first book

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
when she's just 13!

15
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,680
I can see why she landed

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,400
the Student Union presidency

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,720
without even showing up for campaign.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,880
Moreover,

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,280
she's both talented and beautiful.

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,280
I heard half of the votes

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,200
she got were from her fans

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,080
who were smitten by her appearance!

23
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,600
Hey, hear me out!

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,800
The crazy part is,

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,280
Bi Peng was all over the place

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,560
in that tight hallway,

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,960
jumping around,

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
begging for forgiveness,

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,320
then just

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
bawling his eyes out...

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,800
Hey, what are you looking at?

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,840
Hi there,

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,880
if it's

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,560
a dating letter,

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm super busy today.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,440
Just chuck it here,

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
I'll check it out later.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Excuse me.

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,200
You're sitting in my seat.

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,240
Mengyu! Finally!

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,760
You're back.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,520
Mengyu,

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
you missed out on a lot

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
during your absence.

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,480
I heard you're

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,600
putting out a book of essays!

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,960
Where have you been recently?

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,840
I'll answer your questions one by one.

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Ma Yiming, look!

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
They rushed forward

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,880
when seeing the beautiful girl.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,800
Only you're the calmest.

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:34,960
Jinghui...

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Mengyu!

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,200
I miss you terribly!

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,840
What's wrong with him?

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,080
Hey buddy, it turns out

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,160
you're

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,960
the...

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Where are you going?

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,160
Xiaohua.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,040
Qingtian.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,680
This story

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,200
is gonna be crazy good later.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,920
Gotta hit the loo first.

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,280
We'll be right back.

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,600
Chen Luyang.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,120
Call me Mr President.

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Chill out!

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,160
My story is way more exciting.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
Hear me out.

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,240
Is this how people are?

73
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Where's your letter?

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,520
You take the lead.

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,120
Hand over yours first.

76
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,680
Hurry up.

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,400
One by one.

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,080
Xu Mengyu.

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
Here's the letter I wrote for you.

80
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,200
Thank you.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,800
This is my letter.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,720
The blue one

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,480
is mine.

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,520
And mine!

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
Let me read it to you.

86
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,880
Don't.

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
The smell of sweaty feet

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
is overwhelming here!

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,240
Stink!

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,960
What's your essay all about?

91
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,440
I just shared

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,000
some of my thoughts

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
on life.

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,840
Can you change the subject?

95
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,520
Hey, quiet down,

96
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm trying to study here.

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
Well... I wonder

98
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,560
if you're interested

99
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,400
in the new movie released this week?

100
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Chen Luyang, where are you off to?

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,240
Reading in the hallway.

102
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
Why there?

103
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,000
Xu Mengyu's here,

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
don't you have to

105
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,840
report to her

106
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,040
about recent work?

107
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,440
Just filling in as VP for now.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,520
I'm gearing up for

109
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,760
the chair election next year.

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,160
My first plan is...

111
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,280
No election next year.

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
I've got some other plans.

113
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,800
Qingtian!

114
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,840
Your skin's shining,

115
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,760
and you're looking slimmer.

116
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,360
Yeah.

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,120
Mengyu,

118
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
what are you reading there?

119
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,720
A chemistry book.

120
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,480
Chemistry is not my strong suit either.

121
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,640
It's seriously a tough nut to crack.

122
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,320
Just do your best.

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,000
Well...

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,600
Sir, I'm Ling Dong.

125
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,200
Ling Dong, Chen Luyang.

126
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
Since you two

127
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,480
are top in the physics subject,

128
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,000
you must figure this one out.

129
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
Alright. Let's get started.

130
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,880
Right direction,

131
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,680
but too convoluted.

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,560
Try to simplify.

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,880
Sir.

134
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm done.

135
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,560
Really?

136
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
I didn't even think of that solution.

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,280
Impressive!

138
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,440
Ling Dong.

139
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,240
You nailed it fast!

140
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm truly proud of you.

141
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,600
Ling Dong.

142
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
You're a genius.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,400
Don't get

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,760
too carried away.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,760
Back to your work.

146
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,440
Genius are rare. What's important

147
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,400
is putting in the effort.

148
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,360
Well then, sir, I'm leaving.

149
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,560
Bye, sir.

150
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,360
Bye.

151
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,240
Where are you off to?

152
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Wanna eat alone, huh?

153
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,440
No. No way.

154
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,360
Hi, Ms Fang.

155
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,600
Hello, Ms Fang.

156
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,720
Ms Fang. Thank you.

157
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,480
It's really thoughtful of you

158
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,720
to get us the new rack

159
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,400
to do plant-caring.

160
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,800
You like it?

161
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes.

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Right. We do.

163
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,960
Good then.

164
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,760
Well, ma'am,

165
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,320
what brings you

166
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,360
to us?

167
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,240
What?

168
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,960
You don't want me here?

169
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,040
Am I ruining your appetite?

170
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,880
Gosh, of course not.

171
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,240
You're so pretty, nice,

172
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,840
sweet, and generous,

173
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,400
it's impossible for us

174
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,120
to lose our appetite around you.

175
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,280
I could wolf down 3 bowls of rice.

176
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,520
Good.

177
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,040
Then, I have

178
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,880
another good news

179
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
to share with you.

180
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,160
Cool.

181
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
After talking to Mr. Zhang,

182
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,840
we're gonna set you up

183
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,520
with Ling Dong

184
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,520
in a study group thing.

185
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,640
He'll help you out, one-on-one.

186
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,920
Ling Dong?

187
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,280
Me and him?

188
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,440
Ms Fang. You must be joking.

190
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,800
Do I look like

191
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,880
I'm joking?

192
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,720
But, ma'am,

193
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,080
what kinda good news is this?

194
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,520
What's not good about it?

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,080
Ling Dong ranks first

196
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
in our grade.

197
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,360
With his help,

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,080
you're sure

199
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,160
to make rapid progress.

200
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,880
Others

201
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,320
are dying to have this.

202
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,000
So don't be ungrateful,

203
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
study your hardest

204
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
and don't

205
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,280
let us down.

206
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,680
Ling Dong.

207
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,000
You okay with that?

208
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120
Alright, I won't

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
disturb you here anymore.

210
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,040
C'mon...

211
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm out. Enjoy your meal.

212
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,120
Bye. Ms Fang.

213
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,200
Wait...

214
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,960
Why didn't you say no?

215
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,480
Why didn't you?

216
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm at the bottom of the grade,

217
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I can't change anything.

218
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,320
But if you refused,

219
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,720
she might

220
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,960
have stopped the group

221
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,160
'cause I'd

222
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,520
badly impact your studies.

223
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,840
No need for that.

224
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,840
And Xiaohua,

225
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,840
no offense,

226
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
but can you be sincere

227
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,880
when expressing your gratitude?

228
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,440
At least ask about my preferences.

229
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,840
How could I know that you don't like

230
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
such delicious tomatoes?

231
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,960
What? They look disgusting!

232
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,960
Why are you staring at me?

233
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,760
Why don't you eat tomatoes?

234
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,920
Why?

235
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,400
I don't like that.

236
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,440
I haven't liked them

237
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,800
since I was young.

238
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Who are you

239
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,200
to ask so much about me?

240
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,640
You tell me, my...

241
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,040
He is...

242
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
a disaster to me.

243
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,280
You know, disaster.

244
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,640
How can you say that?

245
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,360
If it weren't for his recording,

246
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,240
our class wouldn't

247
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,000
have been cleared of injustice.

248
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,400
Alright, alright.

249
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,440
You're keep ganging up on me,

250
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,760
just let me eat my food in peace, okay?

251
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,400
Sure. Enjoy yourself.

252
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,800
Catch you at the study room soon.

253
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,280
Who said I'd study?

254
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm off too.

255
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,720
Wait.

256
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Xiaohua.

257
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,440
Do me a solid.

258
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,320
What?

259
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Go to the study room for me, will you?

260
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,320
Xiaohua.

261
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,200
Does he want you to cover for him?

262
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,280
Wanna boost your grades?

263
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,120
Yeah, for sure.

264
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,480
I have a plan.

265
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,800
But I need your help.

266
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,400
I didn't expect Xiao Xiaohua

267
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,520
to get so close with Ling Dong

268
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,240
while I was out for a bit.

269
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,960
All thanks to that Ash Lan.

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,680
What?

271
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
You got Xiaohua to study for you?

272
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,120
Don't you think Ling Dong

273
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,880
will rat you out to Mr. Zhang?

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,320
So what?

275
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
I'm telling you.

276
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
I've got beef

277
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,200
with him.

278
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,280
Sitting with him

279
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,920
in the study room

280
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,640
is worse than cleaning toilets.

281
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,680
Lan Jinghui.

282
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,120
Hey, why are you here?

283
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,840
But

284
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,200
you should be in the study room.

285
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Asked by Ling Dong.

286
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,400
Lan Jinghui's Don't-Do List?

287
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,000
Go away.

288
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,080
I don't want it.

289
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,240
Wait.

290
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,560
He asked me to give this to you.

291
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,400
No matter what's written on it,

292
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I won't even give in.

293
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,720
Do you want your identity as my nephew

294
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,000
to be made public?

295
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,720
He said the content above

296
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,400
is effective for you.

297
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,520
What?

298
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,360
Let me take a look.

299
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,080
Get away.

300
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,840
Stay back.

301
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,680
Ling Dong took him down

302
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,160
with a single slip of paper?

303
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,160
What's on the note?

304
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,200
I don't know.

305
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,840
Didn't you read it?

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,680
Nope.

307
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,600
Why?

308
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,720
Have a sit.

309
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,040
C'mon, the same old way, huh?

310
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,800
It works, doesn't it?

311
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
Do you now know how much

312
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,880
I care about you as your uncle?

313
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,600
I told you

314
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,800
no more

315
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
of that.

316
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,720
Alright. Hit the books.

317
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,120
Nephew.

318
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,640
Stop there!

319
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,880
Start with this one first.

320
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,560
You're so scheming, like you've

321
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
got a whole library

322
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
in your gut.

323
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,880
Homework.

324
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
Finish grading these by class end.

325
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,160
Goodbye, Miss Li.

326
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,520
Jinghui, let's ball out!

327
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,000
Wait.

328
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,000
Hurry up.

329
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Tonight's the big clan battle.

330
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,320
I got this. Just watch me shine.

331
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,040
I'm bringing my

332
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,640
A-game tonight.

333
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,000
Lan Jinghui.

334
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,520
Done with your homework?

335
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
It's Friday.

336
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,520
Oh, right! It's Friday.

337
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,040
Yeah.

338
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
So you're getting double.

339
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,160
Come here.

340
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,560
Lan Jinghui.

341
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,280
Finish all test papers!

342
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,640
All of them!

343
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,760
I can't bear it anymore.

344
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,160
What's up?

345
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,880
What's up?

346
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,320
Nerd.

347
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,920
Excuse me, what's this?

348
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,440
You serious?

349
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,280
Basically,

350
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,560
it's a talent show.

351
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,480
Each school sends one representative

352
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,160
to participate in.

353
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,600
We've never been absent,

354
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,520
but never won either.

355
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
Every other school

356
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,120
has ever taken home the trophy.

357
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm sure you've heard that

358
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,800
the talent show

359
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,120
sign-ups are live.

360
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,200
But it will be

361
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,480
different

362
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,520
this year.

363
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,400
You gotta

364
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,720
film yourself

365
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,240
doing your best talent

366
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,280
and upload it

367
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,160
to the school website.

368
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,400
Then,

369
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
all the students will vote,

370
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,920
and whoever gets the most

371
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,400
will be the rep.

372
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
Now, don't stress

373
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,480
too much about it.

374
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,960
Each and every one of you

375
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,880
have to submit

376
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,800
a video,

377
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,520
okay?

378
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,040
Okay.

379
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,040
Go for it, guys.

380
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
Show us what you're made of.

381
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,120
Okay,

382
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,000
class time.

383
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,400
What's your thing?

384
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,360
Everyone gotta put up a video.

385
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,440
I got nothing special.

386
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,840
Come on. I can show you

387
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,840
some cool basketball moves.

388
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,080
You know,

389
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,560
spinning the ball on your finger?

390
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,280
You've got too much free time

391
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,560
on your hands, huh?

392
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,240
Qingtian. What should we do?

393
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,800
We have no choice

394
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,320
but to make a video.

395
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,840
What's your plan?

396
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,240
I'm set,

397
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
just gonna recite some poems.

398
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,040
No way I'm gonna get picked anyway.

399
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,480
But

400
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm not good at anything.

401
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,400
Relax. Xiaohua.

402
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,360
No one's gonna

403
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,200
pay attention to us.

404
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,600
Just throw something together

405
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,800
and call it a day.

406
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,320
Right.

407
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,560
Mengyu, your dance

408
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,680
is amazing!

409
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,040
You're leading the vote count

410
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,240
right now.

411
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,960
It's still up in the air with the votes,

412
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,200
can't say for sure I'll make it.

413
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,720
You've got this.

414
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,800
No one can top you.

415
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,520
You're gonna be

416
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,600
our school's rep for sure.

417
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Yes.

418
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,600
Mengyu's gonna be

419
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,480
our school's rep for sure.

420
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Hey, cut it out.

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
You're making me jittery now.

422
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,320
Take it easy.

423
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,400
Wait.

424
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,520
It's not even a done deal yet,

425
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
and you're already dreaming big.

426
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I didn't ask for this,

427
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,080
but the votes keep coming in my way.

428
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,160
What can I do?

429
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,120
Yeah.

430
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
Mengyu didn't force anyone.

431
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,640
Xiaohua.

432
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,280
You still haven't filmed your thing?

433
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,360
I'm still stuck on what to do.

434
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,080
So, what now?

435
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,040
I'm all thumbs.

436
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,040
I tried to film last night...

437
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
No fear,

438
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,800
I got your back.

439
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,640
Let's go.

440
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Qingtian.

441
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
It's okay. I know what to do.

442
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,800
Let's go, Ma Yiming.

443
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,400
Hurry!

444
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,760
Uh...

445
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,200
what should I do then?

446
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,200
Anything, just get moving.

447
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,240
Move, move, move!

448
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,560
You're moving like a robot.

449
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,840
I told you that

450
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,120
I can't do anything.

451
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,840
How about dance?

452
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,600
Dance then. Come on.

453
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,920
Move, move, move.

454
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,480
Singing?

455
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,160
Singing's easy, right?

456
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Everybody knows how to do that.

457
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:25,880
Okay.

458
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,360
Here's a countdown.

459
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,640
3, 2,1, go!

460
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,440
Let's just scrap this.

461
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,120
Sing whatever comes to mind.

462
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,360
Just do it.

463
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,960
No one's around to judge.

464
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Okay. Now.

465
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,840
3, 2, 1, go!

466
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,840
♪Out the side of road shelter,♪

467
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,600

473
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,960
I don't remember the rest.

474
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,440
Okay. Stop.

475
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,200
It's okay. We've got this.

476
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,400
Perfect.

477
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,200
It's done, Jinghui?

478
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,560
Yes.

479
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,840
I gotta take care of

480
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
something more crucial.

481
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,440
What's up?

482
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,960
Jinghui.

483
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,880
Sorry for that.

484
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,000
Leave me alone.

485
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,640
Give it back to me.

486
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
You should be studying,

487
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,280
so I'm taking this away.

488
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,120
What?

489
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,520
I'll...

490
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
do an extra test paper tonight.

491
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,080
Can I get it back?

492
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,720
Three.

493
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,520
That's too...

494
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,000
Four.

495
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
Alright.

496
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,800
Four then.

497
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,800
Hand them over tomorrow morning.

498
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,040
Ling Dong!

499
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,640
We'll see.

500
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,480
Dear teachers

501
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,160
and classmates,

502
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,480
good morning!

503
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,240
I'm Ling Dong from Class 5, Grade 11.

504
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
I'm excited to share with you

505
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,880
an article called "Chasing Dreams".

506
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,360
The existence of dreams

507
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,600
is what gradually shapes our growth.

508
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,720
Dreams are not just whimsical fantasies.

509
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
They are the aspirations.

510
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,280
Each dream serves as a beacon,

511
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,040
guiding us out of the comfort zone

512
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,480
and into maturity.

513
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,280
During this process,

514
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,360
we need to overcome obstacles.

515
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,080
Chasing doesn't

516
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,360
simply imply reaching the destination.

517
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,200
Look, the composition,

518
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,480
lighting,

519
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,120
and camera movement...

520
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,040
Done your homework yet?

521
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
Don't choose B for all the questions.

522
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,960
Why can't I?

523
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm a boy,

524
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,640
and I like basketball. I choose B.

525
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
Where are you going?

526
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,120
Wait for me.

527
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,080
Slow down.

528
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,840
I'm losing you!

529
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,400
Yeah.

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,080
It wasn't easy

531
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,800
for me to

532
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,120
help you get picked.

533
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,720
Qingtian. What's up?

534
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,640
You gave me a jolt there!

535
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Ling Dong.

536
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,840
Ling Dong?

537
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,120
What about him?

538
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,760
Check out this video

539
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,200
he put up recently,

540
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,840
it's blown up and is now in the top ten!

541
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,840
Is that Ling Dong?

542
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
Who else could it be?

543
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,200
Seriously?

544
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,880
I thought he was

545
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
all books and no play,

546
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,920
but look at him

547
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,920
go with that dance!

548
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
But something just

549
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,760
doesn't seem right.

550
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,160
It doesn't quite feel like him.

551
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,880
Who else could it possibly be?

552
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,360
What are you doing?

553
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,600
Voting for him.

554
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,800
Don't you wanna see him in the show?

555
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,880
Ling Dong, nice moves!

556
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll be there rooting for you.

557
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,200
Ling Dong,

558
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,080
great street dance!

559
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,760
Already voted for you.

560
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,720
Street dance?

561
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I think Ling Dong's talent

562
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,640
is really impressive.

563
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,680
I prefer Ling Dong.

564
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,520
Ling Dong, congrats.

565
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,440
You're number one now.

566
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,920
I don't mind

567
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,840
being surpassed by you.

568
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,040
I really hope you can become

569
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,440
the rep of the school.

570
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,920
If you need any help,

571
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,840
feel free to reach out to me.

572
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,560
I've got last year's show

573
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,520
under my belt.

574
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,440
Not my cup of tea.

575
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,840
Anything else?

576
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,760
Nope.

577
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,000
Ling Dong, congrats.

578
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,720
Nice editing skills.

579
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,160
Thanks.

580
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,000
You may not be good at dancing,

581
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,400
but I'll do everything

582
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,200
for you.

583
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,600
Lan Jinghui.

584
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,920
I know

585
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,600
what you're up to.

586
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,400
What?

587
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,920
What am I up to?

588
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,640
Please speak out

589
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,800
all your thoughts.

590
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,400
I...

591
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,280
Let's not waste

592
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,160
each other's time, okay?

593
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,280
What am I up to?

594
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
Ling Dong. Ling Dong.

595
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,600
What am I up to?

596
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,800
Congrats. Congrats. Congrats.

597
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,000
Check out that video of the girl

598
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,560
from Class 5, Grade 11.

599
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,840
It's cracking me up,

600
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,800
so funny!

601
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
Yeah? I'm out of the loop.

602
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
Go check it, I even cast a vote for her.

603
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,360
She can't even sing on key,

604
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,800
how's she up there in the top ten?

605
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,360
Some people voted

606
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
'cause she's funny.

607
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,480
Trying to do something

608
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,800
she's not good at with all seriousness,

609
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,760
that's hilarious.

610
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,440
Not me. I voted for her.

611
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,320
Because I can see

612
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,880
her true side.

613
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,240
Although

614
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,040
she's not good at singing,

615
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,800
her focus on this

616
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,080
has inspired me a lot.

617
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,760
Alright, I'm gonna vote for her too.

618
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,000
Xiaohua.

619
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,920
Xiaohua. You've reached

620
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,200
second place now!

621
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,680
For real? Don't mess with me like that.

622
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,920
I went nuts when I

623
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,640
caught wind of it.

624
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,960
You sure you're not mistaken?

625
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,600
How'd she pass me?

626
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,360
Why can't she?

627
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,000
We're all

628
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,760
human.

629
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,640
What makes you think

630
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,480
you're so special?

631
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:38,760
You...

632
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,000
For what?

633
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,560
Enough, Qingtian.

634
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,440
This situation

635
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,760
is indeed weird.

636
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,840
Anyway,

637
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,280
I won't pose a threat to the first place.

638
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,280
Glad you know your limits.

639
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,120
What's that supposed to mean?

640
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Xia Qingtian!

641
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,080
Watch your tone.

642
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So what?

643
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,400
You...

644
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,440
So rude.

645
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,840
She dissed Xiaohua first.

646
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,240
Even so,

647
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,120
you shouldn't be rude.

648
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Ma Yiming.

649
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,760
Watch your tone.

650
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,920
So what?

651
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,960
Don't talk to

652
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,080
girls like that.

653
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,200
What did I say wrong?

654
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,080
I just can't let her...

655
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Enough. Stop.

656
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,680
Well...

657
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,280
First place is not gonna be mine.

658
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,080
People are just

659
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
voting for me for fun.

660
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,200
Excuse me.

661
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,320
Please vote for Xu Mengyu.

662
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,800
Hi. Please support Xu Mengyu.

663
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,720
Please cast a vote for Xu Mengyu.

664
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,320
Thank you.

665
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
Hi. Please vote for Xu Mengyu.

666
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,280
Thank you.

667
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,280
Thank you.

668
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,640
Please vote for Xu Mengyu.

669
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:44,880
Okay.

670
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,280
Thank you.

671
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,000
Hi.

672
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,080
Mengyu.

673
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,480
Who put you up to this?

674
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,040
Just wanna get some votes for you.

675
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,880
I don't need that.

676
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,840
So embarrassing.

677
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,040
You wouldn't get it.

678
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,040
You know.

679
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,040
I was finally getting into

680
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,920
the swing of studying.

681
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,840
And now that you've been elected,

682
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,760
no time to help me with my studies.

683
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,200
Looks like

684
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,560
I'm holding you back.

685
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,520
Of course not.

686
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,160
But

687
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,960
the sadness in my heart

688
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
flows like a mighty river.

689
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,880
It's truly upsetting.

690
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,280
For real?

691
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,880
Sure.

692
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,840
Okay, I see.

693
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,680
What did you say?

694
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,600
About your sadness?

695
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,960
What do you mean?

696
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,160
What happened?

697
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,880
Jinghui!

698
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,000
Hey, mate.

699
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,680
Calm down! I'm still breathing here.

700
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,880
Attention, please.

701
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,720
An announcement.

702
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,760
An announcement.

703
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,800
Due to personal reasons,

704
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,360
Ling Dong from Class 5, Grade 2

705
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,920
has withdrawn from the selection.

706
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,960
The ranking has been adjusted.

707
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,400
Xiao Xiaohua, in second place,

708
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
is far ahead.

709
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,720
Hello, everyone.

710
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,840
I'm Xiao Xiaohua from Class 5, Grade 2.

711
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,160
Hi, what are you doing?

712
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,320
Mom, you scared me!

713
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,360
I'm filming a video.

714
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,560
Yeah?

715
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
Don't peek.

716
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,360
School assignment.

717
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,680
I brought you some fruit.

718
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,480
Thanks, just leave it there.

719
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,120
I'm curious.

720
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,120
Stop there.

721
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,280
Alright.

722
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,160
Forget it.

723
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,600
Hi, guys.

724
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,080
I'm Chen Luyang.

725
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,080
I'm gonna recite the number

726
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,000
used to

727
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
calculate the size of circles...

728
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,240
Hi, everyone.

729
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,600
I'm Lan Jinghui from Class 5, Grade 2.

730
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
I have no intention of participating

731
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,440
in the talent show, thank you.
