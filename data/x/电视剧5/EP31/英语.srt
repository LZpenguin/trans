1
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Students

2
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,080
Prepare for the exam later

3
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,000
Sitting today

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Our examination room

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,880
They are all from our school

6
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
Top students

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
Although you guys are already excellent

8
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,320
But the teacher still wants you

9
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,120
Getting your best

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,920
Correct one's attitude towards the examination

11
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,680
The teacher believes everyone will be fine

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
Four papers today

13
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
An answer sheet

14
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
Teacher now start handing it out

15
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh my God, Ling Dong actually fell to

16
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
Consolidated the class

17
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Did he take the exam with his eyes closed

18
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,520
Is he this time

19
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,480
I only write the answer but not the process

20
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,320
Lan Jinghui also passed the consolidation class

21
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,200
Clear day

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,920
We have to work hard

23
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
What about the agreed goal

24
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,560
Well

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
Next time it will definitely be better

26
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,520
Well

27
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,080
Refuel

28
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
Yeah, come on, come on

29
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,840
I really don't understand

30
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
English and Science Comprehensive

31
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
Multiple-choice questions for these two subjects

32
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
You only picked half

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,480
You have to tell me why

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Director, I misread the serial number

35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,320
By the time I find out

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,200
It's too late to change

37
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,720
Wrong serial number

38
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,560
Both doors are misread, right

39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,800
Yes

40
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,400
I was really careless this time

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,800
Will definitely pay attention next time

42
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,760
Go back to class

43
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Goodbye, Director

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
Why did Dongdong fall into the consolidation class?

45
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,880
Dagang

46
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,800
Sister-in-law

47
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,720
You

48
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,920
All these years

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
You said you wouldn't change it either

50
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
Your habit of not being late

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
I'm fifteen minutes early

52
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,520
Still too late

53
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,760
Please take a seat

54
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,160
sit

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,360
That coffee

56
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
Which one would you like

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,120
Black coffee

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Good

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,040
Sister-in-law, what would you like to drink

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
Coffee and all that stuff

61
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm not used to drinking

62
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
I'll just drink plain water

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,440
Okay

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Dagang

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,800
It's hard to be a teacher

66
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,760
You see, your hair is white

67
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,280
Worry about it

68
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,000
Now this kid

69
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,480
More thoughtful and more thoughtful

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,520
I can't control it

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,160
Yes

72
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,520
Hello, your coffee

73
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,960
Thank you

74
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,200
Thank you

75
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,520
Okay, let's put it here

76
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
You suddenly contacted me

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,000
Is it because of Ling Dong

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes

79
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,360
Dongdong, the child

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,680
Recent academic performance

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,760
has been slipping

82
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
This kid is so thoughtful

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm afraid to ask

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm afraid of putting pressure on him

85
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Then I was thinking

86
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,920
Could it be at school

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,840
What's the matter

88
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,440
This doesn't

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,160
I've been thinking and thinking about it

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,400
All I want is from you

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
Take a look and understand some of the situation

92
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,640
Da Gang has caused you trouble

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
No sister-in-law

94
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,920
We've been friends for so many years

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
You want to tell me about trouble

96
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
That's laughing at me

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,200
Shang Jin and I

98
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,560
I've mentioned you a lot over the years

99
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
We just don't know

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,320
You guys lived

101
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,480
Da Gang, we're doing pretty well

102
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,480
Dongdong is a sensible child

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
Don't let me worry about anything

104
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,720
Let's go

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,160
You know I have a good face

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,960
And you're Dongdong's teacher

107
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm afraid my children will know

108
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
The relationship between our two families

109
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,600
You're not easy to manage

110
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Sister-in-law or you are thoughtful

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,560
What about Ling Dong? Don't worry about it

112
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,880
The child is kind and of good character

113
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
And it's very satisfying

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,720
What about the decline in grades this time

115
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,200
Blame me

116
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
Here's the reason

117
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,120
What about Shang Jin's son

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,440
The academic performance is slightly worse

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,640
Just right

120
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,560
The two children are in the same class

121
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920
I've been thinking about it

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,520
Just built one for them

123
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,280
Study group

124
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,480
Can Ling Dong

125
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,280
Put his son's academic achievements

126
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,520
Pull it up slightly

127
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
It's going back and forth

128
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,840
These two boys are having fun

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,960
They're all like brothers

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,880
So I guess

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,000
Ling Dong this time

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,760
Maybe it was deliberately a little wrong in the exam

133
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
Want to talk to Shang Jin's son

134
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
Be assigned to a class

135
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,800
Keep helping him

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,160
If it's because of this

137
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
Let Dongdong's performance decline

138
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm not worried

139
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
By the way, Dagang

140
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:37,960
Me

141
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,040
Brought you a gift

142
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,800
This is Ling Kun and you

143
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,440
When we started the band

144
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,440
That score

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
I'll bring it over

146
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,400
Let's leave a souvenir for you

147
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,480
Sister-in-law has a heart

148
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,800
Then what

149
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
It's getting late

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
I have to go back

151
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
Dongdong may be finishing school soon

152
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,800
Sister-in-law

153
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
We haven't seen each other in so many years

154
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,200
I wanted to see you one day

155
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
When convenient

156
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,440
My name is Shangjin

157
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,320
Let's three families get together

158
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,040
OK

159
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,400
Then when there is a chance

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Okay

161
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,520
When you say this, you will wait until you have the opportunity

162
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,480
That's no chance

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560
Let's do it like this

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Let's set a time today

165
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,640
You think it's the weekend

166
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,240
Let's go down

167
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,800
Dagang

168
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
I know what you guys mean

169
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,840
But don't worry

170
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,480
We're having a really good time

171
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Nothing is lacking at home

172
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
Ling Kun can have you

173
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Such a good friend

174
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
It's his blessing

175
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,520
I thank you on his behalf

176
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
It's getting late at that time

177
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I really have to go back

178
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,720
Sister-in-law

179
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Goodbye

180
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,160
Goodbye

181
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,920
Hello

182
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,240
How about it? It's a lot of progress, right?

183
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,960
Really

184
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
But you still have to work hard

185
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,440
Get the sprint class

186
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,520
I got into the consolidation class

187
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Still a little stressful

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,240
What about you going to the consolidation class

189
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,120
Does Auntie know

190
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Aunt is in poor health

191
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,320
She

192
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,960
You won't be in a hurry

193
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Don't worry

194
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,240
My mom knows

195
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I told my mom, too

196
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,400
We're going to be admitted to Beijing University together

197
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,640
You can't make me break my word

198
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,400
Don't worry

199
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,960
Look at the second question of your question

200
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,040
This is a typical

201
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,480
conic curve

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,000
I know

203
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,440
Join a straight line with a curve

204
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,680
Then find two more simplifications

205
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
Then why don't you finish it

206
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,400
Such a big question

207
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,720
If you really can't get through it

208
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,520
There is no need to fight to death

209
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,240
A waste of time

210
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
You just have to write the formula

211
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
Finally, just take the step points

212
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
Small painting

213
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,640
Your score is so much higher than mine

214
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Is it okay

215
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,280
You're making progress too quickly

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,760
This Wheel Practice Test

217
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
We'll definitely do it

218
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
Consolidate class meetings

219
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,320
Clear day

220
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,320
Your cloze error rate

221
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,080
Still very high

222
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,640
In fact, cloze fills in the blanks

223
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,960
It's all skilled

224
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
is essentially a

225
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
The process of logical reasoning

226
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,600
The key is that you know

227
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,320
What exactly is it looking at you

228
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,760
reasoning

229
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Come on, you try

230
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,440
See if you can put this

231
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
Find out all the keywords

232
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,560
Good

233
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,720
You are already

234
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,440
The simplest sequence problem

235
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
I told you everything

236
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm not suitable for studying

237
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,480
I shouldn't be here

238
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,960
The place I should go is the basketball court

239
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,080
What am I doing here

240
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
Why go to Ma Yiming

241
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
Brother Grey, this is really not the right place for me

242
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm going to play ball

243
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,160
Bye

244
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Bye bye bye bye

245
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,680
Bye bye bye bye bye

246
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,440
Smelly brat

247
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
The bench didn't sit hot and slipped away

248
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Words

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
I have to take a mock exam again recently

250
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Take the exam every week

251
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
Get used to it as soon as possible

252
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,160
Come on, I'm worried about you

253
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm afraid you will have another problem in the exam

254
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,840
Then you'd better take care of it first

255
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
Take care of yourself

256
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm telling you seriously

257
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,240
I've been like

258
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,720
Everything you do is like a god's help

259
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
It's very smooth

260
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,720
There's nothing I can't accomplish

261
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,720
When did you

262
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,760
So thick-skinned

263
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,960
Apprentice

264
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,440
apprentice

265
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,760
I, I, I, I'm endorsing

266
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,440
The gene mutation is essentially

267
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,520
Substitution addition of base pairs

268
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,240
and deletion

269
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,240
Has she been in a daze lately

270
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,080
You also learn from others

271
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
Record more endorsements when you go back

272
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,880
Okay, there will be times when the wind and waves break

273
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
Hang the clouds and sail straight across the sea

274
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,800
Keep reciting it

275
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,480
I won't

276
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,520
Known

277
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,240
square part of cosB

278
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,880
cosA squared plus

279
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
square parts of sinB

280
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,120
sinA squared is equal to 1

281
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,440
seek verification

282
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Borrowed, borrowed, borrowed, borrowed

283
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,760
Thank you Thank you

284
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Little painting, I'm actually here

285
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm in the consolidation class

286
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,040
Let me see

287
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,920
Chen Luyang is actually still a sprint class

288
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,560
Lan Jinghui

289
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Lan Jinghui

290
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,240
I actually rushed into the sprint class

291
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,200
Ling Dong joined him again

292
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
How is this done

293
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,320
Small painting

294
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,960
Small painting

295
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,880
Small painting

296
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
You this time

297
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
Maybe I just didn't play well

298
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,320
You are usually very good

299
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,160
Is it okay

300
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,120
After passing the exam, I turned over the chapter

301
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,560
Please take a good exam next time

302
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,120
I can definitely enter the consolidation class

303
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,880
The college entrance examination is coming soon

304
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,160
I have a few more next time

305
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Ling Dong knew you would come back

306
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,320
The spot is reserved for you

307
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,000
Thanks

308
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,880
Grey Brother

309
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,760
Classmate, you seem to

310
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
Take my seat

311
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,640
Who are you

312
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,560
Ruosi

313
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,480
You don't even know him

314
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,800
The scum of our school

315
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,240
Before it was because

316
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
Someone's at the bathroom door

317
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,360
Gave him a glance

318
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,360
On a dark and windy night

319
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,680
It's raining lightly

320
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,120
He put the ten people opposite him

321
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,760
Wrong

322
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,200
Fifty people

323
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,560
Blocked at the door

324
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,760
Fixed it all over the place

325
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,320
How is it possible

326
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,280
Are you making up a story

327
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,080
Really, if you don't believe me, ask Chen Luyang

328
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,880
This is indeed the case

329
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
So you just

330
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
Did you look at him

331
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
No No No

332
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,280
I'm gonna go to the bathroom

333
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,880
fifty

334
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,360
Sunny day, what's wrong with you

335
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,880
I'm worried about the little painting

336
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,080
She clearly tried so hard

337
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,280
Why do you always fail in the exam

338
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,680
The exam doesn't just look at strength

339
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,960
Mindset is also important

340
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,760
I see your learning mentality

341
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,480
It's fine

342
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,320
I'm probably all I'm left with

343
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,880
Is this an advantage?

344
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,120
Where is there

345
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
You have many other advantages

346
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,040
What other advantages do I have

347
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,600
Optimistic and cheerful

348
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
That's not all the same

349
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,560
I'm leaving first

350
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,960
Thank you for taking me home today

351
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,040
Sorry for troubling you again

352
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
No trouble, just drop by anyway

353
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,360
Bye

354
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,840
Bye

355
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,480
What about the bus card

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Good time is up

357
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,640
Okay, apprentice

358
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,680
You only made two mistakes in multiple-choice questions

359
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,760
This accuracy rate is already very high

360
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Nice

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,560
You

362
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,840
Just putting too much pressure on yourself

363
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,600
Calm down

364
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,520
no problem

365
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,560
Next exam

366
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
You're sure to get into the consolidation class

367
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,760
It's not

368
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,440
There is obviously a problem

369
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,120
What's wrong with her

370
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,680
She probably does have some problems

371
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Why do I cry every time

372
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,080
You saw it all

373
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,240
Why don't you ask me

374
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
When you want to say

375
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,840
Naturally, you will say it

376
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,360
As long as you don't want to say

377
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
No matter how much others advise you, it's useless

378
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
I usually have no problem doing questions

379
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
But I'm nervous when it comes to the exam

380
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,040
I made mistakes in the questions that I can obviously do

381
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,440
At that time, the college entrance examination will only be worse

382
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm really scared in my heart

383
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,720
What are you afraid of

384
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm particularly afraid

385
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,360
I can't get into Beijing University

386
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,080
This is the first time I've violated

387
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,200
My mother's will

388
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,160
Chose to paint

389
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
In case you don't pass the exam

390
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm afraid she'll be disappointed

391
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,240
You couldn't possibly

392
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,800
Always satisfy them

393
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,040
You wouldn't even be able to

394
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,560
Always satisfy yourself

395
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,320
You think maybe the worst outcome

396
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
That is, you didn't get into Beijing University

397
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,000
But even so

398
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,280
You can still choose

399
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,120
Other schools

400
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,480
You can still continue to paint

401
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,440
But this is already

402
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,360
Worst Outcome

403
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,240
So

404
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
What are you afraid of

405
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,080
You seem to make sense

406
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,720
You know what

407
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
There used to be a

408
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,120
Olympic champion in long-distance running

409
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,760
He was interviewed by a reporter

410
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Ask him

411
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
What kind of perseverance do you use

412
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,280
To finish the 10,000 meters

413
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
Do you know how he answered

414
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,920
Don't know

415
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,640
He said

416
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,680
I don't know

417
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
I'm not thinking about anything

418
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,960
I just wanted to run this step

419
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,800
Then run the next step

420
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,640
That's it

421
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,880
Step by step

422
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
I've finished running before I know it

423
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,720
Step by Step

424
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,520
I've finished running before I know it

425
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,640
Xiao Xiaohua, you are the best

426
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,720
It's the best for me

427
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,840
Xiao Xiaohua

428
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,760
You will definitely be admitted to Beijing University

429
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,840
I Xiao Xiaohua

430
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,880
I will definitely be admitted to Beijing University

431
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,080
You're a campus champion

432
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,320
I'm a campus champion

433
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,160
Rooftop Squad

434
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,600
Go ahead

435
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,280
I hear you're Ma Mao's girlfriend

436
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,840
Ma Mao gambled with us some time ago

437
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,600
lost money

438
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,120
Do you have to pay it back for him

439
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,360
I don't know him

440
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,600
Don't know

441
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,600
I heard Ma Mao say it myself

442
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,880
Are you Xu Mengyu

443
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,280
Yeah, that's her

444
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,360
Last time at the basketball hall

445
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,280
It's you who I see

446
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,080
What are you pretending to be

447
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,040
I don't know him

448
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,760
You don't recognize it

449
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,840
Don't go, I'm telling you

450
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,080
Don't go

451
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,480
Let me go

452
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,480
Don't go anywhere without money

453
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,760
Did you hear me

454
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,360
What's the sound

455
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
Like Ma Yiming

456
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,640
Is that Ma Yiming

457
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,040
Ma Yiming

458
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,680
What's wrong

459
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,960
Grey Brother Grey Brother

460
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,720
What's wrong

461
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,440
They're looking for trouble with Mengyu

462
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Are you okay

463
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,680
What's wrong in such a hurry

464
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,160
Lan Jinghui

465
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,920
Go away if you don't want to get into trouble

466
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm looking for her alone

467
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm welcome to you

468
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,680
You kicked your nose on your face, didn't you

469
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,400
You know my name is Lan Jinghui

470
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,280
Still talking to me like that

471
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,360
You don't know

472
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,680
Am I just looking for trouble

473
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,640
Bullying girls

474
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
Who are you

475
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,320
Looking for me

476
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,520
What's the matter what's the matter

477
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,440
You're not convinced when you have a helper, are you

478
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,520
refuse to accept refuse to accept

479
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,120
Unacceptable unacceptable unacceptable unacceptable unacceptable unacceptable

480
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,360
OK

481
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,240
There are a lot of you, aren't you

482
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
You guys just wait for me

483
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Come

484
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,680
I thought

485
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,440
What's so great about bad guys

486
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
Lan Jinghui, where's your bag

487
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,320
And here

488
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
My mother bought me a bag

489
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,680
What about the new one

490
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
Scared me to death

491
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,480
We're amazing

492
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,800
Actually, you didn't have to send me back

493
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,640
I can myself

494
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,160
I'm afraid those people will come to you again

495
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,360
You asked me before

496
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,960
Which volunteer do you want to apply for

497
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,920
I didn't think about it

498
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
But I have a goal now

499
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,400
I want to be admitted to Chengdu University

500
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,000
Rongda

501
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
I've been thinking about it for a long time

502
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,760
I think

503
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,120
I still enjoy writing

504
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,480
I want to be admitted to the drama and literature department of Chengdu University

505
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,280
This major

506
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,760
It is the ace major of Chengdu University

507
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,800
However, the requirements for scores

508
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,560
Also very high

509
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,440
I don't know if I can do it

510
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
You must be fine

511
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
If you fail the exam

512
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,200
Then who can pass the exam

513
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,800
Is it not

514
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,040
My house is not far ahead

515
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,760
Thank you for sending me back

516
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,560
It's okay

517
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,680
See you tomorrow

518
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,840
See you tomorrow

519
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,840
Ma Yiming

520
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,920
Thank you for today

521
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,520
It's okay

522
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,120
How many scores do you need to get in the Chengdu University exam?

523
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
Look at this question

524
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,280
Don't tell you

525
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,720
You weren't there during the exam

526
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,840
Do I have to rely on myself

527
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,720
You can't help me forever

528
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,080
Is there anyone here

529
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Here are the notes I have compiled

530
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,160
If you don't understand

531
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,800
You can ask me

532
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,520
Ma Yiming

533
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,480
The world is undecided

534
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,160
You and I are both dark horses

535
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,360
Real or false

536
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,920
Really

537
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,760
Jia Letian

538
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,560
Can you stop spreading rumors

539
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,000
I obviously lost weight, okay

540
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,520
Pity

541
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,920
This is not us anymore

542
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,440
The original arrangement of Class 5, Grade 2, High School

543
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,480
We're never gonna go back, are we

544
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,480
Who said that

545
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,280
You see

546
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,720
Our position is still there

547
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,520
Everyone is still there

548
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,040
We can still play together, right

549
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,120
Attend class

550
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Stand up

551
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,840
Hello teacher

552
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,720
All right, classmates, please sit down

553
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,120
Long time no see everyone

554
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,800
Long time no see

555
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,280
The college entrance examination is coming soon

556
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,960
There are some points I still want

557
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,000
Let me explain to everyone

558
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,960
ID card and admission ticket

559
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Everyone, don't forget

560
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,080
Especially those

561
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,840
A classmate who likes to lose everything

562
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,160
Jia Letian

563
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,920
Don't look, I'm talking about you

564
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,360
Of course there are some

565
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,360
Easily nervous at ordinary times

566
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,080
Students prone to emotional anxiety

567
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,680
It doesn't matter

568
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,640
It's no big deal

569
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
You've all been there

570
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,200
Thousands of exams in Qian Qian

571
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:47,760
Is that right

572
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,440
Right

573
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,120
Good

574
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,320
According to the usual practice

575
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,480
The teacher still gives it to you

576
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,120
Brought a gift

577
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,760
Make papers again

578
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,080
Easy harvest

579
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Good

580
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Students who heard their names

581

582
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,720

593
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,720
Thank you Teacher Fang

594
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,720
Ling Dong

595
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,680
The paper looks a little familiar

596
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,160
Done

597
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,000
Everyone has got it

598
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,640
Have you got the test paper

599
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Got it

600
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,360
This is your sophomore year in high school

601
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,000
The bottom test paper at the time of admission

602
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Think about it

603
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,800
How do you do it yourself

604
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,440
These topics

605
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,160
I was really stupid at that time

606
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,120
Such a simple question can be done wrong

607
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,040
What about this paper

608
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,720
Confirmed you

609
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,840
Changes in two years

610
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,240
Remember

611
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
You've all been there

612
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,480
Thousands of exams in Qian Qian

613
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,840
So next

614
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,800
You have to be in your best shape

615
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Fight the most beautiful battle

616
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The college entrance examination is coming soon

617
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,120
The teacher nagged a few last words

618
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,480
Students are leaving soon

619
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,360
This classroom

620
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
You know, in mathematics

621
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,600
There is a very gentle word

622
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,000
Call there and only

623
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,360
So in the past few years in Chen County

624
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,400
That is, you have

625
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,800
And the only time of youth

626
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,640
In the past few years

627
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
You sweat

628
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,480
Overflowing with youth

629
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,800
It's also us

630
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,000
Years of Together Growth

631
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,400
Maybe the last few years we've been getting along

632
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,560
Not so smooth

633
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,160
Because I keep criticizing you

634
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,160
But

635
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,920
I want to say

636
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm reluctant to leave you

637
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,800
You guys are like my friends

638
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Like my teacher

639
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,440
I grew up with you guys

640
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,000
Youth is a column

641
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
A train that won't turn back

642
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
I'm honored to be a part of

643
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
Your best flower season

644
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,520
Accompany you through

645
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,120
Just the years of classmates and teenagers

646
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,160
What about the future

647
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,360
I never got another chance

648
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,560
I took you to the tour

649
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
And no one will be outside the classroom

650
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,240
Watch you secretly

651
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,080
Did you sleep

652
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
And I wouldn't suddenly

653
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,480
Suddenly walk into the classroom

654
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,680
Take away your cell phones

655
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,320
But I wish you all

656
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,600
Every day after that

657
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,600
You can be healthy and happy

658
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,320
Harvesting

659
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,640
I hope your youth

660
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,560
Don't have regrets

661
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,120
Come on for the college entrance examination

662
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,320
Good

663
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Next I announce

664
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,440
Class 5, Senior Three

665
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,640
The last lesson

666
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,840
After the class

667
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,320
Stand up

668
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,840
Goodbye teacher

669
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,320
Goodbye students

670
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,000
Let's find a classmate

671
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,960
Take an interview

672
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,880
Hello classmate

673
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,040
Can I interview you

674
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
Yes, yes, yes

675
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,720
Excuse me, what do you have to say

676
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,120
I want to say to my high school self

677
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,760
I want to say

678
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,560
It's against this lens

679
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,000
Then face

680
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,680

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,200
Yes, yes, right

682
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,720
Good

683
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,040
Let me think about it

684
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,160
Hello

For the first time in my life, I became

Role models for others

690
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
Do you feel particularly proud

691
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,600
Particularly proud

692
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,160
I allow you to be proud

693
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,000

There's still a lot to gain, right

707
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,080
What did you gain

708
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,360
harvested

709
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,440
A very good group of friends

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,320
Like that

720
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,080
Save money for sneakers

721
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,160
Okay, okay, you're done

722
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,040
Chen Luyang, tell me

723
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,600
I didn't finish

724
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Are you done

725
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,560
Be careful

726
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,280
Let me say

727
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,000
I think my high school

728
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,840
The biggest change

729
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,840
That is

730
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,880
My life is full of sunny days

731
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,720
Give

732
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,840
Summer sunny day

You're amazing

734
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,000
Finally under the leadership of the monitor

735
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,920
Your math score

736
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,200
Over your weight

737
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,600
That's all you got in math

738
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,560
What are you talking about

739
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,240
Sister Lai Meng, tell me

740
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,960
Xu Mengyu

741
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,520
Be down-to-earth occasionally

742
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,320
There's nothing wrong with it

743
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,520
After all

744
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,880
It's someone who will have fans in the future

745
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
Come, come, come, come

Come and say a few words

749
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,920
I

750
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,080
Been standing on the edge for half a day

751
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,760
Say a few words

752
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,000
There's so much I want to say

753
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,200
Don't know what to say

754
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,400
Then you say what you want to say most

755
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,720
Xiao Xiaohua in high school

756
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,520
You are the one in this world

757
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,320
A unique existence

758
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,920
Draw firmly

759
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,800
Your own color
