Bright Time EP18

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,040
Folks at the frontline, and friends,

4
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
at this moment, we express our gratitude

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
to those still committed to their jobs

6
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,400
across all sectors.

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,720
Friends...

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
Dong, you're back.

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,240
Good evening, ma'am.

10
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,440
Happy

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,600
New Year!

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Madam,

13
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
you look very familiar,

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,000
and seem amiable.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,040
Thanks, you're so sweet.

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
It must be destiny.

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,000
I feel like I've seen you before.

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,120
Oh, really?

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
Well, Dong,

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,200
there are fruits and snacks.

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
Have a sit.

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
I'll go make dumplings for you.

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,080
Don't bother,

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
we just had dinner.

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,120
You did?

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
We had dumplings.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,920
Mom, please. I'm hungry.

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,720
Help yourself.

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Okay.

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
Make yourself at home.

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,560
Thank you.

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,360
Change your shoes.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,800
Nothing beats your mom's dumplings.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,880
They taste completely

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,360
different from

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,840
what I made.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,920
Dong,

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,240
you guys eat.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
After that, go take a shower.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,520
Tomorrow is the first day

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
of the New Year,

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,560
you should start it fresh and clean.

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Madam, I'd rather not shower.

44
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
I didn't bring pajamas.

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,640
What's there to worry about?

46
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,120
You can wear Dong's.

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
No, Mom. No way.

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Come on,

49
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,720
isn't Jinghui

50
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,840
your good friend?

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,960
Be kind.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,240
Thanks, Madam.

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,320
Mom,

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
wait a sec, let me finish eating.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,760
I'll make the bed.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
No, I'll do it.

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,080
No way!

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,160
How could you,

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
as a guest, do this?

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
It's fine.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,200
How about

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,840
you two boys share the bed?

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
It's quite big.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,320
Can we?

66
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,440
Sure, it's settled.

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,200
Forget the couch.

68
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,080
Eat more, Jinghui.

69
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,400
Okay.

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,720
You don't hog the bed, do you?

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Of course not,

72
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,160
I never do that.

73
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,320
And do you snore?

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
No.

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,120
Never!

76
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,320
It's so cold.

77
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,320
Jinghui,

78
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,240
come on,

79
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,320
eat now

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
before the food gets cold.

81
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,440
Thank you.

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,120
This is for you.

83
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,080
What a feast!

84
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,040
This fish,

85
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,360
Dong made it.

86
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,680
His cooking is better than mine.

87
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Try it.

88
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,760
You made this?

89
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,840
How's it?

90
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
It's pretty good.

91
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,040
Of course.

92
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,720
At least you won't starve

93
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,520
as a cook.

94
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,600
Absolutely.

95
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,640
Madam,

96
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
since you and Ling Dong cook,

97
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,040
I can't just eat for free.

98
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
I'll wash the dishes later.

99
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,400
No, you're our guest.

100
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,360
Eat more fish,

101
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,480
it's good for the brain.

102
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,840
You

103
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
need nutrition for school.

104
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,320
Eat more.

105
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,920
You too.

106
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,000
Right, not only is your brain slow,

107
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,800
but your feet stink.

108
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,480
Rumors,

109
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
complete nonsense!

110
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
You can say my brain is slow,

111
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,720
but stinky feet are just your nose

112
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,720
being too sensitive.

113
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I'm just being honest.

114
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Ignore him, ma'am, have more food.

115
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,840
Jinghui,

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,440
is there a tear

117
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,240
under the sleeve

118
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,240
of your elbow?

119
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,600
Where?

120
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Pull it back, see?

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,280
Look, isn't it?

122
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,320
Oh, yes.

123
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,280
It's okay,

124
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,760
might've ripped it

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,960
playing basketball.

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,920
I didn't notice.

127
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
I'll just throw this away

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,840
and get a new one.

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,520
Don't.

130
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,440
I can

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
sew it up later.

132
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,880
Let's eat.

133
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,000
Have more.

134
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,360
Enjoy it.

135
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Dong, you eat more too.

136
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,200
Okay.

137
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,360
Jinghui, if you like it,

138
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
come over more often.

139
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,080
That's cool.

140
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,520
Hold on,

141
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,680
don't move.

142
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,760
Can you hear the ocean?

143
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,080
Yes, I hear the echo of wisdom.

144
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
Shouldn't it all be water?

145
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,480
How could it be?

146
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
I know what you mean by water.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,360
The sea of knowledge.

148
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,960
Can't tell at all.

149
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,240
Mom, here you are.

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,160
Jinghui,

151
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,200
I don't think your shirt

152
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
can keep you warm.

153
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,480
It may just look good.

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,960
No, ma'am...

155
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
it can.

156
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,520
I didn't feel cold.

157
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,240
That's right,

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,800
you young boys

159
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,640
are full of energy.

160
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
Dong sometimes doesn't wear the clothes

161
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
I bought him 'cause he feels hot.

162
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
When did this happen?

163
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,840
Remember

164
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,160
the thermal underwear

165
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
I bought you?

166
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
You never wore it.

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,240
I was worried you'd be cold,

168
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
even got you

169
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,360
the thick kind.

170
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,520
Are you asleep?

171
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't sleep.

172
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,880
Counting sheep then.

173
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,440
My grandma's coming back tomorrow.

174
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,240
Thank God.

175
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
You're finally leaving.

176
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm gonna

177
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
have a nervous breakdown.

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,720
Would you stop saying that?

179
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,680
Exaggerating.

180
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,160
Didn't you complain about the hot water

181
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
and hard bed?

182
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,080
Hurry up and leave.

183
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,040
But, to be honest,

184
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,600
I really like

185
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
staying at your place.

186
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,240
It feels just like home.

187
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,280
Goodnight.

188
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,600
Sweetheart,

189
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,840
did you miss me?

190
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,800
Of course,

191
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,160
I missed you so much.

192
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,240
Your dad had to

193
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
go abroad for work,

194
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,320
left early this morning.

195
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,040
Who cares about him?

196
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,080
Let's go inside.

197
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,720
Come on, Grandma.

198
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,880
I'll carry that.

199
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,720
It's okay.

200
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
Let's go.

201
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
You look like you've lost weight.

202
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,400
No,

203
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,840
I've been well taken care of by my friend.

204
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,480
You definitely haven't eaten properly.

205
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,160
No! I have!

206
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
My friend cooked for me.

207
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,680
Look at you...

208
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,520
Jinghui!

209
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,040
Jinghui.

210
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,720
Hi, Ma Yiming.

211
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,080
Did you miss me?

212
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,600
Disgusting.

213
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,120
Jinghui,

214
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,480
you've changed.

215
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,120
What's wrong?

216
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,560
You don't love me anymore.

217
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,800
Get away.

218
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Jinghui.

219
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,560
Ling Dong,

220
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,040
here's the breakfast I brought you.

221
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
Have a try.

222
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:45,920
Thanks.

223
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,400
How is it? Good?

224
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,600
Yeah.

225
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
What would you like

226
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,680
for tomorrow?

227
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Thanks, but I can buy it myself.

228
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,800
No worries, there are

229
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
many breakfast stores around my home.

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,400
I see,

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,680
well, thanks then.

232
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,360
By the way,

233
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,160
have you finished your homework?

234
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,080
Yes.

235
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,560
There are 2 questions

236
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,960
that are easy to get wrong.

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,760
I can

238
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,800
help you have a check.

239
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,480
Okay.

240
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,200
Sometimes,

241
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,560
making sacrifices

242
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,920
for others is a virtue, right?

243
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,360
What are you talking about?

244
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,880
I didn't get it.

245
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
You'll understand when you're older.

246
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,760
Why are you

247
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,480
picking on your apprentice again?

248
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,120
How is this picking on her?

249
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,560
If she wasn't apprenticed to me,

250
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,520
would I do this to her?

251
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's go play basketball.

252
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,160
Go ahead.

253
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,360
Keke,

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
have you seen the new movie?

255
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,360
No, is it good?

256
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,920
It's fantastic.

257
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,760
I'm telling you,

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,920
it's definitely the best one

259
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
I've seen this year.

260
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,320
Who did you go with?

261
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,040
My mom.

262
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
It was so awkward.

263
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,640
Oh my gosh,

264
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,000
shouldn't it

265
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
be watched with someone you like?

266
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,400
Exactly.

267
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,520
I'm so jealous of those

268
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,280
who went to see it together.

269
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,720
Lan Jinghui, what are you doing?

270
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,960
Today's sunlight is so nice,

271
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:35,920
isn't it?

272
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm serious,

273
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,960
that movie is amazing.

274
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,760
A Must-Watch for Couples!

275
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,640
This one?

276
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,560
Saturday night at 7:30 p.m.,

277
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,040
two tickets side by side.

278
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,520
Done.

279
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
Good morning, Xiaohua.

280
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,480
Your breakfast.

281
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,240
Since you bring me

282
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,920
good food every morning,

283
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,520
as your master,

284
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,360
I want to tell you

285
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,000
some good news.

286
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
I don't care

287
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
about which team won

288
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,160
or who was the

289
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,960
MVP.

290
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Not about basketball!

291
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,800
It's about Ling Dong.

292
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,560
What's wrong with him?

293
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,480
He...

294
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
wants to invite you to a movie.

295
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,200
But he's too shy to say so.

296
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,600
So he asked me to do it.

297
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
I had to

298
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
help him out.

299
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
Good news, right?

300
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
Anyway, the ticket code

301
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,200
has been sent to you.

302
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,680
Don't be late!

303
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,200
Beauty in common things.

304
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,920
Beauty in common things.

305
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,520
Each different part of China.

306
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,000
Each different part of China.

307
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,160
Let's go watch a movie this weekend.

308
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,200
Why?

309
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
The latest release. Don't miss it.

310
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
Tell me the reason.

311
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,320
Just a regular

312
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
team-building activity.

313
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,280
Why so many questions?

314
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,440
Will you join me?

315
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,520
I've bought tickets.

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,840
Will you finish your homework?

317
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,120
Yes, I promise.

318
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,840
Okay, send me the ticket code.

319
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,200
Got it.

320
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,520
The most common things.

321
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,040
The most common things.

322
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,240
Excuse me.

323
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,520
Excuse me.

324
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,840
Sorry.

325
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,440
Hi, Ling Dong.

326
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,000
Xiaohua?

327
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:48,880
You...

328
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Sorry, bro,

329
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,800
I was caught up

330
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,720
in an unexpected situation.

331
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,360
So I gave the ticket to Xiao Xiaohua.

332
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,000
Tell me the plots later, okay?

333
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,360
The movie's on.

334
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,760
Such a good movie,

335
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,840
I can't miss it.

336
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,400
Hi, Luyang.

337
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,320
Qingtian, you're here.

338
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,320
When you invited me out today,

339
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,400
I thought you wanted

340
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,800
to help me with my studies.

341
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
I didn't expect a movie.

342
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
I'm gonna go get popcorn.

343
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,800
It's still early,

344
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,680
let's go somewhere first.

345
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:22,960
Let's go!

346
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Okay.

347
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,960
Ready for my show?

348
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,480
One more time.

349
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
You can do it.

350
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
You can do it!

351
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,320
Forget it.

352
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,920
I just don't have luck with it.

353
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's go back for the movie.

354
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,800
Wait,

355
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,200
I'll help you.

356
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,880
That one, the panda.

357
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,680
It's normal not to catch it.

358
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,240
That's how they make money.

359
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,440
Let's go watch the movie.

360
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,080
No, today I'll get you one.

361
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,640
I must!

362
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,240
Wait for me.

363
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,560
Lan Jinghui!

364
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,680
Lan Jinghui!

365
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
Don't think we don't know

366
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
what you're thinking.

367
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,440
How can you do this?

368
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
To get what you want,

369
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,880
you'll do anything!

370
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,280
You dare to call yourself

371
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,080
"Captain Chenjun"?

372
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
You dare to call yourself

373
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,320
a student from Class 5?

374
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,080
You dare to

375
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
let me call you master?

376
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,240
You're despicable, shameless!

377
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,760
Despicable!

378
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
Shameless!

379
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,440
Despicable!

380
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,680
Shameless!

381
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,040
Shameless!

382
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,080
May I ask

383
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,000
when can we leave?

384
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,240
I must do

385
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,320
what I promised you.

386
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,440
You spent enough

387
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,200
to buy twenty dolls.

388
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,120
We've been at it all night.

389
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
I got it!

390
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,560
I got it!

391
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,880
It's so ugly!

392
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,280
No, no.

393
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
I want to get your favorite one.

394
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,040
No need!

395
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,360
One more time.

396
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,640
This one is good enough.

397
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,760
Really?

398
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,720
But...

399
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,480
Stop it. This is good.

400
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,200
We spent all night,

401
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
even missed the movie.

402
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,800
I've always been asked

403
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,280
to do my best.

404
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,480
And then,

405
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,600
I got used to it.

406
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,480
Just be yourself, don't force it.

407
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Be carefree, like me.

408
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,280
I'll get another ticket.

409
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
I just said,

410
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
be carefree

411
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,520
like me.

412
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,200
Okay.

413
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,040
What do we do next?

414
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,520
Tired. Let's go home.

415
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,520
Morning, Xiaohua.

416
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Where's my breakfast?

417
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,480
Xiaohua,

418
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,680
where's my breakfast?

419
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,560
Ling Dong,

420
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
how was the movie?

421
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
Good, right?

422
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,200
Do you like it?

423
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,840
Wait,

424
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
why are you ignoring me?

425
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,400
Hello?

426
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,840
Hi?

427
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,240
C'mon!

428
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,360
Xiaohua.

429
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,840
Xiaohua?

430
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,840
Xiao Xiaohua!

431
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,600
It was my bad.

432
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
I was wrong.

433
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,040
I really had something to do yesterday.

434
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,920
That's why I didn't show up.

435
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,600
Okay?

436
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,200
Childish.

437
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,080
Xiaohua...

438
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,120
Don't do this again!

439
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,760
You made me...

440
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,880
Made you what?

441
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,160
Nothing!

442
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,920
Then where's my breakfast?

443
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,240
Depends on you.

444
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,040
Wait,

445
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,120
Xiaohua...

446
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,200
save me an egg white,

447
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,680
or you can leave me the yolk.

448
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,680
You aren't taking your bags.

449
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,440
Where are you going?

450
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,000
No one's grateful.

451
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,880
Good intentions wasted!

452
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,760
Hmph!

453
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,120
Grandma, I'm back.

454
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,760
Finally, you're back!

455
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,240
Wash your hands for dinner.

456
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
Tired from studying?

457
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,880
Why do you look so down?

458
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,880
Nothing.

459
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Maybe because I'm hungry.

460
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,640
Grandma, what's for dinner?

461
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
All your favorite dishes.

462
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Your dad's back too.

463
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,000
He's in the study.

464
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,960
Go call him down for dinner.

465
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,040
My good boy.

466
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,800
Go now.

467
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,760
Remember

468
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
to transfer money to the school today.

469
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,480
Ling Dong

470
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,320
is a good kid.

471
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,400
He's been doing his best

472
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,200
to help Jinghui with

473
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
with his studies.

474
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
So make sure the money

475
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,800
is transferred on time.

476
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,840
I shouldn't have to

477
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,880
remind you.

478
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,120
Don't forget it.

479
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay.

480
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,480
Morning, Jinghui.

481
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,040
You're here.

482
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,640
Do these first.

483
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,240
I'll explain if you get them wrong.

484
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,040
Don't wanna do it.

485
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:13,920
What's wrong?

486
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Nothing.

487
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
Do I need a reason?

488
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,760
You have to do...

489
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,680
I'm out.

490
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,600
Ma Yiming, let's go for a walk.

491
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,360
It's too stuffy here.

492
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,480
Can't stay another minute.

493
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,160
Wait!

494
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
Do I need a reason?

495
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,400
Leave me alone.

496
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,920
Let's go.

497
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,320
Let's go.

498
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,840
Jinghui.

499
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,440
Jinghui!

500
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,360
What's up? Are you arguing?

501
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,720
What's wrong with Lan Jinghui?

502
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,360
No idea.

503
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,360
Why did you...

504
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,160
Are you here?

505
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,360
Morning.

506
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,800
Morning.

507
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,280
I've marked the

508
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,120
key points.

509
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,760
Check them out.

510
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
It's upside down.

511
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,560
You just asked me to read,

512
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,400
but didn't mention how to hold it.

513
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,880
Do this worksheet today.

514
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
See you in the study room after school.

515
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,880
On purpose?

516
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,160
Nope.

517
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,200
You told me to do it, so I did.

518
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,160
I don't know why you're

519
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,560
suddenly acting like a kid.

520
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,240
I don't have to

521
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,160
help you if you

522
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,200
don't want.

523
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,880
This attitude helps no one.

524
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,080
Lan Jinghui,

525
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,800
you finally made

526
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,360
some progress.

527
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,920
Giving up now?

528
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,720
I'm telling you,

529
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,520
studying is

530
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,480
your responsibility.

531
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,280
If you don't want to learn,

532
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,120
no one can help you!

533
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,720
Listen!

534
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,160
This is

535
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,280
my own business!

536
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
It has nothing to do with you!

537
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,280
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

538
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,120
Ling Dong!

539
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,440
Ling Dong!

540
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,120
Ling Dong!

541
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,480
What's up?

542
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,600
It's getting cold!

543
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,640
Just wait for a few seconds.

544
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,280
It's okay.

545
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,440
Ling Dong!

546
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,960
Ling Dong!

547
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,080
What again?

548
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,720
Towel!

549
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,960
Don't use mine.

550
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,040
I'll give you another one.

551
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,840
Which one is yours?

552
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,760
Are they all yours?

553
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,280
I told you not to use mine!

554
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,520
I'll give you another one.

555
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,560
What's the big deal?

556
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
I'm so handsome.
