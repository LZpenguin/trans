00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,120
Bright Time EP25

3
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,480
Everyone, what you have in front of you is

4
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,920
the college application preference form.

5
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,720
As per our school's custom,

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
you can all choose the university

7
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,200
that you aspire to attend.

8
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,840
And then,

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,320
you should focus on this goal

10
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,240
and redouble your efforts.

11
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,480
Ms. Fang,

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,720
when do we need to submit it?

13
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,920
There's no hurry.

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,920
However,

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
I do hope that all of you

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
will think it over carefully at home,

17
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,440
fill it out based on your capabilities,

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,480
and then submit it

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
to the class rep.

20
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,760
They will be posted by next Monday.

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,680
That'll be all.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
I'm aiming for Jing University!

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,960
That's wishful thinking!

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,920
Mom.

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Hey,

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,720
Dong, welcome back.

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,600
Yeah, I'm back.

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Mom, come on,

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,360
I'll take care of it.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,480
It's OK.

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,280
Why don't you

32
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
watch some TV for now?

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,120
Dinner will be

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,920
ready shortly.

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,800
Dong, wash your hands and eat.

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,720
What are you...

37
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,880
Er...

38
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Mom,

39
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,600
what's happening?

40
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,920
Are you not feeling well again?

41
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,480
Look at you,

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,400
so young

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,600
yet always so inquisitive.

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,160
It's nothing serious.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
It might just be a slight cold

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,800
from changing season.

47
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,560
It's truly nothing.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,880
Don't worry about it.

49
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,400
Then why didn't you tell me?

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,040
If I had told you,

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,920
you would have asked more questions.

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,040
It's really nothing.

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
Really?

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,320
Honestly, it's nothing.

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,920
I know my own health

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,280
better than anyone.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,360
Don't fret.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,360
Alright, Mom,

59
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,400
I'll be home early for the next few days.

60
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,800
I'll take care of whatever

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
needs to be done at home.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You just take a break.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,200
Got it, alright.

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Look at you,

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
you're so young

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,560
yet you worry so much.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,600
Come on,

68
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,360
let's eat.

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,120
Look,

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,520
what delicious dishes Mom has made?

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,640
Your favorite,

72
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,520
tomato and scrambled eggs.

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
Come on, sit down,

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,440
let's eat.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,240
I...I'm scared...

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
What's there to be scared of?

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,080
Go ahead and check.

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,600
You check it.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,680
No, you check it.

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,880
Fine, I'll do it.

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,200
What's the matter?

82
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,840
I didn't pass, did I?

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,360
Why is it this score?

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,720
I knew it, I definitely...

85
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
You passed.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,760
I passed...

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
I passed?

88
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,040
You've scored

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,800
over 30 points above the cut-off score.

90
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,400
I've always said,

91
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,520
you could do it.

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,000
Does this mean

93
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
I am able to apply to Jing University?

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,360
Yes!

95
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,240
Halt!

96
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,960
Alright.

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
To celebrate Xiao Xiaohua's

98
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,480
success in the exam

99
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
and the first step on her great journey,

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,160
let's go out and

101
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
celebrate after school tonight.

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,760
Absolutely!

103
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,960
Let's hit up a spicy pot place!

104
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,720
Spicy hot pot!

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Spicy pot!

106
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,240
Hot pot!

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,040
Spicy pot!

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,760
Hot pot!

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,280
We'll have both.

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,440
You guys go have fun tonight.

111
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,520
I've got other plans.

112
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,600
Why is it that at times like this,

113
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,440
you always have to act

114
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
like a top student?

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,960
Are you planning to

116
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,120
sneak off home to hit the books?

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,560
Are you

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,240
trying to get ahead of us?

119
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm telling you, it's not happening!

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,640
No,

121
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,080
I do need to take care of something.

122
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,240
Come on,

123
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,840
how long

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,800
can dinner take?

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,600
It's OK, it's OK.

126
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
I need to head home early today too.

127
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
To share the good news with my parents.

128
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,880
Let's do it next time.

129
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,360
Alright then.

130
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,400
Let's hooray for it one more time!

131
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,880
Look at this kid, so cute.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,520
Look, look, impressive, right?

133
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,680
Reminds me of you when you were younger.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,240
Look at her, how adorable.

135
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,240
When I was young,

136
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
I was just as adorable.

137
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,840
You were way cuter than her.

138
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,080
Look, so adorable.

139
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,880
Indeed.

140
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,480
It takes me back to my childhood.

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Mr. Xiao Datu,

142
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Mrs. Guo Ying,

143
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,040
your daughter

144
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,600
has an important announcement to make.

145
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,200
Move aside, move aside.

146
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,320
We're just getting to the good part.

147
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,560
Come on, move.

148
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,400
Hey!

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,960
Is the show more important,

150
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,240
or is your daughter more important?

151
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,680
Your daughter passed her exam.

152
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,160
I scored 30 points above the pass mark.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Oh.

154
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,480
Oh.

155
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,840
Is that it?

156
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,760
That's it?

157
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,680
Just that?

158
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
That's your reaction?

159
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,880
What else?

160
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,520
Alright, go back to your room and rest.

161
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,160
Don't you think that passing the art tests

162
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,400
means you can skip the academic exams.

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,720
Don't interrupt our TV time.

164
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,240
Seriously.

165
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,840
Where were we?

166
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,480
So funny!

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,200
Yeah!

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
Oh dear.

169
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,280
Our daughter,

170
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,400
she might be so touched that she's crying.

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,280
It's very likely.

172
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
We artists do

173
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,080
have deep emotions.

174
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,320
When did you prepare all this?

175
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,520
This afternoon.

176
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,680
Your mom checked your results,

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
and she took me to buy all these.

178
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,840
Look!

179
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,880
She's never bought me

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,800
such expensive paints before,

181
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,720
nor brushes!

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Can you compare with our daughter?

183
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,640
Our daughter is so talented.

184
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,760
Unlike you, neglecting your duties.

185
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,600
Mom,

186
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm so happy you support me

187
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,560
in chasing my dream.

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,320
Sweetie,

189
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,640
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.

190
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,640
You have a long journey ahead,

191
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,120
and there's so much you can do.

192
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,440
So,

193
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
your dad and I just want you to be happy.

194
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,480
Doing what you love

195
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,920
is the most blissful thing.

196
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,960
We have our limitations.

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,240
The rest is up to you.

198
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
Dad, mom,

199
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,200
I promise I'll work hard

200
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720
and not disappoint you.

201
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,560
I love rainy days.

202
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,320
The umbrellas of different colors

203
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
are like little dancing figures.

204
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,680
Rain and hoops, a perfect match.

205
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,280
How do you play basketball on a rainy day?

206
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,600
There's indoor basketball.

207
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,080
Basketball gym?

208
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,480
Mom,

209
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
I've prepared breakfast.

210
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,920
I'm heading to school now.

211
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,240
Mom.

212
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,240
Mom?

213
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,160
Mom.

214
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,200
Mom, what's wrong?

215
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,080
Are you not feeling well?

216
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,320
Stay still, I'll grab your meds.

217
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm fine now.

218
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm fine.

219
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,920
I just got up

220
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,200
too fast earlier

221
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,640
and felt a bit dizzy.

222
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,800
It might be low blood pressure.

223
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,400
I feel much better now.

224
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,880
No, Mom,

225
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,960
please listen to me.

226
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm going to take the day off today,

227
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,800
and I'll take you to the hospital.

228
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,840
I've already told you, I'm fine.

229
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,760
Look, I am

230
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,840
feeling quite good now, right?

231
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,760
You should go to school today.

232
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,200
We'll go for a check-up this weekend.

233
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't be late today.

234
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,480
Go to school, come on.

235
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm fine.

236
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,200
I'll be all right soon.

237
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Then...

238
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,240
Don't go to work today.

239
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,440
Just take a day off.

240
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,560
Call me if you need anything.

241
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,240
OK, I promise you.

242
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,760
Go on, don't be late for school.

243
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,560
Make sure to call me

244
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,080
if anything happens.

245
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,120
OK, just go.

246
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,760
Well, I'm off then.

247
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,400
Go on, go on.

248
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,480
Go.

249
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,880
Rest up, OK?

250
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,280
Don't worry.

251
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,400
Off you go.

252
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,040
Gosh, so many!

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,960
What schools are these?

254
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,440
These are all prestigious.

255
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,640
Rousi, which school are you applying?

256
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,680
Me?

257
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,960
I don't want to go too far from home.

258
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,400
How about Rong University?

259
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,800
Rong University?

260
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,960
That one is pretty good too.

261
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,560
Many majors demand high entry.

262
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Let's give our best shot!

263
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,200
Yes!

264
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,360
Xiaohua, you're so impressive!

265
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,160
Aiming for Jing University's art program.

266
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,280
God!

267
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Maybe she was just filling it out for fun.

268
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,960
Did you see Lan Jinghui

269
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,720
also chose Jing University?

270
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,240
You think I can't make it, Liu Shu?

271
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,400
Jing University isn't

272
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,520
just any university.

273
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
If it were that easy,

274
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
would it still be Jing University?

275
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
You're really concerned about me, huh?

276
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,520
How odd.

277
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,200
Odd about what?

278
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Ling Dong, he...

279
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Ling Dong.

280
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
That geek didn't fill it out.

281
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,640
Where is he?

282
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,360
Why didn't he fill it out?

283
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,480
He didn't put any school in there.

284
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,000
He hasn't filled it out yet.

285
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,640
It makes no difference if he fills it out.

286
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,080
Hello?

287
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,280
Auntie Ma,

288
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
is my mom with you?

289
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,040
No.

290
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,680
Your mom isn't with me.

291
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,920
Is there a problem?

292
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,000
No, no, it's nothing.

293
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,600
Got it.

294
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Next class is about to start.

295
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,640
Where are you off to?

296
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
I've got to take care of something.

297
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,200
Could you let the teacher know about it?

298
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,080
What's so urgent?

299
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,640
Mom.

300
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,920
Mom!

301
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,360
Mom, what's wrong?

302
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,920
Mom. Mom!

303
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,160
Mom! Mom!

304
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
How long has she been unconscious?

305
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm not exactly sure.

306
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,160
We need to conduct

307
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,080
further tests.

308
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,840
Take it easy.

309
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,840
Please wait outside.

310
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,400
Mom.

311
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,600
Why hasn't Dad come out yet?

312
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,840
Why did you come?

313
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,440
You left in such a rush.

314
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,000
I was worried.

315
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't worry,

316
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,680
she will be fine.

317
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,680
Thank you.

318
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,160
Doctor, how is she doing?

319
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
Thankfully, you got her here in time.

320
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,640
She's out of danger now.

321
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,080
But,

322
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,720
we do suggest

323
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,320
she stays in for observation for a while.

324
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,440
Her condition is mainly

325
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,640
due to excessive fatigue.

326
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,520
She needs to rest more regularly,

327
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,360
OK?

328
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,920
OK.

329
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,920
You're her son, right?

330
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Please go complete the admission process.

331
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,080
Alright, that's it.

332
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,920
OK, OK.

333
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Thank you, doctor.

334
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,320
Thanks, doctor.

335
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,120
No problem.

336
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
So typically,

337
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,240
I just need to

338
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,720
pay and

339
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,200
pick up the meds, and that's it,

340
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,640
right?

341
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,680
Yes.

342
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,920
Thank you.

343
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,760
No problem.

344
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,840
You're alright?

345
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,120
I'm fine.

346
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,440
You should go back to school.

347
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,120
No way.

348
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,520
Just leave you here by yourself?

349
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,200
I've already had Xiao Xiaohua

350
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,000
request leave for me.

351
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,040
If I go back now,

352
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,040
wouldn't that be wasting the leave?

353
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,320
Zhang Li's family member,

354
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,680
come here, sign this.

355
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,840
You sign it.

356
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,120
It's the prescription pick-up slip, right?

357
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,040
I'll get the medicine.

358
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,080
Where's the pharmacy?

359
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,360
Hello, I need to pick up some medicine.

360
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,200
This is window number three, right?

361
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,680
It's not your turn yet, wait for yours.

362
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,800
Hello.

363
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
You're missing these two.

364
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,480
Go to the Chinese medicine section.

365
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,480
Hello, could you please tell me

366
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,480
where to pick up these two items?

367
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
Go straight

368
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,360
down the hall,

369
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,920
then make a left,

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
and you'll see a white door.

371
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,800
Inside is the place.

372
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,400
Got it, thank you.

373
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,080
Where is it, exactly?

374
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,800
Is this where I pick up this item?

375
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:13,880
Let me see.

376
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,080
Hold on.

377
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,160
Young man,

378
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,920
you're all over the place.

379
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,600
Haven't you picked up meds before?

380
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Who comes to the hospital every day?

381
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,080
Here, your medicine.

382
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,480
Thank you, doctor.

383
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,160
Your mother,

384
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,880
due to long-term overexertion

385
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,680
and not resting properly,

386
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,640
has suffered heart muscle damage.

387
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,600
If you had been any delayed,

388
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,040
it could have been life-threatening.

389
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,720
Hey,

390
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,720
why are you still here?

391
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,640
Ah.

392
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,080
You said you were going to stay the night.

393
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,560
I'll stay with you.

394
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,600
If you're tired,

395
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,480
you can take a break.

396
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
We can take turns.

397
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,280
It's cool.

398
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,360
I can manage on my own.

399
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,720
Come on,

400
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,480
have a seat.

401
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Here are the meds.

402
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,600
What about these?

403
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,440
How come I didn't see this one?

404
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,880
It must have been overlooked.

405
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,880
I'll get it now.

406
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,280
Hold on.

407
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,280
I'll go with you.

408
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,560
Let's go.

409
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,760
Are you sure?

410
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,720
I remember it being on the other side.

411
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,240
We're already here.

412
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Well done.

413
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
I looked everywhere

414
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,360
to find this place.

415
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,720
It's surprisingly close.

416
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,560
My mom's health

417
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,160
has always been fragile,

418
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,880
so besides home and school,

419
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,840
the hospital is the place

420
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,680
I frequent the most.

421
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,800
How's she?

422
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,600
You should rest a bit. I'll keep watch.

423
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,520
Lan Jinghui!

424
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,240
Apprentice,

425
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,760
what brings you here?

426
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,560
Ling Dong's mom fell sick.

427
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm here to pay her a visit.

428
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,840
My mom made this chicken soup with love,

429
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,160
especially for her.

430
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,240
Your mom doesn't think

431
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,960
you're dating us anymore, does she?

432
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,680
What are you talking about?

433
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,160
Our relationship, of course.

434
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,280
That's old news.

435
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,120
It's been put to rest a long time ago.

436
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,040
It ended that soon?

437
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,600
What, what, what

438
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,400
are you doing here?

439
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,720
Come on, let's go.

440
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,200
Here, Mom.

441
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,160
I feel a lot better now.

442
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,200
Do you?

443
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,040
I feel particularly lively today.

444
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,040
That's great.

445
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,400
This is the freshest batch.

446
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,440
Who's here?

447
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,560
- Hello, auntie. - Hello, auntie.

448
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,040
Your classmates have come.

449
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,440
This is the chicken soup my mom made.

450
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,520
Really good.

451
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
Thank you so much.

452
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,640
Thanks for coming

453
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,640
to visit me.

454
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,920
You've brought so much stuff.

455
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,240
You should focus on your studies.

456
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,480
No worries,

457
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,120
it's the weekend today.

458
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,720
Have you finished your homework?

459
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,360
All done, finished it a while ago.

460
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,160
Doctor.

461
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
- Doctor. - Doctor.

462
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,840
Doctor Zhang.

463
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,840
You guys go on.

464
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,680
I'll go wash some fruit.

465
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,960
You are recovering nicely.

466
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,040
We'll observe for a couple more days.

467
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,440
If there's no issue,

468
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,120
and once the report is out,

469
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,200
you can go home.

470
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,240
Thank you.

471
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,280
Doctor,

472
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,840
is it possible to leave a few days early?

473
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,600
My son's birthday is coming up,

474
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,520
and I'd like to be at home with him.

475
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,120
OK,

476
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
but remember,

477
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,160
you still need to recuperate at home.

478
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,640
OK.

479
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,480
Thank you, doctor.

480
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,880
Thank you, doctor.

481
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,640
Told you so, I could get discharged.

482
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,520
Auntie,

483
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,320
go ahead and

484
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,280
try this soup while it's warm.

485
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,080
Thank you.

486
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,640
Ling Dong, are you holding up OK?

487
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,040
Get plenty of rest these days.

488
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,640
I might as well

489
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,280
stay and keep you company.

490
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,080
It's fine.

491
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,520
I'm fine on my own.

492
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,160
You should head back soon.

493
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,360
Don't worry,

494
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,240
I'll keep you up to date with

495
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
homework and notes

496
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,640
while you're away from school.

497
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,680
He's going to be here

498
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,920
taking care of her mom.

499
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,120
He won't have time for notes and homework.

500
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,640
That's right.

501
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,880
Don't listen to him.

502
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,880
Just give them to me.

503
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,640
Then...

504
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,200
Alright then, go ahead.

505
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,000
I need to go upstairs.

506
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Alright, call us if you need anything.

507
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,080
Goodbye.

508
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,280
Xiaohua,

509
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,680
you've done so many paintings.

510
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,240
I had a late start compared to others,

511
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,720
so of course, I have to spend more time

512
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,400
practicing.

513
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
What's with the kettle here?

514
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,360
This is a relic from my grandma's time.

515
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,360
Where did you find this?

516
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,240
Just throw it away.

517
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,320
No, no, no!

518
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,120
This is my kettle of fortune.

519
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,280
An old-fashioned kettle like this.

520
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
This is quite obscure, isn't it?

521
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,200
In this day and age,

522
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,200
who still uses such a thing?

523
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,120
This is...

524
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,280
A kettle.

525
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,800
Will the exam include something like this?

526
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,800
It's all about predicting, right?

527
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,560
Just practice with everything you've got.

528
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,480
You can't overlook

529
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,280
any possibility.

530
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,080
Please be quiet now.

531
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
The exam duration is three hours.

532
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,480
Guys, please manage your time wisely.

533
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,680
Students,

534
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,200
our sketching topic this time

535
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,440
is "Rainy Day."

536
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,440
Depict the dynamics of three characters.

537
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
Jing University,

538
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,280
we're coming for you!

539
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,400
Jing University,

540
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,880
we're coming for you!

541
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,800
Jing University,

542
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,800
we're coming for you!

543
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,360
What?

544
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,880
He actually guessed the topic right?

545
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,880
He must have stumbled upon it by luck.

546
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,440
Even if it was luck,

547
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,480
he still got it right.

548
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,160
I'm actually thankful to him this time.

549
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,040
Who would have thought that Duncie

550
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,400
could be of use at a crucial moment?

551
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,000
Do you think he can

552
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,720
guess the final exams too?

553
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,760
Are you kidding?

554
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,200
For final exam predictions,

555
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,320
obviously, we turn to Ling Dong.

556
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,320
Ling Dong may be talented,

557
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,920
but Dingdang's knack for predictions

558
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,640
is also remarkable.

559
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,920
Dingdang?

560
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,600
Who's Dingdang?

561
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm not telling you!

562
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,200
What's with you,

563
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,400
always leaving things half-said?

564
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm not telling you!

565
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm not telling you.

566
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,080
I'm not telling you.

567
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,240
Come on, spill it!
