English subtitles are available

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,080
Bright Time EP26

3
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,560
Ma Yiming.

4
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,240
Isn't she Xu Mengyu

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,680
from your school?

6
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,880
Why is she here?

7
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,560
Be right back.

8
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
What? Where are you going?

9
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,760
Leaving us 2v3?

10
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,280
Mengyu.

11
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
You're here...?

12
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm stuck on my writing,

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
so I figured watching hoops

14
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,880
might spark some ideas.

15
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,560
Ma Yiming, come on back!

16
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
You're training pretty hard.

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,160
You bet.

18
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Our team's on fire.

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,360
Remember that last game we played...

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
Hey man, hurry!

21
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,800
Coming!

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,320
Mengyu, excuse me.

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,800
Nice shot! Alright.

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,840
Let's call it a day.

25
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,400
Hi, Ma Mao.

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,080
Mengyu, it's you.

27
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm done here.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,360
Wanna join me for dinner?

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:15,960
Let's go.

30
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,360
Okay.

31
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm off.

32
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,880
Bye.

33
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,680
Bye.

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,440
Good morning, Xiaohua.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,320
Yeah...

36
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
All done with homework

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
and notes.

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,080
So bored now.

39
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Xiaohua.

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,440
Got anything on your mind

41
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
that you need help with?

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
Whether it's life stuff

43
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
or schoolwork,

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,600
let's chat about it.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,920
Nope.

46
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Kinda weird

47
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
without my desk buddy around.

48
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,080
Looks like you miss me very much.

49
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Well, good thing,

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
I brought you some gifts.

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,920
Sure you'll love them.

52
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Why are you here?

53
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,280
Who's looking after your mom?

54
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
Someone is.

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Maybe you should take a few days off.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Now, check this one out.

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,360
What does the given info tell us?

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,680
We know EF is parallel to CD.

59
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,920
And EF...

60
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
Focus on EF.

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,320
Class's over.

62
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,080
Stand up.

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,200
Thank you, sir.

64
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
Are you coming with me to the hospital?

65
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Ling Dong's mom should be discharged today.

66
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,160
Whoops.

67
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
It slipped my mind.

68
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,800
Jinghui.

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,880
Do you remember

70
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,040
what day it is tomorrow?

71
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,640
Of course.

72
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
You really do?

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,640
It's Saturday,

74
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,240
a day of freedom

75
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
and lounging around till noon.

76
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,720
Been waiting five days,

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,400
how could I forget?

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,320
That's not what I'm talking about.

79
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,560
So it's a trivia question, huh?

80
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,040
World Oral Health Day?

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,320
Forget it, looks like you don't recall.

82
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,120
World Sleep Day?

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,760
Wrong.

84
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
Come on, spill the beans.

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,240
What's the answer?

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Really?

87
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah.

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm pretty sure.

89
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Alright, let's

90
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
do something special.

91
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,040
Mom, I'm back.

92
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Mom?

93
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Hello?

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,040
Surprise!

95
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,120
Happy birthday.

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,520
Happy birthday.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,200
♪Happy birthday to you♪

98
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,040
♪Happy birthday to you♪

99
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,520
♪Happy birthday to you♪

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,240
♪Happy birthday to you♪

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,640
We went

102
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,960
all out for this.

103
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,920
Surprised?

104
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,480
You guys did all this?

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,480
We did every single bit of it ourselves.

106
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,320
Dong.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,640
Wishing you

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,480
a wonderful 18th birthday!

109
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Thanks, mom.

110
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,640
Okay.

111
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,640
Candles, cake, wish!

112
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,240
Wish and cake.

113
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,520
Go.

114
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,800
Give me your bag.

115
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,440
Let's go.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
Earth gravity?

117
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
Nope, its

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
the Power of Friends.

119
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
Let's light the candles.

120
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
Yeah.

121
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,320
Okay.

122
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Alright, birthday star, make your wish.

123
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,840
They say that

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
18th birthday wishes

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,240
are extra lucky.

126
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,240
I bet you're wishing to

127
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,440
get into JU, right?

128
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,880
It's Ling Dong's big day.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,880
Let him make his own wish.

130
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
Don't mess around.

131
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,320
Hey! I'm not.

132
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
He totally wants that.

133
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Right, auntie?

134
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,880
Dong.

135
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,360
I think he's right.

136
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,920
Since you three are such good friends,

137
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,680
how about wishing you all

138
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,840
get into JU

139
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,000
next year?

140
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,320
Auntie, you're the best!

141
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
We're relying on you to

142
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,600
get us into JU.

143
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,680
Go on.

144
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
I hope I can always

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,880
be by my mom's side,

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,720
and that she stays healthy forever.

147
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
Happy birthday.

148
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,840
Xiaohua, how dare you, huh?

149
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,040
Careful.

150
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,960
Ms Fang.

151
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
Here's my college application form.

152
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,560
Why?

153
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,520
You're the top of your grade, and

154
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,120
you've won national physics comp.

155
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
With your grades, getting into

156
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,920
JU is in your pocket.

157
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Why don't you

158
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,120
aim for the top uni?

159
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
I've made up my mind.

160
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,840
It's alright.

161
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
You don't have to rush it.

162
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,560
And it's just

163
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,800
a practice round,

164
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,920
you can switch it up later.

165
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,400
Ling Dong.

166
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,720
You know,

167
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,720
JU is

168
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
a dream school for many.

169
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,760
You have the ability to get in,

170
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,280
so why would you

171
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,040
give it up?

172
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,960
And have you talked to your mom

173
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
about your decision?

174
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,080
Ling Dong, may I ask if there's

175
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,720
a connection between this

176
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
and your recent absences?

177
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
You know I can help

178
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,440
if you have any...

179
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,320
Ms Fang.

180
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,760
Rong University is my pick.

181
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
Alright, I won't push you.

182
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
you still have time

183
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,240
to think it through.

184
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,400
You're... aiming for RU?

185
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
You heard?

186
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,240
I didn't mean to.

187
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,120
It just happened.

188
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,200
I stumbled upon

189
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,320
Ms Fang and Mr Zhang

190
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,800
talking about how you

191
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,960
gave up JU because of

192
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,160
your mom.

193
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,120
But she's

194
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,000
out of the hospital already, right?

195
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,080
She's suffered from bad health,

196
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
so I gotta stick around

197
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
and take care of her.

198
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
What about your own dreams?

199
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
Your life and your aspirations?

200
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,880
As a kid,

201
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
I saw my dad

202
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560
get rushed to the ER,

203
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,240
but he didn't make it.

204
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,520
So when my mom

205
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,960
went through

206
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
the same thing,

207
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,640
I told myself,

208
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,040
I've lost my dad,

209
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,160
not my mom too.

210
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,560
Okay.

211
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,160
I got you back.

212
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,760
You mean it?

213
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,840
I mean it.

214
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,760
I really thought about it,

215
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,640
if it were me,

216
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,040
I'd do the same.

217
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,080
Don't sweat it, let's go.

218
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Keep up.

219
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,240
Mom.

220
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,800
Mom.

221
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,920
Dong, you're back.

222
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,360
I made you a bowl of noodles,

223
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,200
come and have a taste.

224
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,240
Mom.

225
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,800
The doctor said

226
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,920
you need to rest,

227
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,040
but you're in the kitchen already?

228
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,080
It's okay. Don't worry.

229
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,720
Come on, try this.

230
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,120
See how it tastes.

231
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,360
And some tasty treats.

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,520
Mom.

233
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,440
Is it good?

234
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,640
Very.

235
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,000
How time flies.

236
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Look at you, all grown up

237
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
and about to leave

238
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,480
for college.

239
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,400
Mom, I'm not leaving you.

240
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Your teacher called me,

241
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,880
saying you picked RU.

242
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,920
Dong.

243
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,120
It's a big deal.

244
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,200
You can't be so hasty.

245
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,680
I don't want you

246
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,480
rushing into this decision.

247
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,320
Dong, listen to me.

248
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,600
I know you're

249
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,440
worried about my health,

250
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,160
but your future

251
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,960
is more important.

252
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,720
Besides,

253
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,280
you've always wanna

254
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,400
get into JU for physics.

255
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,040
You're so good at your studies,

256
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
I know you can make it.

257
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,520
And

258
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,400
didn't you

259
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,760
and your friends

260
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
have a deal about JU?

261
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,480
Mom.

262
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,120
But right now

263
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
I don't wanna aim for JU anymore.

264
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,680
I just wanna be by your side.

265
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,120
That's what I truly want.

266
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,040
This could be

267
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
your big regret later on.

268
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,240
Listen.

269
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,920
It's a major life choice.

270
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
All I care about

271
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,080
in my life

272
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,920
is this family

273
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,080
and being with you.

274
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,680
My birthday wish was

275
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,480
always for your good health

276
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,040
and for me to

277
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,000
be by your side.

278
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,920
And you know me,

279
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,280
whether it's at RU or JU,

280
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,600
I'll do well.

281
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
What? Dong.

282
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
Why can't you

283
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,160
listen to me?

284
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,880
I don't wanna be

285
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,560
a burden to you,

286
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,920
okay?

287
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,800
Mom.

288
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,320
Even before you were in the hospital,

289
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,160
I'd already decided

290
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,840
on RU.

291
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,400
I wanna be by your side.

292
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,520
And

293
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,000
since it's just us two in the family,

294
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't wanna leave you alone.

295
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,040
But...

296
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,760
Mom.

297
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
This is my choice.

298
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,520
I got my own plans.

299
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,560
You want me to go to JU,

300
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,440
but that's not what I want.

301
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,080
It's what you think I want.

302
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,280
Being here with you,

303
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,160
taking care of you,

304
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,480
that's what matters most.

305
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,440
So, mom,

306
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,560
just for this once,

307
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,920
let me do it my way, okay?

308
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,880
I know you mean well.

309
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,240
But

310
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,640
it's like I'm holding you back.

311
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,240
This is huge,

312
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,560
why didn't you

313
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,640
talk to me about it?

314
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,240
Mom.

315
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,720
No egg today?

316
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,000
How about a fried one?

317
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,280
Then I'll go...

318
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,560
Stop distracting me.

319
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,200
Mom.

320
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,600
I've given this

321
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,280
a lot of thought,

322
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,080
it's not just a whim.

323
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,520
Don't you wanna see my happy face?

324
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,360
But...

325
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,840
Alright, mom.

326
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,600
I want a fried egg.

327
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,440
Alright.

328
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,520
Coming right up.

329
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,720
Thanks, mom.

330
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,480
Ready.

331
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,160
Smile wider.

332
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,200
One, two, three.

333
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
Cheese.

334
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,480
Wait.

335
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,080
One more.

336
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
3, 2, 1, go!

337
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,600
Cheese!

338
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
Perfect!

339
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
What are your summer plans?

340
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,760
No time for fun,

341
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,400
gotta hit the art studio

342
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,160
every day.

343
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
So miserable.

344
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,560
It hurts, but it's also fulfilling.

345
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,880
Good job.

346
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,120
I wasn't even in the shot!

347
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,800
What about you?

348
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,560
To take care of my mom.

349
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,680
And?

350
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Keep your studies on track.

351
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,520
Nah, thanks.

352
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,480
Ma Yiming.

353
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,200
What's up?

354
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
What's your plan?

355
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,400
I've got basketball training,

356
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,840
and I'm gonna play

357
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,480
in a match.

358
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,320
Cheer up.

359
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,480
I believe in you.

360
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,880
Don't let me down.

361
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,440
I won't.

362
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,320
Qingtian, the long vacation is coming up.

363
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,200
Why the sigh?

364
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,640
I don't like it at all.

365
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
I'm always alone at home.

366
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,880
It's so boring.

367
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,720
If you're bored,

368
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,440
I can hang out with you.

369
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,240
No way.

370
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,480
All you do

371
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,960
is make me study.

372
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,560
I don't wanna study during vacation.

373
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm stressed too.

374
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,800
During holidays,

375
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,600
all kinds of relatives come to visit

376
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,720
my house.

377
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,480
Those I know

378
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,920
and don't know,

379
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,680
some I can't even

380
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,600
know their names,

381
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,400
and

382
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,640
little kids...

383
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,960
They would just

384
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,440
make a mess,

385
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,640
and touch my stuff.

386
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,760
It's so annoying!

387
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,880
I'll never

388
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,040
have that problem.

389
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,160
Jinghui!

390
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,440
I'm coming!

391
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,320
Li'l Su, it's really you?

392
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
First, don't call me that.

393
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,280
My Chinese name is Su Xi,

394
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
and my English name is Susie.

395
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm...

396
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,400
grown up now,

397
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,840
so please don't

398
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
call me that anymore.

399
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,360
Second,

400
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm here for vacation at Grandma's house,

401
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
and to visit you by the way.

402
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
Susie?

403
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,960
Is it really you?

404
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,720
Who else?

405
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,600
Do you need to test me?

406
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Girls change a lot, right?

407
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,680
I almost

408
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,200
couldn't recognize you.

409
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,920
So this is just to be safe,

410
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,000
I have to test you.

411
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,920
Your game password is

412
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,720
2222.

413
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,360
And my...

414
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,240
Your bank card password

415
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,080
is also 2222.

416
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,440
I...

417
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,280
Your phone password

418
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,840
is 2222.

419
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,560
All your passwords

420
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,280
are 2222.

421
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,840
Only you would

422
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,360
use such silly passwords.

423
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,160
Li'l Su, it's really you.

424
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,520
Well, you can't blame me.

425
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,200
Don't you think

426
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,120
your outfit is too much?

427
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm telling you,

428
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
madam Chang Xiuying

429
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
is a quite traditional

430
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,200
Chinese OG.

431
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,200
But look at you,

432
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,240
you're too showy.

433
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
Remember to talk properly,

434
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,680
behave yourself,

435
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,760
and don't talk like rapping,

436
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,840
or you'll scare her.

437
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Are you listening?

438
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,240
C'mon, got it!

439
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,280
I'll get changed.

440
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,720
Grandma.

441
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
Li'l Su, you're back.

442
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,560
Grandma, I missed you so much!

443
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,480
Li'l Su,

444
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,280
well,

445
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,520
I missed you too.

446
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,360
Dad,

447
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
Grandma,

448
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,200
she is

449
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
not Li'l Su anymore,

450
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,960
you should call her Susie.

451
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,480
No,

452
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,280
I love

453
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
being called Li'l Su,

454
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,440
it's so endearing.

455
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Let me have a look at you.

456
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,480
You've grown taller and prettier.

457
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,840
Such a beautiful young lady now.

458
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,640
Li'l Su,

459
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
you've really changed a lot.

460
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,440
Yeah.

461
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,400
Why did you

462
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,400
suddenly come back?

463
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,080
You didn't even call.

464
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,800
I could have picked you up.

465
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,400
You've been away for long, huh?

466
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,720
Stay a few more days

467
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,360
and keep your Grandma company.

468
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,440
She's missed you.

469
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,200
If you need anything,

470
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,320
contact Jinghui.

471
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,200
Dad, no way.

472
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm so busy.

473
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
No worries.

474
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,640
I'll definitely keep in touch with him,

475
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
whether he's willing or not.

476
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,800
Okay.

477
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,320
If he bullies you,

478
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,080
tell me,

479
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,200
and I'll deal with him.

480
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,480
Dad, do you think that's possible?

481
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,040
Let's go.

482
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,440
Li'l Su,

483
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
I'll show you to your room.

484
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,280
Jinghui, thank you for helping me carry

485
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,200
my luggage upstairs.

486
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,240
When did I agree

487
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,360
to do that?

488
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,080
Grandma, it's too heavy for me.

489
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,800
Jinghui,

490
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,560
just help your sister.

491
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,840
She's a delicate girl.

492
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,960
As a boy,

493
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,120
you should take care of her.

494
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,120
Yeah, exactly.

495
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,760
Let's go.

496
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,080
Li'l Su,

497
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,840
what's

498
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,440
in your suitcase?

499
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
Weights? It's so heavy.

500
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,520
Be careful.

501
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,720
Those are my treasures.

502
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,760
Jesus. You eat

503
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
3 bowls of rice every meal,

504
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,560
how heavy can it be?

505
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,960
It's not that heavy.

506
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,200
Carry it up.

507
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,040
Dad. Dad!

508
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,480
Why did you just toss it?

509
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,080
I didn't toss it.

510
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,000
I put it on the bed.

511
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,560
My Estée Lauder,

512
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,920
so cute.

513
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
My SK-II,

514
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,120
and my Chanel.

515
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,440
What are these?

516
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,640
You know nothing

517
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,280
These are worth

518
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,400
more than your game consoles.

519
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
My babies,

520
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,840
you're finally home now

521
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,920
after a long journey.

522
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,480
Alright, alright.

523
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,280
Stop wiping.

524
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,400
It's already clean.

525
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,160
What's there to wipe?

526
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,520
Hurry

527
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,280
and clean up.

528
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,000
We're going out.

529
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,160
Where to?

530
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,520
Madam Chang Xiuying

531
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,440
gave me a task

532
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,640
to take you out for shopping

533
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,320
and having fun.

534
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,880
I'm not going.

535
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,920
I'm jet-lagged.

536
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,840
Go by yourself.

537
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,840
You flew from Singapore.

538
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,360
Do you need to deal with jet lag?

539
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
I don't want to go.

540
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,240
I want to watch shows.

541
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,640
You said it.

542
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,920
I'm going out with friends.

543
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,720
Don't go snitching

544
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,640
to her.

545
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,200
I won't.

546
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,040
Explain it yourself.

547
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,800
Go ahead.

548
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,440
Don't worry about me.

549
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,120
Really?

550
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,280
Bye.

551
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,600
Hello?

552
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,720
Everything goes well.

553
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,320
Don't worry.

554
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,640
Just leave it to me.

555
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,880
I've got it all planned.

556
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
I'll go to his room later

557
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,840
and take care of it.

558
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,080
Okay.

559
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,400
Jinghui?

560
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,000
Jinghui?

561
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,560
Why...

562
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,560
Why are you here?

563
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,040
Why am I here?

564
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
This is my room.

565
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,520
You tell me.

566
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,840
Where else would I be?

567
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
Aren't you going out

568
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,880
with friends?

569
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,120
I am, right now.

570
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,840
Aren't you going to watch shows?

571
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,200
Why are you here?

572
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,640
Yeah,

573
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,760
watching shows.

574
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,040
I...

575
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,400
just...

576
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,720
don't know the Wi-Fi password.

577
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,840
What's the Wi-Fi password?

578
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
I'll text it to you.

579
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,480
Why aren't you leaving?

580
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm leaving.

581
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,080
I'm telling you,

582
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,960
don't bother me while I'm studying.

583
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,000
Are you studying?

584
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
You're playing games.

585
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,400
Can't I study while gaming?

586
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,400
I can learn in games.

587
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,320
I'll teach you.

588
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,840
I'll help you level up.

589
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,400
Really?

590
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,200
Really?

591
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,920
Really?

592
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,600
No, thanks.

593
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
I can really teach you.

594
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,640
Thank you.

595
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,560
Your mom's recovery is going well.

596
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,520
Doctor,

597
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,760
what should we

598
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,720
watch out for when we go back?

599
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,520
Overall,

600
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,760
she's doing fine.

601
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,920
Just remember

602
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
to rest more and

603
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,080
don't be tired.

604
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,280
If there's

605
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,360
any discomfort with the heart,

606
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,880
come for another check-up.

607
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,200
See, I told you.

608
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm fine.

609
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,440
No need for a follow-up.

610
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,720
Mom,

611
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
health isn't something to be careless about.

612
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,120
Your son is right.

613
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,800
Better safe than sorry.

614
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes.

615
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,400
Okay.

616
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,400
Doctor, we're leaving.

617
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:30,960
Thank you.

618
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,720
You're welcome.

619
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,440
Thanks, Doctor.

620
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,320
Goodbye.

621
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Bye.

622
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,200
See, nothing to worry about.

623
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,080
You're just

624
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,880
too tense.

625
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,600
Mom, just take care.

626
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,920
I will, don't worry.

627
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,320
Let's go home and have dinner.

628
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,400
Jinghui,

629
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560
I think your room

630
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,520
is great.

631
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,240
Look at the layout, the decor,

632
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,040
and the lighting,

633
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,080
I like it.

634
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,960
Your room isn't different

635
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,320
from mine.

636
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,840
This guy is handsome.

637
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,200
I know.

638
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,240
Make it clear,

639
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,480
him or me?

640
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,120
In the photo,

641
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,160
am I not more handsome?

642
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,480
Yeah, you're the most handsome.

643
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,040
Your bed...

644
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,240
is so hard.

645
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,120
I like sleeping on hard beds.

646
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,400
Stop talking nonsense.

647
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,040
Your bed is the same

648
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,160
as mine.

649
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,760
Your room

650
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,240
is really nice.

651
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,480
What do you want?

652
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,200
Can I...

653
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,400
Can I switch rooms

654
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,440
with you, Jinghui?

655
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,920
Wait and see,

656
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,120
I will handle this.

657
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,680
Be careful.

658
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,520
Finally home.

659
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,440
Mom, want an orange?

660
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,920
I'll peel it for you.

661
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,120
Sit down.

662
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,600
Okay.

663
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,920
Dong,

664
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,000
what's your birthday wish?

665
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,160
Mom,

666
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,920
didn't I tell you before?

667
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,560
I know,

668
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,640
I just want you

669
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,160
to say it again.

670
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
My wish is for you

671
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
to always be healthy,

672
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
so I can always be with you.

673
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,280
See,

674
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,800
your wish has

675
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,560
come true.

676
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
You just heard it.

677
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,960
The doctor said I'm fine.

678
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,840
Everything's good.

679
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,960
I want to discuss something with you.

680
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,320
Mom,

681
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,040
don't bother.

682
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,760
We've

683
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,040
talked about the college.

684
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,440
Well,

685
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,280
I know you're being filial.

686
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,800
You can choose to stay.

687
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,280
It's your choice.

688
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,520
I respect that.

689
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,520
But I just wanna

690
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,680
discuss with you

691
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,840
whether I can go to

692
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,920
JU with you.

693
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,560
I wanna see you there

694
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,720
and achieve success.

695
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,400
It will make me happier.

696
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,560
I don't want to regret it.

697
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,200
I'll always

698
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
be by your side.

699
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,280
A house is not a home.

700
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,360
Home is where you are.

701
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,400
What do you say?

702
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,400
Mom...

703
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,680
Happy birthday!

704
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,280
Ling Dong, happy birthday.

705
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,200
This is for you.

706
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,560
Your wish at eighteen

707
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,160
will come true.

708
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,280
Ling Dong,

709
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,680
may all your wishes come true,

710
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,280
and may your path be smooth.
