Bright Time EP23

3
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Xiao Datu.

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,040
What are you doing?

5
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
Sneaking around with something?

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,800
What?

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,440
N... nothing.

8
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,640
Wow,

9
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,560
so expensive.

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
Bought another art book?

11
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,360
Can't you buy something useful?

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,360
Like groceries, maybe?

13
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,680
What are you up to?

14
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,920
Honey, this...

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
this art book

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
has great collection value.

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,720
Value?

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,160
Do you really think you're an artist

19
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,040
or a collector?

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,480
Let me tell you, Xiao Datu,

21
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,680
when we got married,

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,200
you said

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,240
you had a talent for painting,

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,920
and I believed you.

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,400
What have you

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,840
accomplished over the years?

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
I do have talent.

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
What talent?

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,200
I have exceptional talent.

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Mom, I'm back.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,280
Xiaohua!

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,120
Xiaohua, you're back.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,640
Sweetie, happy?

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,320
Yes, happy.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,480
Great, great.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,160
Take a rest.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,920
You must be tired, right?

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Go ahead.

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,320
Have some rest.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Good job, Xiaohua.

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
Put your change outside.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Okay.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,840
I'll wash them later.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,080
Xiao Datu,

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,160
listen to me!

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,240
I have

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
good news for everyone.

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,360
In the national physics competition,

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,720
our class's Ling Dong

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,760
and Chen Luyang

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,360
won first

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
and second place, respectively.

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,440
Let's congratulate them.

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,520
All right,

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,040
I hope all students

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,480
will take them as examples

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,920
and strive to be like them.

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,760
Additionally,

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,680
I have another announcement.

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,600
Our school has set up

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
an art course.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,200
Interested students

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
can come to me after class

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
for the application form,

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,600
get it signed by your parents at home.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
This course

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,200
is voluntary.

68
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,720
A reminder:

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,160
art exams are not an easy way out.

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
So,

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,920
think carefully,

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,000
discuss with your parents

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,640
before applying.

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
Okay, class begin.

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,040
Stand up.

76
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,120
Hello, teacher.

77
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,440
How's Ms. Guo feeling today?

78
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,760
Partly cloudy, turning sunny.

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,480
Quite bright.

80
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,360
What's up?

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Mom, can I help you with the veggies?

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,640
What is it this time?

83
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,640
No, not at all.

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,280
Then what is it?

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
I...

86
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,960
I want to...

87
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,080
What is it?

88
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
I want to learn painting.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,800
Never mind.

90
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,840
I'll go do my homework.

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Go ahead.

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,600
Doudou,

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,760
what if my mom

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
says no to painting?

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,520
I'm so scared she'll reject me.

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,560
Life's paintbrush

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,960
is in your own hands.

98
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
How will you know if you don't try?

99
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,000
The senior is right.

100
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,800
Life's paintbrush

101
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
is in your own hands.

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
How will you know if you don't try?

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,640
Mom!

104
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,280
What?

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,520
I want to apply for the art exam.

106
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,920
No way.

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,120
Mom, my dear mom,

108
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,520
didn't you want me

109
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,400
to learn painting before?

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
That was

111
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,320
to cultivate an interest,

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,440
not make it a career,

113
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,400
much less be a painter.

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
What's wrong with being a painter?

115
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,600
Dad's a painter,

116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,400
and our family is fine.

117
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Right, Dad?

118
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,080
Actually, I think...

119
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,160
Xiao Datu!

120
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
When I'm talking to our daughter,

121
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
don't interrupt.

122
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,080
You continue.

123
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,400
Sweetie,

124
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,640
one artist in the family,

125
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
your dad, is enough.

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
You don't need to get involved.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,080
You are a student.

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,960
Your job now is to

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,320
focus on the college entrance exam,

130
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,640
study, and study more.

131
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,000
Go back to your room and study.

132
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,320
But the college entrance exam

133
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,840
isn't the only way.

134
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,720
People need dreams.

135
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
Without dreams, what's the

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
difference from being a salted fish?

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
Painting is my dream.

138
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,840
I've never

139
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,000
felt this strongly.

140
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
My dear mom,

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,160
please let me.

142
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,160
Xiaohua,

143
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,760
be rational.

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,960
Look at you,

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,440
talking non-stop.

146
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
Do you know what time it is?

147
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,680
And you're still talking about dreams.

148
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
What about dreams?

149
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,840
Can they feed you?

150
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,960
You're a student.

151
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Your job is to

152
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
study, study, and study more.

153
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,600
The college entrance exam

154
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,400
is your way out.

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
Why don't you understand?

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,440
Go, study!

157
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
If you didn't

158
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,280
want me to paint,

159
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
why did you

160
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
name me Xiaohua?

161
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
I know you're upset.

162
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
You know

163
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,520
your mom's temper.

164
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,320
Handle her gently.

165
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,320
Don't confront her.

166
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,600
I didn't speak up

167
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,600
to avoid making things worse.

168
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,880
Is this the application form?

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
Needs a signature, right?

170
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,280
There are two parents here.

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,240
Besides your mom,

172
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm here too.

173
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,360
Xiaohua,

174
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,800
how did you

175
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,640
talk to your mom?

176
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
Apologize

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,000
properly.

178
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,960
Mom,

179
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
I didn't mean

181
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,000
to speak like that.

182
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,160
What...

183
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,400
What's there to apologize for?

184
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,800
No overnight grudges.

185
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,360
All right, all right,

186
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
let's eat.

187
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,720
I'll make a few dishes.

188
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,560
Tomato stir-fry for dinner?

189
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,760
So fancy.

190
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,840
Fine,

191
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
it's not enough.

192
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll go to the market and buy more food.

193
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,000
We'll have a proper meal tonight.

194
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,280
Well,

195
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,240
you all rest for a bit.

196
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,040
Thank you.

197
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,440
Action.

198
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,880
Dad,

199
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,880
you've hidden so much pocket money.

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm going to tell Mom.

201
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,400
Painting materials

202
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,040
cost money.

203
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,760
This is all I've got.

204
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,440
Shh.

205
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,240
Okay.

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
Here are the study materials.

207
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
Only you two are going for the

208
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,120
art entrance exam,

209
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
so make sure

210
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,160
to help

211
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,920
each other out

212
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,600
if you have any problems.

213
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,280
And,

214
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,360
from this week,

215
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
classes are

216
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,120
Monday to Friday

217
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,360
after school

218
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
and all day Saturday.

219
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
If you're going to do it,

220
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,520
be punctual

221
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,400
and dedicated.

222
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,920
Don't worry, Ms. Fang.

223
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,080
I will

224
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,320
give it my all.

225
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,120
I'll work hard too.

226
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Also,

227
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,400
in about a month,

228
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,120
you'll have

229
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
the proficiency test.

230
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
I believe

231
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,280
you'll

232
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,080
do great.

233
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,520
Thanks, Ms. Fang.

234
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Good luck.

235
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,400
Mengyu,

236
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,880
what's usually on

237
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,160
the proficiency test?

238
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
You really have no clue, huh?

239
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,920
I really

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
have no idea.

241
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,840
I just signed up out of passion.

242
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
The proficiency test is the first step

243
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,080
in our province's art exam.

244
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Passing it

245
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,520
is prerequisite for the provincial

246
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,480
and school exams.

247
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,480
Is it tough?

248
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
It's not easy.

249
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,840
And

250
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,360
for those without a foundation,

251
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,920
it can be challenging.

252
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,600
Am I in trouble then?

253
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,800
This is just the start.

254
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,760
School exam and college entrance exam

255
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
are the real challenges.

256
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,640
Aren't you passionate?

257
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Don't get discouraged now.

258
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,680
I'll do my best.

259
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,520
You too.

260
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,080
Of course.

261
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,880
I'm going to find Ms. Yu.

262
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,760
You go ahead.

263
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay, bye.

264
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,160
Bye.

265
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,600
Congrats, apprentice.

266
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,400
Now you can

267
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,200
focus on learning art.

268
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,680
This set of paints and art supplies

269
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,560
was chosen by Ling Dong

270
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,560
and me.

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,760
I also prepared

272
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,000
this for you.

273
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Friends,

274
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm determined to

275
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,760
get into Jing University!

276
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,560
Honey,

277
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,920
I've been standing for quite a while.

278
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,840
Can I take a break?

279
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,560
No!

280
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,720
Stand straight!

281
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,560
Stomach in!

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
Head up!

283
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,360
Xiao Datu,

284
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
why did you

285
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
hide money from me

286
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,720
all these years?

287
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,800
What examples are you setting

288
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
for our child?

289
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,840
Mom,

290
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,120
isn't this...

291
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,320
understandable?

292
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,320
Right?

293
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,560
Understandable?

294
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:14,840
Sweetie,

295
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
in our warm,

296
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
pure home?

297
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,920
How can there be deceit?

298
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,120
You know,

299
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,080
mommy loves everyone so much.

300
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,960
By the way,

301
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,080
I've signed you up

302
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,960
for a tutoring class.

303
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
It starts this week.

304
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Of course,

305
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,200
thanks to your dad's

306
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,520
hidden money,

307
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,560
we could pay the tuition.

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Xiaohua,

309
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,520
thank your dad for his efforts.

310
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,480
Thanks, Dad.

311
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,280
Study hard.

312
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,600
Okay.

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,040
Stand straight!

314
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,200
Stomach in!

315
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,640
The art class

316
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,520
overlaps with

317
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
the master tutoring class.

318
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,480
What now?

319
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,440
I have an idea.

320
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Split yourself in two.

321
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,160
Paint

322
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,280
and fool your mom.

323
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,960
Great idea.

324
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,280
Show me how to split first.

325
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,000
I was joking.

326
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,840
Have some humor sense.

327
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,880
Xiaohua,

328
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,080
is your tutoring class

329
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
on campus or off-campus?

330
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
Off-campus.

331
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,320
Mom gave me

332
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
a student card

333
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
to use.

334
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,080
That's easier.

335
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,200
Just get someone

336
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,240
to go for you.

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,680
Yeah,

338
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
no one

339
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,760
knows you off-campus.

340
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,200
Have someone

341
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,840
stand in for you.

342
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,520
Impressive.

343
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,680
Flawless.

344
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
Indeed.

345
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,640
Really?

346
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
Say something.

347
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,640
I'm Xiao Xiaohua.

348
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,840
Well...

349
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
The voice is rough,

350
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
but passable.

351
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Stand up and let's see.

352
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,280
Too tall.

353
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,000
Qingtian,

354
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,880
looks like it's up to you.

355
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,880
She?

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,880
Why didn't you say so earlier?

357
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,160
Are you setting me up?

358
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,760
Hmm,

359
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,360
I thought that was obvious.

360
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Feel the

361
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,320
pen's weight

362
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,160
when drawing.

363
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Don't make heavy strokes.

364
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,040
Xiao Xiaohua did well.

365
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,040
Everyone, you can

366
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,000
check her sketch

367
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,720
after class.

368
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,640
Morning, daughter.

369
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,560
Morning, Dad.

370
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,080
Hmm?

371
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,560
Breakfast is simple today?

372
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,800
What?

373
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,280
I'll tell Mom.

374
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,480
Shh,

375
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,040
breakfast is fancy.

376
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,760
Hmm.

377
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,360
Where's your mom?

378
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,520
She went to buy groceries.

379
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,480
Oh.

380
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,080
I'm done. I'm leaving.

381
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:14,960
Wait.

382
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,520
Where are you going?

383
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,760
To the tutoring class.

384
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,120
Right, tutoring.

385
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,280
Eat more, keep your strength up.

386
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
I'm on a diet.

387
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,240
Bye.

388
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Why diet at your age?

389
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,800
Bye-bye.

390
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,080
Bye-bye.

391
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Study well.

392
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,960
Xiaohua.

393
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,360
What?

394
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,960
Ling Dong,

395
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,680
what brings you here?

396
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,800
Xia Qingtian has something at home.

397
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,080
I'll be delivering your art supplies.

398
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,280
That's kind of you.

399
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
It's no trouble, really. It's on my way.

400
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,040
Let me carry the supplies.

401
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,840
No need, I've got it.

402
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,480
Let's go.

403
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,200
Thanks.

404
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,480
The photo's blurry,

405
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,960
can't see the face well.

406
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
But he seems pretty handsome,

407
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,480
reminds me of my younger days.

408
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,120
Can you be serious?

409
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,760
Hmm?

410
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Where are you going?

411
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,720
Going to check Xiaohua's room for clues.

412
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,560
Oh.

413
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,320
Wait,

414
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,040
I'm coming too.

415
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,840
Hey,

416
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,360
honey,

417
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,280
this is...

418
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
this is our daughter's room.

419
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,320
Come on,

420
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,480
we shouldn't rummage through it.

421
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,560
It's not proper.

422
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm just checking.

423
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,840
No-nothing special.

424
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,560
Nothing.

425
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,560
Nothing.

426
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,200
See?

427
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,200
What are you doing?

428
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,440
No.

429
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,360
It's...

430
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,040
It's not good!

431
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,720
Honey, honey.

432
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,360
Honey.

433
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,720
Honey. Hon...

434
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,480
Xiao Datu!

435
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,920
Look what it is!

436
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,760
Wow!

437
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,680
Is it a sketch of our daughter?

438
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Brilliant!

439
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,480
Look at those facial lines.

440
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
So clean, so smooth.

441
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,720
She inherited my good qualities.

442
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I mean,

443
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,240
it's nice for her to draw in spare time.

444
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,360
It helps to relieve stress.

445
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,520
Drawing?

446
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,200
Am I talking about drawing?

447
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,400
This girl is in love!

448
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,480
What?

449
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,360
Look, look!

450
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:36,920
Oh.

451
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,000
Oops.

452
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,920
Which one of these two brats

453
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,760
is our daughter's

454
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,440
crush?

455
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,000
Whoever isn't okay!

456
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,760
It's almost time for

457
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,720
the college entrance exam, and she

458
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,880
is obsessed with all this nonsense.

459
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,880
How would she be able to

460
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,880
concentrate on her study?

461
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
Well, honey.

462
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
All of the teenagers

463
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,640
have issues during this period.

464
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,760
Weren't we like this

465
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,920
when we were young?

466
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,280
Do you want me to talk to her?

467
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,720
No.

468
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,840
We can't alarm her.

469
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,320
We should plan it carefully.

470
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,440
Mom, I'm going out.

471
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,360
Are you going to the tutoring class?

472
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,840
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm off.

474
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay.

475
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Ling Dong.

476
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,480
Hello.

477
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,040
You've been waiting long?

478
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,840
I should have

479
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,840
come here earlier.

480
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,000
It's alright. I just got here.

481
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,280
Let's go.

482
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,120
Let me take this.

483
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,520
It's okay. It's not heavy.

484
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,560
Come on. Get on.

485
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,160
Be careful.

486
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
Mom. Dad.

487
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,240
You both are here.

488
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,400
You're in a good mood, huh?

489
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,880
How's your tutoring?

490
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,360
It's good.

491
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,640
The teacher's lecture was lively.

492
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,720
I think

493
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,440
it might work well.

494
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,840
Are there any other bo...,

495
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,960
classmate of yours?

496
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,880
Other classmates?

497
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,600
No.

498
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,800
Don't you have a study partner

499
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,960
with one of

500
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,320
your classmates?

501
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,560
He didn't go to tutoring with you?

502
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,200
I've improved my grades,

503
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,480
so Ms. Fang said there's

504
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,040
no need to continue.

505
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,880
That classmate of yours,

506
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,880
what's his name again?

507
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,680
Ling Dong.

508
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,800
Ling Dong.

509
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,000
Did you go to his place

510
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,280
for tutoring over the winter break?

511
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,480
No.

512
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,440
It was Lan Jinghui's place.

513
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
A boy is teaching you,

514
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,400
and another boy let you

515
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,320
study in his place.

516
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,600
Which one is the one?

517
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,760
The one?

518
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,160
It's not... I'm thinking...

519
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
That Ling Dong,

520
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,000
and

521
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,280
Lan Jinghui.

522
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,960
Yeah.

523
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
I want to invite them over

524
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,640
for dinner.

525
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,160
I'll prepare a feast.

526
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,920
What?

527
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,400
What's wrong?

528
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,360
I don't understand.

529
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,120
Why do you want

530
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,280
to invite them for dinner?

531
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,320
It's not hard to understand.

532
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,920
It's so nice of them

533
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,200
to help you with the study.

534
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,920
I should thank them.

535
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,160
Yes.

536
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,360
They severed you at the last New Year eve.

537
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,800
They treated you so well.

538
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,640
That's why

539
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
we should express appreciation.

540
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
It is a deal!

541
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,520
You can go now.

542
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,200
Yeah!

543
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,080
You've been

544
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,440
looking at us

545
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,480
with hesitation

546
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,640
since a while ago.

547
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,360
Spit it out.

548
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
What do you want?

549
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,840
I have a teeny-weeny,

550
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,480
itsy-bitsy wish.

551
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,320
I can grand it as long as

552
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,160
it's legal and reasonable.

553
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,360
This wish

554
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,240
is definitely legal and reasonable.

555
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,160
And it can fill your bellies.

556
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,760
It's a good deal.

557
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,880
That is to

558
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,400
come over for dinner this Friday.

559
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,800
Let's go through the battle plan

560
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,960
for this evening.

561
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,160
We'll use cuisine

562
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
to break down their defenses.

563
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,920
Use words to unravel the truth.

564
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,080
We'll find out

565
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,080
who our daughter's crush is

566
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,560
and SLASH! Work done.

567
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,120
No more puppy love.

568
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,040
Perfect.

569
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah.

570
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,760
First of all,

571
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,880
we need to find out

572
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,000
who knows her likes and dislikes.

573
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,480
Then,

574
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,160
we'll find who serves her.

575
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
Don't worry.

576
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,520
What's that famous detective's name?

577
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,560
Formalin.

578
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,840
Then I can be "Xiaormalin".

579
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,200
No.

580
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,760
It's Holmes.

581
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,440
Get more education.

582
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,080
Xiao Datu, Xiao Datu.

583
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,960
Draw less, read more books.

584
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,880
OK?

585
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,840
Gosh.

586
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,720
Do your work!

587
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,120
I've been thinking,

588
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,080
what happened to your hand, mister?

589
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,560
My wrist's sprained.

590
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Right.

591
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,080
Thank you again

592
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,920
for inviting us for dinner

593
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,600
at your home.

594
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,960
Shall we start?

595
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,120
Thank you so much.

596
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,880
Help yourselves!

597
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,440
Okay, okay.

598
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
Here, try this snow pea.

599
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
It looks so delicious.

600
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
It's good for intestinal activity

601
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,160
and your skin.

602
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:33,880
Here.

603
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Try this.

604
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
The pork chop

605
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,240
looks so delicious.

606
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,200
Try more meat.

607
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,240
Meat is always the main dish!

608
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,160
What's going on?

609
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,120
Why neither of them

610
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,520
serve our daughter?

611
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,720
They must be pretending.

612
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,040
Just wait for it.

613
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
Lan Jinghui.

614
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,880
Try this streaky bacon.

615
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,920
Let me serve you.

616
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,840
Thanks.

617
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,320
Ling Dong, try this.

618
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,640
Thank you.

619
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,840
Does this mean

620
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,840
she's into both of them?

621
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
I hope today's dinner

622
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,320
is to your liking.

623
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Here, try this.

624
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,200
Wait!

625
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,920
Hold on, mom.

626
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,320
Ling Dong dislikes cilantro or chili.

627
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,880
I told you.

628
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,920
This boy is the one.

629
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,800
But Lan Jinghui likes them.

630
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,520
Yes.

631
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,080
Cilantro and chili

632
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,520
are the souls of a meal.

633
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
This one may be the one, too.

634
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,360
No worries.

635
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,440
There's been a glitch

636
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,800
in electricity for a while.

637
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
Xiaohua,

638
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,640
Jinghui's families must have paid extra efforts

639
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,720
to take care of you

640
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,040
during the winter break.

641
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,120
No.

642
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
It's okay, ma'am.

643
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,080
My grandma likes her so much

644
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,240
that she wishes she'd come every day.

645
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,560
Pay more attention to this one.

646
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,200
Well,

647
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
you must live far from school.

648
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,680
Yeah, kind of.

649
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,800
Do you usually take the bus

650
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,000
or the subway

651
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
to school?

652
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,360
I mostly

653
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,880
go by bike.

654
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,600
It's fast.

655
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,840
No way.

656
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,120
Ling Dong, you must be taking the bus

657
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,920
to school, right?

658
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,840
No, ma'am.

659
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,400
I take the bike, too.

660
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,960
Mom!

661
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,640
What are you doing?

662
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
You ask too much.

663
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,120
They'll mistake you as policewoman.

664
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,000
Let them have their meal.

665
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,440
Go back to dinner.

666
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,880
Dad, bon appétit.

667
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,920
Go back to dinner!

668
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,760
Okay, go back to dinner.

669
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,000
Dinner, dinner.

670
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,840
Right, right.

671
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,080
Help yourselves.

672
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,440
Don't rush.

673
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,600
I'm full. I don't want to

674
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,120
get gastroptosis.

675
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,040
You're so weak.

676
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,720
Is it just me, or your mom

677
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,080
was trying to get something from us?

678
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,560
I'm sure about it.

679
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,440
I knew it!

680
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
You feel something suspicious, too.

681
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,960
Is there something wrong

682
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
with my mom?

683
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,960
But

684
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,320
what for?

685
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,680
There must be something wrong.

686
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,400
She's been strange

687
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,280
since the day I came back

688
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,320
from tutoring.

689
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Does that mean

690
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,320
she's found out that you are

691
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,200
learning to draw?

692
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,200
If she knew,

693
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,320
why hadn't she just asked you?

694
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,760
She's probably just getting suspicious.

695
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,400
Why don't you ask your dad

696
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,520
if he knows one thing

697
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,400
or two.

698
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,800
If he really knew something,

699
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,320
he would've told me.

700
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,920
He and I are on the same side.

701
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,240
Then

702
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
there's only one way left.

703
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
What is it?

704
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
Put your mom's concerns to rest.

705
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
Easy to say.

706
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
How to do it?

707
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,440
Come.

708
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,360
I'll tell you.

709
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,440
How do you think

710
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,920
who the bus boy is?

711
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't think either of them are.

712
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Put your hand down.

713
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,200
You really think you're Formalin?

714
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Holmes.

715
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,680
They both seemed normal.

716
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,560
There's nothing odd about them.

717
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,080
Honey,

718
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,480
how do you think

719
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
both of them?

720
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
I think they're good boys.

721
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,240
I think,

722
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,800
that Lan Jinghui is good.

723
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,400
He's nice. He's a sweet talker.

724
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,960
But I think Ling Dong is better.

725
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,160
The boy

726
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,040
is steady and calm.

727
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,120
He can do great things in the future.

728
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,760
He's too calm

729
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,040
for a kid.

730
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,600
They're not that young.

731
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,600
If he can't remain calm now,

732
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,640
how will he be in the future?

733
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,360
Nonsense.

734
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,320
They're teenagers.

735
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,280
They're bound to be lively.

736
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,960
Nonsense.

737
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
One's fate can be seen from childhood.

738
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
If one can't remain calm from a young age,

739
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,120
they won't be successful in the future.

740
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Just like you.

741
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,680
You see,

742
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,400
What's about me?

743
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,120
You keep fidgeting,

744
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,720
unlike a grown-up.

745
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,160
What's it got to do with me?

746
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,040
It's none of my...

747
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,400
You never take my advice!

748
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,120
I tell you!

749
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,800
I tell you!

750
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,560
Xiao Datu!

751
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,520
Honey.

752
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,320
What's wrong?

753
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,440
Go wash dishes.

754
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,720
Go have your shower.

755
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,800
You're so clever.

756
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,120
Cleverer than ever.

757
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,480
Then I'll go home now. Bye!

758
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,000
Bye. Bye.

759
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,680
Bye.

760
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,320
Bye.

761
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,760
Safe travels.

762
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,440
Okay.

763
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,440
Which one of us do you think

764
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,720
her parents like better?

765
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,120
Isn't it obvious?

766
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,640
Sure.

767
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,480
It's me, of course!

768
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,280
You're so cocky!

769
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,840
I would say it's me!

770
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,720
Didn't you notice

771
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,520
how her mom looked at me?

772
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,760
Then didn't you notice

773
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,480
how happy her dad was

774
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,360
when he looked at me,

775
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,480
and how unhappy when he looked at you?

776
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,920
No way!

777
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,880
Did you notice

778
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,600
she didn't let me do the dishes

779
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,520
after dinner because

780
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,240
she didn't want me to get tired.

781
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,760
I even got an orange from him.

782
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,840
Did you get one?

783
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,120
She,

784
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,160
she even called me by my nickname.

785
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,800
So intimate.

786
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,720
Yeah, you win the game.

787
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
"Li'l Hui".

788
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,840
Don't lump things together.

789
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,520
It's got nothing to do

790
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,000
with the name itself.

791
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,680
What I mean

792
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,520
by giving you this example

793
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,160
is that

794
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,640
I'm an easy-going person,

795
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,360
and she got along better with me.

796
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
But you can't call me that.

797
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,080
They're,

798
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
they're two different things,

799
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,000
you know?

800
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,120
It's not that easy to get into Hengyuan.

801
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,160
It's normal to be out.

802
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,640
A tryout means

803
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,320
to give it a try.

804
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,520
You've tried and it showed

805
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,400
you're better than me.

806
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,480
What's so great to be better than you?

807
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,440
I was just careless that day.

808
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,640
I didn't lose that game.

809
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,160
We'll see next year.

810
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,280
Silly.

811
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
There're no more games for the 12th grade.

812
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,600
Yeah, I forgot.

813
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,240
By the way,

814
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
I heard you didn't show up for practice

815
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,440
when I tried out.

816
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,000
Right.

817
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,080
I didn't play anymore.

818
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,680
I've tried.

819
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,080
I lost it.

820
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,920
I can give you another chance.

821
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,840
We can fight a duel.

822
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,880
No regrets.

823
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,000
Have you thought about the future?

824
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,840
I mean,

825
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,760
after high school?

826
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,400
No.

827
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,520
I probably keep playing basketball.

828
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,520
I'm off.

829
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,880
What's your plan for the future?

830
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,160
I want to go to university.

831
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,000
Jing University.

832
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,600
Actually,

833
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,080
you guys were pretty good that day.

834
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,000
If you'd gone to the tryouts,

835
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
you might have qualified.

836
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,440
Don't just practice alone anymore.

837
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,200
You need a partner.

838
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,080
Feel free to call me.

839
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,440
Cheers!
