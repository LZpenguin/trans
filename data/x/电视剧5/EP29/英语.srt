00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,160
Bright Time EP29

3
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Xiaohua!

4
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,160
Hi, Xiaohua!

5
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,520
You're back.

6
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,800
Yes.

7
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,240
Thank you.

8
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,440
Thanks.

9
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
I feel like you're a little unhappy.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Actually, I'm not happy either.

11
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,000
School starts too early.

12
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,920
I haven't had enough vacation.

13
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,760
How could I be happy?

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,320
Did someone bully you

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,880
at the art studio?

16
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,080
Who dared to bully

17
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,920
my disciple?

18
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,200
Tell me.

19
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,040
No.

20
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
Why do you like a frost-eaten plant?

21
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
A frost-beaten plant.

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,200
A frost-beaten plant.

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
I've learned

24
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,520
there's always

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
a bigger fish.

26
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
They're more gifted,

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,680
yet more hard-working.

28
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,400
That's all?

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,360
Doesn't it matter?

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I don't think I can get into Jing University.

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,760
Disciple.

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,720
Good luck always favors

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,680
those who work hard.

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
You didn't have such calluses

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
before you went to intensive training.

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm not as talented

37
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,240
as the others.

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,200
If I don't try harder--

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,680
You've worked very hard.

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,680
Wasn't it after 3:00 a.m.

41
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
the last time you posted a Moment?

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,960
You can't be in the studio

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,000
24 hours a day.

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,480
How long till the exam?

45
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,800
It's over four months away.

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,360
There's nothing else

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
I can do but work.

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,600
You've got 4 months before exam.

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
Don't worry!

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,440
You have to have faith in yourself.

51
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,920
Come on, you're the best.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
But I--

53
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Who said the brush of life

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
should be in her own hands?

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,080
What?

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,160
You're going to give up

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
after such a tiny setback?

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,480
No!

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,920
Then don't worry.

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,360
Remember, don't be influenced by others.

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
Just be yourself.

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,080
We are behind you.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,760
That's right!

64
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,560
Even if you don't believe me,

65
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,440
what about Ling Dong?

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,760
He's the versatile god of our school.

67
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,080
With his support,

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,760
You can win the envy

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,880
of those students in studio.

70
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
You're right. Nobody knows

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,400
who's going to win until the very end.

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,080
Nobody knows!

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,640
Let's go!

74
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,160
Let's go!

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
You two

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,080
are keeping me worried.

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
Captain Chenjun

78
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,520
is almost an agony aunt.

79
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,200
Why are you riding so fast?

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
Is that a challenge?

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
I won't allow anyone

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
to ride faster than me!

83
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,120
Look how fast those boys are riding!

84
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Naive.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Jiang Jing, did you miss me?

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
How was your vacation?

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,600
How was your vacation?

88
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,160
It went too fast.

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
It's over before I even feel it.

90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,680
Yeah.

91
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
It went too fast.

92
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,480
What did you do on vacation?

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,480
I've been busy.

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,880
Welcome back to school,

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Luyang.

96
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Welcome back.

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,120
But don't forget

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,560
to turn in your

99
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
summer homework.

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,880
Okay.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
This is mine.

102
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,040
And this is for you.

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,280
Look at me.

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,440
What's the most important for a man?

105
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,280
It's confidence.

106
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,960
Only if you're confident--

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,680
Jinghui, Jinghui!

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,840
Jinghui!

109
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240
Did you watch the game last night?

110
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,240
Yeah.

111
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,680
Off the glass! Tomahawk dunk!

112
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,440
Amazing!

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,200
I've never seen

114
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
such a good game.

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,000
I tell you,

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,640
James almost had a

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,040
a triple-double last night.

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,840
Ling Dong.

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
These are letters for you.

120
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,280
I brought them for you.

121
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,920
Thank you.

122
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,920
It's okay.

123
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
You got so many letters.

124
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,600
Xu Mengyu,

125
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Don't you have anyone write to you?

126
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Ma Yiming.

127
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,160
Once in a

128
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
blue moon, eh?

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
Eat your egg!

130
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
If you keep bullying me,

131
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,440
I'll tell Mengyu.

132
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

133
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,480
I thought you

134
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
never read letters.

135
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,480
You've changed?

136
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Who's that unlucky girl?

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,480
Su Xi.

138
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,440
Li'l Su.

139
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
Why didn't she write me a postcard?

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,080
Maybe she's not close to you.

141
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm her brother, not you!

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,600
Heartless girl.

143
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,440
She went home without telling me.

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
I've even prepared so many

145
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,200
specialties for her.

146
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,480
Ungrateful.

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
Good to see you again, class.

148
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,720
How's your vacation?

149
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,080
Did you have fun?

150
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,880
Yeah!

151
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
Okay, so before we get to the lesson,

152
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
let me give you a few words.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Time flies.

154
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,800
You're going into

155
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
your senior year.

156
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,320
We all know

157
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,360
the senior year is critical.

158
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,360
But actually,

159
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,960
it's only as special as you imagine.

160
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,640
It's just a small part

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,360
of your life.

162
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,040
In this year,

163
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,080
you don't have to exhaust yourself,

164
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,800
but you should do your best.

165
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,480
You don't have to give up your rest,

166
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,480
but you should grit your teeth.

167
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,200
Of course,

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,960
some of you may choose to give up.

169
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,160
Like most people said,

170
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
like they don't care,

171
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,120
"Whatever.

172
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,280
Work hard or not,

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,040
life continues anyway."

174
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,880
Sweat

175
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,840
or tears,

176
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,120
you have to choose one.

177
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,520
Whether to choose temporary happiness,

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,360
or the bright future.

179
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,840
It's up to you.

180
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,440
Okay.

181
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,840
The class has begun.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Stand up!

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Good morning, Ms. Fang.

184
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,920
Okay, everyone.

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,560
Another thing before I let you go.

186
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
According to Chenjun's tradition,

187
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,840
to improve the efficiency

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,400
of senior students,

189
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
weekly practice tests

190
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,920
will be held,

191
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,280
starting from next week.

192
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,720
Then, based on

193
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,000
your scores in each subject, you will

194
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
be divided into classes for tutoring.

195
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Everybody,

196
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I hope you can study well

197
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,240
before the tests

198
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,080
to get high scores.

199
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,200
Cheer up!

200
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,360
Okay. Class is over.

201
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,280
Stand up.

202
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,600
Good bye, Ms. Fang.

203
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,920
Good bye.

204
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
Why are you so quiet today?

205
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,800
Not even a sound?

206
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,680
Did you feel a bit of pressure

207
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,320
on college entrance exam

208
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
after hearing

209
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,280
Mr. Fong's words?

210
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,760
Do you feel a sense of

211
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,800
"the serenity

212
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,240
before the storm" right now?

213
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,880
Everybody's ready to sprint.

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
It's thrilling

215
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,880
and tantalizing.

216
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,680
Are you a normal human?

217
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
I don't understand

218
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,480
the straight-As.

219
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,600
Don't you think

220
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,080
a little pressure

221
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
is good for us?

222
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,200
No!

223
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,920
Mom.

224
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
Mom, you don't know

225
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
that Li'l Su is too hammy

226
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,280
to finish the task

227
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,720
you gave her.

228
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,720
I knew it right away.

229
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,600
You know it already?

230
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Yeah, of course.

231
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,560
Next time, find someone

232
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,240
more reliable,

233
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,800
or your surprises will be wasted.

234
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,000
I know you're taking me covertly

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,120
to travel to Singapore.

236
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,320
If you want my passport,

237
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,720
she's not the master thief

238
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,920
you are looking for.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
Besides,

240
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,920
aren't you a little

241
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,760
too late?

242
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I'm already in school.

243
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm glad you're here, though.

244
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,120
Yes.

245
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,920
I should've come back earlier.

246
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,000
William was young,

247
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
and in need of care.

248
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
I've been busy at work.

249
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,280
That's why I'm late.

250
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Right, Jinghui.

251
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,400
Do you remember William?

252
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
He's six years old now.

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,560
And he's been looking forward

254
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,520
to seeing his brother.

255
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah, uh, I remember.

256
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
He was a baby

257
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
when I left.

258
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Can't believe

259
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,520
he remembers me.

260
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
Of course he remembers me.

261
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,600
You both are my sons.

262
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
Blood is thicker than water.

263
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,200
Of course, he remembers

264
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,120
he has a brother.

265
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,560
By the way,

266
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,800
mom,

267
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,040
why don't you stay a few more

268
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,080
days this time?

269
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,840
I can

270
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,760
show you around.

271
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,440
Xiangbei

272
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
has changed a lot.

273
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
I think you're the one

274
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,360
who's changed the most.

275
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Am I?

276
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
I remember when you left me

277
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,680
and went back,

278
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,360
you were only a tiny boy.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,640
Suddenly you're a young man now.

280
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,600
Mom.

281
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,520
How about I take tomorrow off

282
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,560
and keep you company, okay?

283
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,920
It's okay.

284
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,880
I'm going back my hometown tomorrow

285
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,800
to see your uncles.

286
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,920
Then,

287
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,680
when are you coming back

288
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
to see me and Grandma?

289
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
I'll visit your Grandma

290
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,560
after I come back.

291
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,280
Is that okay?

292
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,960
Right.

293
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,280
Then,

294
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,240
I'll take you to your

295
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,400
favorite restaurant.

296
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,400
Is it still there?

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Mom.

298
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,720
You still remember it!

299
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,880
Silly boy, of course I remember.

300
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,160
Okay.

301
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,800
Alright.

302
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
It's a deal.

303
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,960
I'll take you home now, okay?

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,960
Okay!

305
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,520
Let's go.

306
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,120
Go!

307
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,360
Oh, my bike.

308
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,120
Okay.

309
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,680
I heard it announced the list of

310
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
candidates for Jing University's

311
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,920
independent enrollment today.

312
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,480
Ling Dong and Chen Luyang are on the list.

313
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,520
Why are you so listless?

314
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,160
I'm worried about the practice tests.

315
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,880
We could be separated afterwards.

316
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,440
If we can

317
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,120
do justice to ourselves in tests,

318
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,840
we're unlikely to be separated.

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But Ling Dong is going to the Top Class.

320
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,200
Yeah.

321
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,080
Then

322
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
Chen Luyang will leave us too.

323
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,360
What is this school doing

324
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,000
by setting this kinda

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,640
tests?

326
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

327
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,120
Since when do you

328
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
care so much about Chen Luyang?

329
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,560
No.

330
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,400
This is just

331
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,920
friendship between classmates.

332
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,840
Really?

333
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,640
Yeah.

334
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,400
Again?

335
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,040
Yes! Have a sweet to keep your mouth shut.

336
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,160
No, I won't.

337
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,840
Xiaohua!

338
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,040
Have you

339
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,120
prepared a speech

340
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,920
for your interview?

341
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,800
Why?

342
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,040
How can you be so casual about this?

343
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,800
Here, I'll help with it.

344
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
After all, I won first place

345
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
in the speech contest.

346
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,320
Really?

347
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,280
Of course!

348
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,880
We're friends.

349
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
You've been

350
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,880
helping me with study before.

351
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm going to help you this time.

352
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Okay.

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,760
Ling Dong.

354
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,840
How about your speech?

355
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,760
It's almost done.

356
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Uh, Ling Dong.

357
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,320
Do you need slides

358
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,840
for your interview?

359
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,400
If you need,

360
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,160
I can help you with slides design.

361
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,800
Though I haven't

362
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,560
won first place in it.

363
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,160
Okay.

364
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,440
I'll let you know if I need it.

365
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,680
Okay, okay.

366
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
You've got a big job ahead of you.

367
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,440
Let's go over there and work on it.

368
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,800
Don't let them hear you.

369
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,480
We wouldn't copy anyway,

370
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,280
okay?

371
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,760
Help me translate these.

372
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,480
That's too many!

373
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,840
Think of it

374
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,240
as practicing your translating skill.

375
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,720
Don't you know

376
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,080
translators charge a lot?

377
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,680
Don't you know

378
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,960
tutoring also charges a lot?

379
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,560
I'll get started.

380
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,640
Help yourself, mom.

381
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,600
Jinghui,

382
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,280
are you tired

383
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,320
after school?

384
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,760
No.

385
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,200
Mom,

386
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,160
did you rest well?

387
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,720
I just didn't sleep well in a new place.

388
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,160
Don't worry.

389
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,600
Okay.

390
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Jinghui, have some tomatoes.

391
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,080
I remember

392
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
you love tomatoes.

393
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,280
Mom, I don't like tomatoes.

394
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,400
Have you forgotten?

395
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,000
I may get it wrong.

396
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,880
Alright.

397
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,040
Have something else.

398
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
Here, take some croquettes.

399
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,560
Kids love them.

400
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:01,920
Okay.

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Mom, mom.

402
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
Look, Look.

403
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,760
Hasn't Xiangbei

404
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,440
changed a lot now?

405
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,120
The tower

406
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,120
didn't got this light before.

407
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,560
It did change.

408
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,120
I used to

409
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,800
bring you here when you were little.

410
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,760
Yeah.

411
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,320
Maybe I ran

412
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,880
too much at the place

413
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,760
in those days.

414
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
That's why they put up railings,

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,680
keeping me from running.

416
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,920
Jinghui.

417
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,000
You've been with me for the past days,

418
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,640
will it delay your studies?

419
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,440
No.

420
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I know I was

421
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,640
a bit behind

422
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,280
in my studies,

423
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,640
but now things are different.

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
I've got a desk mate.

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,640
He's been improving me

426
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,520
on my study.

427
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,720
I've made a little progress, I guess.

428
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,280
And I'm on the

429
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,960
basketball team at school.

430
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm exceptionally fit.

431
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,840
What's wrong, mom?

432
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,200
It's okay.

433
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,880
Jinghui.

434
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,000
You're about to go to college.

435
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,200
You know,

436
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,040
there are a lot of

437
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,640
good universities in Singapore.

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,720
Have you thought about--

439
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,080
Mom.

440
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,160
I seem to know what you mean.

441
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,520
But,

442
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,520
I can always go to Singapore

443
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,440
to visit you, right?

444
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,920
I'm doing

445
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,640
pretty well here now.

446
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,160
The most important thing is

447
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I have a group of friends here.

448
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,840
The desk mate I mentioned,

449
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,200
Ling Dong.

450
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He is

451
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,720
one of the top students

452
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,840
in our school.

453
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,800
And he's a good guy.

454
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,880
I also know

455
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,480
a girl

456
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,760
named Xiao Xiaohua.

457
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,960
She's a bit silly,

458
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,000
but she's...

459
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, she is silly.

460
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,120
How can I put it?

461
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,120
Excuse me.

462
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,280
I have to take this.

463
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,200
Okay.

464
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,640
Hello.

465
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,560
What?

466
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
How's William now?

467
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,960
Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can.

468
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,160
Mom.

469
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,920
Speaking of the contest earlier,

470
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
let me show you

471
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,120
the video from the Talent Show.

472
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,840
This is our show

473
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,680
in the talent contest

474
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,280
I told you before.

475
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,360
The Talent Show

476
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
is a citywide

477
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,920
competition.

478
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,840
I was here.

479
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,960
The others were my classmates.

480
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,520
We had a band.

481
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,360
We played the instruments.

482
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,920
And

483
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,640
the band was called

484
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,680
"Rooftop Crew".

485
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,880
The things is,

486
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
I was not

487
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,600
at the center.

488
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,720
But as a bass player,

489
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,080
I played a central role.

490
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,920
Sory I'm late.

491
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,800
It's fine.

492
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm used to it anyway.

493
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,440
Well...

494
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,560
What do you mean?

495
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,480
I didn't wanna be late either.

496
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,520
I'm really busy at work.

497
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,280
Enough, Lan Shangjin.

498
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,640
I didn't wanna

499
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,320
argue with you.

500
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,720
How have you been?

501
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm here

502
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
to ask you for a favor.

503
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,320
What is it?

504
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,760
I want you to talk to Jinghui for me.

505
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,960
I have to say,

506
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm

507
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,680
good enough that I'm not stopping you

508
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,800
from going to him.

509
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
You want me to persuade him?

510
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,040
Not a chance.

511
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,400
I've already been to

512
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,160
my brothers.

513
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,400
None of them

514
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
were matched.

515
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,880
Now, Jinghui

516
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,200
is the only hope I have.

517
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,720
Haven't you met him already?

518
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,440
What's his opinion?

519
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
I didn't dare to say.

520
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,200
Yu Lihua.

521
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm telling you.

522
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,440
Neither of us

523
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,600
are good parents.

524
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm his father after all.

525
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,640
I have to look out for him.

526
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,680
He has his own dreams now.

527
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,320
I've seen a change

528
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,200
and hard work in him

529
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,880
lately.

530
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,400
Every second

531
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,840
of the senior year

532
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,000
is so important to him,

533
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,600
you know?

534
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,560
Of course I know!

535
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,920
But now I have

536
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,800
no other choice.

537
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,360
That's why you need to

538
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,400
talk to him in person.

539
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,760
The decision is his.

540
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
No one has a right to interfere.

541
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,720
When I came over here,

542
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,760
I saw the candidate of Class 1

543
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,600
wearing a suit.

544
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,520
It looks decent.

545
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Ling Dong, you need to be in suit, too.

546
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Can't lose them on suits.

547
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,920
I think so, too.

548
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,800
Yes.

549
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,160
As the saying goes,

550
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,320
"Clothes make the man."

551
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,160
If you wear a suit,

552
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,960
you'll get into Jing University.

553
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,480
I'll pass.

554
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,520
School uniform works fine.

555
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,480
School uniforms are similar

556
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,560
with suits.

557
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,320
No. if they have it, you must have it too.

558
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Yeah.

559
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,680
Forget it. I'm not wearing a suit.

560
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,280
What?

561
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,880
My dad bought me a lot of suits,

562
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,840
but I never wore them.

563
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,920
I always thought suits

564
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,440
were for good students like you.

565
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:40,960
How about this,

566
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,280
I'll take care of the suit.

567
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,120
I'll bring you one.

568
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
But his size

569
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,840
may be different from yours.

570
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,440
Are you sure he'll fit?

571
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,800
Not that far off.

572
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,080
You'll fit.

573
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,920
Look.

574
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,160
Tomorrow's the weekend.

575
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,480
I'll drop it off at your home.

576
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,160
You try it on.

577
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
No. It's too much trouble.

578
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
What's the trouble?

579
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,880
It's a deal.

580
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,800
I've got something to do. I'm off.

581
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,920
Jinghui, you're leaving now?

582
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,680
What about your study in the evening?

583
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,320
My mom came back.

584
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,840
I'm going to

585
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,240
take her for hot pot.

586
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,760
I'll leave you guys.

587
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,920
I don't need a suit.

588
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,440
I won't wear it.

589
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,000
Who cares?

590
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,120
I'm off. Bye.

591
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,080
Bye. Bye.

592
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,960
I won't wear it.

593
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,440
Hi, do you have a suit?

594
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,360
Yes.

595
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,400
But

596
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't think

597
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,360
they fit me anymore.

598
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,560
If you're free,

599
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,480
can you go with me to buy another one?

600
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,200
Okay.

601
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Tomorrow's the weekend.

602
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,880
We'll meet tomorrow.

603
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,800
Okay.

604
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,720
Thank you.

605
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,480
You're welcome.

606
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,760
You're all helping Ling Dong.

607
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,120
If you wanna play fair,

608
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,720
Luyang needs a suit, too.

609
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,080
Don't follow us tomorrow.

610
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,360
She cares him so much, and she said

611
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,560
there's nothing between them?

612
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,360
She doesn't even want a third wheel.

613
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,440
As the saying goes,

614
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,680
"Always be on guard against your bestie."

615
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,080
I mean Xiao Xiaohua.

616
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,280
What are you talking about?

617
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,440
Do your homework.

618
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,800
Let's go back to the book.

619
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,000
This can also be seen

620
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,280
in the third question we met before.

621
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,600
Hello.

622
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,640
Hello.

623
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,040
Mom, it's me.

624
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,720
Yes.

625
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,520
You can wait me

626
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
at the restaurant.

627
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,240
Okay.

628
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,120
Okay.

629
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,120
Alright, alright.

630
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm going now.

631
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,200
I'll be right there.

632
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,640
I disagree!

633
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,960
If he goes with her

634
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,240
because of that,

635
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,560
he won't be back!

636
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm his grandma.

637
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,280
How can I see

638
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,120
my grandson suffering?

639
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,240
Mom, it's not as bad as you said.

640
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,160
I don't want him to go, either.

641
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,840
But that's a boy's life.

642
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,120
Look,

643
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,240
Jinghui and William

644
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,200
are half-brothers.

645
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
Jinghui is very likely to be

646
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,960
a perfect donor match.

647
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,760
It's bone marrow

648
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
we're talking about!

649
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,080
It's hard for me to think about

650
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,960
he'll have surgery.

651
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
If there's aftereffects,

652
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,240
how am I supposed to take it?

653
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,120
He's not even there yet.

654
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:33,920
Besides,

655
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,480
he may not have to have surgery.

656
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Since Yu Lihua came back,

657
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,440
look at Jinghui,

658
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,680
he's so happy to see his mother!

659
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,960
Every time I remember

660
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,280
she had promised to

661
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,440
take Jinghui

662
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,040
abroad with her,

663
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,440
but then sent him back

664
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,320
alone,

665
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm heart-broken for

666
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,760
his suffering when he's abroad.

667
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
In all these years,

668
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,040
she hasn't come back to see him.

669
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,920
When she has trouble,

670
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,760
when she has trouble,

671
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,960
she'd like to turn to him?

672
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,640
The senior year

673
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,080
is very critical to him.

674
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,520
Shangjin.

675
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't care about your opinion.

676
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,440
I won't let him go anyway.

677
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,360
Your brother William

678
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,960
was diagnosed with leukemia.

679
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,520
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

680
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,200
They've checked all of his relatives.

681
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,240
None of them

682
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,800
is a match.

683
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,640
Now you're your mother's

684
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,640
only hope left.

685
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,560
Jinghui, I'm sorry.

686
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,160
I know I'm being selfish.

687
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,720
Mom.

688
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,840
I know what you're going to say.

689
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
I'll go with you to see if I'm a match.

690
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,880
Jinghui.

691
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,680
If you don't wanna go,

692
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,800
no one will force you.

693
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,520
It's a surgery you'll go through.

694
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
It's okay, Grandma.

695
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
William is my brother.

696
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,800
I would have helped even if

697
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,520
my mom hadn't begged me.

698
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,160
So don't worry.

699
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,560
Mom, when are we leaving?

700
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,280
I need to pack.

701
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,360
William is not well.

702
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,040
We should leave as soon as possible.

703
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,320
Okay.

704
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,000
We'll leave the day after tomorrow.

705
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,880
I have

706
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,520
things to do tomorrow.

707
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
Because I know Jing University...

708
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,240
Hello. What's the matter?

709
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,120
Well,

710
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm downstairs.

711
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,000
Are you at home?

712
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,160
I'm here to bring you the suit.

713
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,120
I said I don't need it.

714
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,160
I really don't need it.

715
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,280
Besides, I'm not at home right now.

716
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
I'm waiting for Mr. Zhang

717
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,480
for interview practicing.

718
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,320
I'll be busy on Monday.

719
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,360
Your mom's home, isn't she?

720
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,840
She...

721
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,040
Alright. Fine.

722
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,920
How's this?

723
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
I'll just send it in.

724
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,800
Is that okay?

725
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,520
I have another thing to tell you.

726
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,160
What is it?

727
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,600
Ling Dong, your turn.

728
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,840
I'll see you later.

729
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,560
You can tell me then.

730
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,320
It's my turn now.

731
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,280
Okay.

732
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,000
Then,

733
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,400
I'll see you and tell you face-to-face.

734
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,520
Face-to-face?

735
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,200
What happened?

736
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
You'll see when you come back.

737
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,880
See you.

738
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
Who is it?

739
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Jinghui!

740
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,000
Come on in!

741
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,760
Come on in!

742
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,480
Thanks.

743
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,680
Weirdie,

744
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
aren't you just like this?

745
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,560
You look like this!

746
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's go on a space trip together

747
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
when we grow up, okay?

748
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,640
I promise

749
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,000
to be your friend forever.

750
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
You need to promise, too.

751
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
Why does Ling Dong have this painting?

752
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,560
My mom and dad are arguing again.

753
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,720
Mom said she'll take me away.

754
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,720
Does it mean we'll never see

755
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,880
each other again?

756
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,080
I don't wanna go.

757
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,600
What would you do if your mom

758
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,240
insisted on taking you away?

759
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,280
I could hide.

760
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,200
Hide? Where to hide?

761
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,000
Here.

762
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
This is our secret base.

763
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,760
No one can find me here.

764
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,040
I'll come out after my mom leaves.

765
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,720
Okay!

766
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,720
You must keep my secret.

767
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
You can't tell anyone.

768
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,880
Pinkie promise!

769
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,360
Jinghui!

770
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,400
Jinghui!

771
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,440
Jinghui! Jinghui!

772
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,880
Jinghui!

773
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,600
Jinghui! Jinghui!

774
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,640
Jinghui! Jinghui!

775
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,280
Jinghui!

776
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,160
Jinghui! Jinghui!

777
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,000
Jinghui!

778
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,840
Jinghui!

779
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,520
Liar!

780
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,000
Okay.

781
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
Stabilize.

782
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
Don't get nervous.

783
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,920
Lower your chin.

784
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,800
Smooth your shirt.

785
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,280
Smooth it.

786
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,720
Okay, okay.

787
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,440
Just a bit. Just a bit.

788
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,840
It's alright.

789
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,520
Get ready.

790
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,880
Three, two, one.

791
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,560
Your name?

792
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,160
I don't think

793
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,440
this is necessary.

794
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,760
Why isn't it necessary?

795
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,160
You're going to have an interview.

796
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,560
So you need to practice.

797
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,760
Am I right, disciple?

798
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,680
He got points.

799
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,200
Your name?

800
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,360
Ling Dong.

801
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,160
Any strengths?

802
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,160
I have no flaws.

803
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,200
You wanna be funny?

804
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,880
Alright.

805
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,720
Try to compliment your desk mate

806
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,120
in a glamorous way.

807
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,920
Stop it, Lan Jinghui.

808
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,200
I'm just kidding.

809
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,880
Give it to me.

810
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,120
I've collected the interview questions

811
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,840
of independent enrollment

812
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,640
in previous years and

813
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,520
corresponding answers for you.

814
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,600
Now,

815
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm going to pick

816
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:26,920
some tough ones

817
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
to test you.

818
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Ready?
