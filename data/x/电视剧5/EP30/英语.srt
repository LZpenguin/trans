00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,080
Bright Time EP30

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,600
Mom.

4
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,120
You're back.

5
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,720
Where's Lan?

6
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
He went home.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,960
And, he hung the clothes

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,360
in your room.

9
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,200
Whatcha doing in the kitchen?

10
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,360
Making your

11
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,400
breakfast for tomorrow.

12
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
You're gonna have that

13
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,640
JU exam, right?

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,120
Rest up and get ready.

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Alright, good night.

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Oh, he's quite slim.

17
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,760
Dad.

18
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,600
What's up?

19
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,960
Changing the SIM card?

20
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,680
Chill out.

21
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,520
Just change it when you get there.

22
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,680
What if

23
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,600
someone tries to reach you?

24
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,320
Nah.

25
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,640
I've hit up everyone

26
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,040
who needs to know.

27
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,040
Okay.

28
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,560
Just be safe

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
when you get there,

30
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
and let me know if you

31
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
need anything.

32
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,760
Got it.

33
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,560
Alright.

34
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,040
Dad.

35
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,440
Good night.

36
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,040
Don't be tardy for the interview.

37
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
And put on that suit

38
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Jinghui gave you.

39
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,280
Yeah, mom.

40
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,160
Mom.

41
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,440
You moved my painting?

42
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,600
No.

43
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,120
What's up?

44
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
Nothing.

45
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,640
Sorry.

46
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
The number you dialed is powered off.

47
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,840
Chen Luyang,

48
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,000
a senior from Chenjun.

49
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,080
It's your turn.

50
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,880
Good day, esteemed teachers.

51
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,720
Thanks, school, for this chance

52
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
to share my dreams.

53
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,680
Let's start with my intro.

54
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
My name is Chen Luyang,

55
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,680
and I'm from Xingsha.

56
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,240
How's the interview?

57
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,040
Not bad.

58
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,000
Good then.

59
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
You ate that lucky candy

60
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,680
I gave you?

61
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,520
Of course.

62
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,400
It helped.

63
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
I was less tense.

64
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,960
Ling Dong.

65
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,560
How's your interview?

66
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,240
It should be okay.

67
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,680
Where's Lan?

68
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,840
He'll go overseas.

69
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
He texted me

70
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,080
last night,

71
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,840
his plane leaves at 3 pm today.

72
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Right, I got it too.

73
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,480
Strange,

74
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,880
he's gonna leave like that?

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
I told you his mom

76
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,440
was taking him to Singapore,

77
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,640
but no one believed me.

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Is he coming back for gaokao?

79
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,320
Why would he?

80
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,440
He'll probably just stay there.

81
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,680
He didn't tell you?

82
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,840
Ling Dong.

83
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
He probably didn't

84
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
want to distract you.

85
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Ling Dong.

86
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,560
Ling Dong.

87
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
It's time for the written exam.

88
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,120
You've got this!

89
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,760
Go!

90
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,920
Go for it!

91
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,280
Let's go.

92
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Lan Jinghui.

93
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,040
You liar,

94
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,280
liar!

95
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
Huge liar!

96
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,880
Huge liar!

97
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,960
Huge liar!

98
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,320
Clownfish.

99
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,840
Lan Jinghui.

100
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,960
Lan Jinghui.

101
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,720
Clownfish.

102
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,680
Clownfish.

103
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,240
Clownfish.

104
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,120
Clownfish.

105
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,040
Clownfish.

106
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,640
Chen Luyang really pulled it off.

107
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,880
Yeah.

108
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
He topped the exam.

109
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,600
Incredible!

110
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
He surpassed

111
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,200
Ling Dong this time.

112
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
After Lan left,

113
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,800
everything seemed

114
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,000
to be the same as before,

115
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,560
but I felt

116
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,680
something changed.

117
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,320
We humans

118
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
always miss what's gone.

119
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,440
We only realize

120
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,160
how much we need someone

121
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,080
once he's gone.

122
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
Hey, slowpoke.

123
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Finally!

124
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
I held this spot for you.

125
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,000
Ling Dong.

126
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,320
I wish I had realized sooner

127
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,320
how you felt about me.

128
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,400
Lan Jinghui.

129
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,680
I'm gonna be your uncle for life,

130
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,280
for real.

131
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,880
Wanna get a free ride for life, huh?

132
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,720
Good luck with that!

133
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,160
Trust me?

134
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,040
Nah.

135
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,240
This is the first

136
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
simulated exam,

137
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,280
so I hope you all bring

138
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
your best game.

139
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,720
It's not just a review

140
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,600
of all the knowledge,

141
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,640
but also a mock exam for gaokao.

142
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,920
It'll give you a clear picture

143
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
of your current standing.

144
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Class's over.

145
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,320
Stand up.

146
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,520
Thank you, Ma'am.

147
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,560
See you, guys.

148
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
He's been gone ages,

149
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,240
and no word from him.

150
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,240
Is he never coming back?

151
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Who knows?

152
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,480
Parents nowadays,

153
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
they think sending kids

154
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,480
abroad fixes everything.

155
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,880
I knew his mom

156
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,400
was taking him

157
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,680
overseas.

158
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,720
Nonsense.

159
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,960
That can't be true.

160
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,320
Did he reach out to you?

161
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,360
Nope.

162
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,760
If we had known

163
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,920
he wasn't coming back,

164
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,040
we should've

165
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,520
thrown him a farewell party.

166
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,880
Now he's gone.

167
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
And we'll be reassigned.

168
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,880
It's sad.

169
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,400
Class begins.

170
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Stand up.

171
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,960
Good morning, Ma'am.

172
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,400
Morning, sit down please.

173
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,160
Please

174
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,920
turn to page 39.

175
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,840
We're

176
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,320
gonna do a quick review.

177
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,040
Last time,

178
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,880
we dug into Du Fu's

179
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,440
poem "A Night in Chamber".

180
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Now, let's

181
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,400
go over the main idea

182
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,760
and how the poem's

183
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,360
put together.

184
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,520
Ling Dong.

185
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,200
Ma'am's got your name.

186
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
Ling Dong.

187
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,360
Stay focused.

188
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,600
The first round of review

189
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,200
is important.

190
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Put your hearts into it.

191
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,080
Stay focused.

192
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
Alright, we studied

193
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
Du Fu's poem.

194
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,200
Ling Dong, check this out.

195
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,080
B's the answer.

196
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
B?

197
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,880
Why?

198
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,880
B?

199
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,040
B's the one.

200
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,920
B?

201
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,360
Exhausted.

202
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,040
All we do is study and study.

203
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,920
The vibe's so heavy.

204
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,760
I miss Class 5,

205
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,280
where Lan Jinghui

206
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,080
would crack jokes

207
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
whenever we got tired.

208
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,000
He kept

209
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,080
things lively.

210
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,040
Remember that

211
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,960
hilarious one he told?

212
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,560
Which one?

213
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,360
Kid's been busy with

214
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,200
his high school studies, and his

215
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
parents care deeply about his grades.

216
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,960
One noon, he's shampooing up,

217
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,640
and Dad walks in,

218
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,160
"Whatcha washing there?"

219
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,560
Kid says, "I'm washing my hair."

220
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,000
Dad's like,

221
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
"Don't waste your time."

222
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,600
"Go take a nap."

223
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,680
"Put your head down, I'll wash it."

224
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,800
Can you keep it down?

225
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,720
I've been busting my butt

226
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
teaching you ball,

227
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,480
shouldn't you

228
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,720
address me as...

229
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Cuz.

230
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,240
I'm your uncle.

231
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,800
Come on, cuz.

232
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,920
One hand on the ball,

233
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,720
cut to the side,

234
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,320
three steps.

235
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,840
Shoot!

236
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,600
Try it.

237
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
I told you.

238
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
For the three-step shot,

239
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,920
if you squat too low,

240
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,680
you won't get that jump.

241
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,200
You're back?

242
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,240
What's up?

243
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,680
Weirdie. Don't you wanna see me?

244
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,040
Sorry.

245
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,680
I actually recognized you

246
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,760
as Clownfish way back,

247
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
but I couldn't bring up

248
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,040
our childhood stuff.

249
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,280
I didn't mean to

250
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,880
betray you.

251
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,800
And it's been

252
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,800
weighing on me

253
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,840
for years.

254
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,840
When I realized it was you,

255
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,680
I wanted to tell you.

256
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,600
But

257
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,240
I was all tongue-tied.

258
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,120
I was afraid you'd...

259
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,040
Dude, what's up?

260
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,000
Come on, let's ball out!

261
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm good.

262
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,360
I'm good.

263
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,440
Mom.

264
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,240
Jinghui.

265
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,960
How do you feel?

266
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,880
Much better.

267
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,200
Jinghui.

268
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,920
I made chicken soup.

269
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,200
Load up

270
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,840
on the good stuff,

271
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
so you get better soon.

272
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,880
How's William doing?

273
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,160
He's fine.

274
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,560
The docs are on it.

275
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,240
Don't worry.

276
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,600
Okay.

277
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,200
Here, sip some soup,

278
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,320
take it slow.

279
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
Tastes good?

280
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,360
Yeah.

281
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,040
Mom.

282
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
Your cooking's still top-notch

283
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
after all these years.

284
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,640
If you like it,

285
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,000
I'll cook soup for you every day.

286
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,840
Yeah.

287
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,160
Jinghui.

288
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,280
I wanna talk to you about something.

289
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:01,960
Yeah.

290
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,520
You know,

291
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,240
your dad's got a demanding job,

292
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
and grandma's health

293
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,320
isn't what it used to be.

294
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Would you stay and

295
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,320
study in Singapore?

296
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,320
I'd love to have you around.

297
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,680
I know I wasn't there

298
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,520
for you.

299
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,680
But I wanna make it up

300
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,880
to you both.

301
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,000
Will you give me

302
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,960
a chance?

303
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Everyone.

304
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,840
Today is the first day

305
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,160
of the 2nd semester,

306
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
which means that

307
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,440
all of you here are

308
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,440
entering the final sprint

309
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
of gaokao.

310
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,520
What is gaokao?

311
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Gaokao's a mountain

312
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,800
we gotta conquer.

313
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,840
Only by

314
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,720
reaching the top

315
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,720
can we see the view.

316
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,040
Brave hearts

317
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,400
never shy away from challenges,

318
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,840
they keep pushing limits

319
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
and making history.

320
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,160
I believe that you

321
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,960
will be the creators

322
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,640
of Chenjun's glorious history.

323
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,680
Today, you honor your school,

324
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,800
tomorrow,

325
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,520
your school will honor you.

326
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,600
Now, I hereby announce that this year,

327
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,760
a total of 519 warriors

328
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
will rock

329
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,120
the exam!

330
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,960
No. It's 520.

331
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Surprise!

332
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,400
Jinghui, you're back!

333
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,000
Jinghui.

334
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
Alright, settle down.

335
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,560
Sit down.

336
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
Especially you, Ma Yiming.

337
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,840
Calm down.

338
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,920
Jinghui.

339
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,920
Jinghui.

340
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,880
Chill out, sit.

341
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,120
Sit, sit, sit.

342
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,440
Sit.

343
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,520
Lan Jinghui.

344
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,520
Yes.

345
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,360
What's the fuss?

346
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,960
Late on the first day?

347
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,200
Be seated.

348
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,280
Yes, sir.

349
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,360
Sit here.

350
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,920
Jinghui.

351
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,360
Long time no see.

352
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,600
After you.

353
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:33,960
Take it easy.

354
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,680
My back.

355
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,440
I missed you.

356
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,000
We missed you a lot.

357
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,440
Just had surgery.

358
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,560
Alright, enough.

359
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,640
Man, don't be like that.

360
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,080
Okay. Now.

361
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,080
Correction.

362
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,880
I hereby announce that

363
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,640
this year, a total of

364
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,760
520 warriors will

365
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,840
take the exam.

366
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,800
Yeah!

367
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,800
Now, let's do this.

368
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,200
I'll say one, two, three,

369
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,920
and we all yell "Go Team!"

370
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,720
Yeah.

371
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,160
One, two, three.

372
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,040
Go Team!

373
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,960
Mom.

374
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,480
I wanna go back.

375
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,520
Why?

376
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,000
Wouldn't you like to stay

377
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,760
and be with me?

378
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,680
Mom.

379
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,000
I left to give you

380
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
a better life,

381
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,480
and I'm back

382
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,560
for the same reason.

383
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,120
Please. Don't feel

384
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,720
guilty, it's what I

385
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,040
wanted to do.

386
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,360
You know.

387
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,440
You have your own life to live,

388
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,960
and I have mine.

389
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,960
Plus, I have

390
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
my buds and

391
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,160
grandma back in China.

392
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
The thing is,

393
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,480
I gotta be there

394
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,120
for my dad,

395
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,680
he might get a bit lonely

396
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,640
sometimes.

397
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,200
You can always

398
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,240
visit them often.

399
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,640
Mom.

400
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,800
I haven't told you

401
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
that I wanna apply to JU.

402
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,680
I know

403
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
I slacked off

404
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,960
before,

405
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,200
but now I

406
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,080
have a clear goal

407
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,160
and I wanna fight

408
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,760
for it.

409
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,440
So, mom.

410
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
I wanna go back.

411
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,040
Looks like

412
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,000
you've made your choice.

413
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,760
I won't force you.

414
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,120
Just promise to

415
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,520
visit me whenever

416
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,200
you can, alright?

417
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,560
I promise.

418
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Alright, have some soup.

419
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,840
Take it slow.

420
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,160
Did you miss me

421
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,920
when I wasn't around?

422
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,200
Feel like a ship without a rudder

423
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,320
when I'm unreachable?

424
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,120
Feel lost without

425
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,640
your deskmate?

426
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,560
Not really.

427
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,680
New class,

428
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
new deskmate.

429
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,480
No distractions.

430
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,840
I was over the moon.

431
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,520
Just me and my books.

432
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,360
Plus, I get to help out

433
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,160
my classmates.

434
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:27,840
Yeah?

435
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,560
If that's the case,

436
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,120
why

437
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,200
all the texts

438
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,440
and calls?

439
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,840
Ling Dong, no offense.

440
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,640
But you're always like this.

441
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,440
So reserved.

442
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,840
So petty.

443
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
You think I'm like you,

444
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,640
right?

445
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,960
I'm not.

446
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,320
I'm not gonna

447
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,200
flip out just because you didn't

448
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,360
tell me about childhood stuff.

449
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,400
I have never been

450
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,400
a petty person

451
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,680
like that.

452
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,160
You saw my text?

453
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,480
You saw my text.

454
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,400
Why no reply?

455
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,920
And you say you're

456
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,200
not mad,

457
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,160
but why did you

458
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,720
run off to another country

459
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,400
without a word?

460
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,200
Why hold out on me?

461
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,640
Why?

462
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,400
Yeah.

463
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,800
I know it was my fault

464
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,680
when we were kids,

465
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,760
but bailing on me

466
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,720
without saying a word

467
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
like that?

468
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,800
You have no idea

469
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,520
how much I've been

470
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,400
worrying and missing you.

471
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,840
Alright.

472
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,040
We're even.

473
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,360
You kept your identity

474
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,200
a secret too.

475
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,120
Why'd you leave

476
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,280
and come back?

477
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,240
I had to go overseas

478
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,120
because I'm the only one

479
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,200
who can save my little bro

480
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,680
with

481
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
a bone marrow match.

482
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,960
A bone marrow match?

483
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,560
So...

484
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,880
Did you end up being a match?

485
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,200
I...

486
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,520
You been stuck in the hospital?

487
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,880
Are you okay?

488
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,120
So many questions.

489
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Where do I even

490
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,920
begin?

491
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,920
Now's not the time for humor.

492
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,680
Hey, take it easy.

493
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm cool.

494
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,880
Take your time.

495
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,240
Really?

496
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,600
I'm fine.

497
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,600
I'm buzzing with life.

498
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,400
You're not still pouting, are you?

499
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,400
Lan Jinghui.

500
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,680
I'll be honest

501
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,880
with you from now on.

502
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,600
Me too.

503
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,360
I promise I'll never lie to you again.

504
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,920
Me too.

505
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,960
I'll support you in your studies.

506
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,320
Me too.

507
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,960
Let's go for JU together.

508
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,200
Go for JU together.

509
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,080
You're back.

510
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,320
You scared me.

511
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,720
You're still up? It's late.

512
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,520
It's half past eleven.

513
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,000
You're pretty tipsy.

514
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,120
Leave me be, I'm good.

515
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,600
I'll grab you some water.

516
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,080
I'm fine.

517
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,080
Just go to bed.

518
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,520
Senior year

519
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,760
is crucial.

520
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,280
I know.

521
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,440
Finish this.

522
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,320
What's this?

523
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,920
Why is it sweet?

524
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,160
It's honey water.

525
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,080
Tea's the cure.

526
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,320
That's not true.

527
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,560
Tea at this time

528
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,840
can worsen

529
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
your drunk state

530
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,480
and is not good

531
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,240
for your health.

532
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,360
Yeah?

533
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,840
Tea's always been my go-to.

534
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,920
Just because you do it all the time

535
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,560
doesn't make it right.

536
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,880
Change can be good.

537
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,040
You're not

538
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
pulling my leg because

539
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm buzzed, are you?

540
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,760
If you're not too drunk,

541
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,880
let me ask you a question.

542
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:54,960
What?

543
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,280
Did you know

544
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,480
my mom

545
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,440
asked about staying in

546
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,520
Singapore?

547
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah.

548
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,680
So, you wanted me

549
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
to stay there, huh?

550
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,800
Son, you're grown up.

551
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,200
You gotta

552
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,440
make your own decision.

553
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,320
And besides,

554
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,240
Singapore's pretty great.

555
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,040
Alright, I know.

556
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,320
Another question.

557
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,840
After the divorce,

558
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,520
did you ever wanna

559
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,520
get me a new mom?

560
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,000
You little rascal.

561
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,880
You...

562
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,160
Mind your own business.

563
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,640
I don't want you to

564
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,280
be alone when you're old.

565
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,880
Right?

566
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,080
With your looks and charm,

567
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,280
if you find someone special,

568
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,800
just go for it.

569
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,560
And

570
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,880
when I'm off

571
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,440
to college, you can

572
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,680
do whatever floats your boat.

573
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,360
Are you kidding?

574
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm a catch!

575
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,360
And hey,

576
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,280
let's get you into

577
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,920
that university first.

578
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,680
Staying up late just to

579
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,160
give me

580
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,480
a hard time, huh?

581
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,600
And, you know...

582
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,200
I...

583
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm just curious,

584
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,840
where do you go

585
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
so late every day?

586
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,600
It seems like you're

587
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,240
never home at night.

588
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,160
Just out networking.

589
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,280
What else would I be up to?

590
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,200
Finish your water and

591
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,120
hit the hay.

592
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,360
Also,

594
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,400
stop

595
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,520
sneaking in

596
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,400
like a burglar.

597
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,080
I'm dead to the world up there,

598
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,400
won't even notice.

599
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,600
Got it?

600
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

601
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,160
Last but not least,

602
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,040
don't burn yourself out

603
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,480
chasing after money.

604
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,520
You know?

605
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,560
I'll be bringing in

606
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,400
the bacon soon.

607
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,200
Right?

608
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

609
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,320
And besides...

610
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,720
I wanna say...

612
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,120
I know, I know.

613
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
You know.

614
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,760
You...

615
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,320
Easy on

616
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,200
the criticism.

617
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,200
That was

618
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
too much

619
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,160
for me.

620
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,320
Please, go to sleep.

621
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,720
Okay.

622
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,120
We'll chat about it later.

623
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,640
What now?

624
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,600
Don't forget.

625
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,760
What?

626
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,680
About finding someone new.

627
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,360
Little rascal.

628
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,000
Good night, dad.

629
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,000
Prove that A2, A5,

630
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,760
and A8 form an arithmetic sequence.

631
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,240
Given that S3, S6, and S9

632
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,440
form an arithmetic sequence,

633
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,480
we have S3 + S6

634
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,880
= 2Sq,

635
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,880
and q does not equal 1.

636
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,080
1 - q/A1

637
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,400
x (1-q^3)

638
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,640
+ 1 - q/A1

639
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,480
x 1-q^6

640
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,080
= 1 - q/2A1.

641
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,320
Therefore, A2, A5,

642
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,520
and A8 form an arithmetic sequence.

643
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,920
There's another

644
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,840
formula to solve this

645
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
which is

646
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,200
a bit more difficult.

647
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,160
I'll write it on the blackboard.

648
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,480
Try to keep it in mind.

649
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,680
This is the

650
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,400
formula.

651
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,320
Give it

652
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,040
a shot

653
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,880
-Ms. Fang. -after class.

654
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,280
Ms. Fang.

655
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,640
It's break time.

656
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I know.

657
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,360
Class's over.

658
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,120
Stand up.

659
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,480
Thank you, Ma'am.

660
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,400
See you, guys.

661
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Ling Dong.

662
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,440
Listen,

663
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,800
you've got

664
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,520
quite some

665
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,560
catching up to do.

666
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,920
I've got some practices

667
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,840
for you.

668
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,400
Okay.

669
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,040
This.

670
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,160
Focus on lines and

671
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,760
hyperbolas'

672
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,680
interactions.

673
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,560
Key section.

674
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,600
Page 73, huh?

675
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,440
Yeah. Page 73.

676
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,360
And this.

677
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,520
Two defs of hyperbola...

678
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,600
See you after school?

679
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,520
Sure.

680
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,800
But I'll be a bit late.

681
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,080
Okay.

682
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,800
I'll be waiting for you.

683
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,440
Yeah.

684
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,520
See you.

685
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,200
I'll be there.

686
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,720
See you, bye.
