Bright Time EP16

3
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,760
People often wonder,

4
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,120
why bother trying our hardest

5
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,320
if the result

6
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,240
might not be perfect?

7
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,080
Some say that

8
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
it's so that when it's all over,

9
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
we can say with a clear conscience

10
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,080
that I really gave it

11
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,720
my all.

12
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
No matter how much you love it,

13
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
how badly you want it,

14
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
and how much you

15
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,760
sweat and toil for it,

16
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
your dream may not

17
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,000
necessarily come true.

18
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,640
Youth's not always picture-perfect.

19
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,640
Tomorrow might not bring sunshine, and

20
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,400
you might still fall short in the end,

21
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
but you gotta keep

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,320
pushing forward,

23
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,680
That's just

24
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,960
how it is when you're young.

25
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
Good morning, Ling Dong.

26
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Morning, Xiaohua.

27
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Well...

28
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
yesterday's game

29
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
was awesome.

30
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
But it's a pity that we just needed

31
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
one more goal.

32
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,200
Can't believe

33
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,760
he scored

34
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,040
in the last few seconds.

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
We let our guard down.

36
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
So...

37
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
I know you're

38
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
probably bummed out today,

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,840
but as the cheerleader,

40
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,880
I gotta stay positive.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,960
I specially made

42
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
the hearty breakfast

43
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,840
to give you a boost.

44
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,600
That's way too much for just me.

45
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,520
This one's for Lan Jinghui.

46
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,480
Thank you.

47
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,520
I think he probably

48
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
needs it more than I do.

49
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you, Xiaohua.

50
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,560
Um,

51
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
off to class.

52
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,000
Is Jinghui okay?

53
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't know.

54
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
He's not answering

55
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,000
my calls or texts.

56
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
C'mon,

57
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
it's just a game, isn't it?

58
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,880
You don't know how important

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,200
this is to him.

60
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,360
It was his shot

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,320
at the youth team.

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,920
Yeah.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,320
To lose it like this,

64
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,120
won't he just be crushed

65
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
and never come back from it?

66
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
Just make sure when you see him later,

67
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,360
don't say anything

68
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,400
that'll upset him.

69
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,640
What's the secret plan, guys?

70
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,000
Ash Lan!

71
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,120
You did all these?

72
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
What happened to you?

73
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,080
Why are you guys so late?

74
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
You know what they say,

75
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
make the most

76
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,200
of your mornings.

77
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's time to up our game,

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
to improve

79
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,000
the quality

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,960
of our lives,

81
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
and not waste

82
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
our youth lounging around.

83
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,360
You don't have a fever, do you?

84
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,920
Listen.

85
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,440
Most of the things

86
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
we encounter in life

87
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,360
are not going to be perfect,

88
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,720
but we should move on.

89
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,640
Good boy.

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
He's right.

91
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
Here. I specifically made

92
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,440
this breakfast for you.

93
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
It will

94
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
fill you up.

95
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,880
Just remember,

96
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,240
we got your back,

97
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,120
no matter

98
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,800
what.

99
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Jinghui.

100
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,760
Jinghui.

101
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
You alright?

102
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,360
Are you okay?

103
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Jinghui.

104
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
Can we go to your place tonight

105
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,600
and game it up?

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,960
I'm stuck on a bunch of levels!

107
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,880
Nah, forget it!

108
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,360
Finals are coming up!

109
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,680
I gotta hit the books.

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
After all, I am

111
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Captain Chenjun!

112
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,520
Are you flexing on me

113
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
with your perfect score?

114
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,440
Check this out.

115
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,400
I made a mistake,

116
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,040
and it was

117
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,000
a really silly one.

118
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,200
So what?

119
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,440
Even a

120
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
straight A student like me

121
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,040
would make mistakes.

122
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,280
It's the same

123
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,560
for everyone.

124
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,680
You...

125
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,800
What?

126
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,960
Homework.

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,040
From yesterday.

128
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
After everything that went down,

129
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
I didn't feel like doing anything.

130
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:58,960
Yesterday...

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,880
C'mon... alright...

132
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm gonna catch up

133
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,080
on them.

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,680
Class begins.

135
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,560
Stand up.

136
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,000
Good morning, ma'am.

137
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,560
Good morning. Sit down please.

138
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,480
We all saw

139
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
the basketball game results.

140
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,640
It's unfortunate

141
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,800
that we lost to Class 8.

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,200
But

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,640
we are

144
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
not done.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Finals are around the corner.

146
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,800
Gonna let them

147
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,760
win again?

148
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,480
No!

149
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,000
Good.

150
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
I've got three stacks

151
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,320
of test papers for you.

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,480
I'll pass them

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,240
around.

154
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Listen up!

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Lan Jinghui made

156
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
significant progress

157
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,440
during the last midterm,

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,920
proof that study groups work.

159
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,520
So I suggest you

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
make your own

161
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,520
groups,

162
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,320
help each other out,

163
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,560
and improve together.

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,920
Okay?

165
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,800
Yes.

166
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,120
Can we

167
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,920
pick our own crew?

168
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,640
Yeah.

169
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,320
You can decide

170
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
for yourselves.

171
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,360
Qingtian.

172
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,080
How about you,

173
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
me, and Xiao Xiaohua

174
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
form a study group?

175
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,000
I can help you.

176
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,440
Impossible.

177
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,320
Xiaohua is gonna join Ling Dong's crew.

178
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Ma Yiming.

179
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
Wanna be in

180
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,400
our study group?

181
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,360
Nah,

182
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
I'm joining Mengyu's team.

183
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Qingtian.

184
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,720
Honestly,

185
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,280
a study duo

186
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
is the best way to go,

187
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
it's really efficient.

188
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,480
Really?

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,520
Let's eat.

190
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay.

191
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,280
You done?

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,520
Yeah.

193
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's go.

194
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,120
Okay.

195
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,000
- Xiao Xiaohua. - Xiaohua.

196
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
- Take this drumstick. - This is for you.

197
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
Why are you...

198
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,720
We want you to join

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
our study group.

200
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,400
Yeah. Join us.

201
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,800
Daily drumstick on us.

202
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
Nah, I'm good.

203
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,240
Here, take some pork too.

204
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,640
Take it.

205
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,160
Take this.

206
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,080
And mine.

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,560
It's all yours.

208
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,200
Here, take this too.

209
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,840
Thanks.

210
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,640
Xiaohua said that

211
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,760
she's joining our crew.

212
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,320
Lan Jinghui.

213
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,480
It's for Xiaohua!

214
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,480
What are you doing?

215
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,920
She won't be able to finish all these.

216
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
But why did you make

217
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
a decision for her?

218
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,440
She hasn't given her word yet.

219
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,160
Right!

220
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,640
Xiaohua, tell me...

221
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,120
Xiaohua, here.

222
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,280
Who's your pick for the group?

223
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,320
Ling Dong

224
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,720
and Lan Jinghui.

225
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,480
You hear that?

226
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
She chose it

227
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
herself.

228
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
You better bounce, quick.

229
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,400
I want it back.

230
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,960
Eat by yourself.

231
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,160
Meet me at

232
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,240
the study room after school, on the dot.

233
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,320
Got it, I'll be there sharp.

234
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,800
Well...

235
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
Congrats on our

236
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
three-people group!

237
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,880
Congrats!

238
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,760
Brilliant!

239
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,320
Qingtian.

240
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,560
I've never seen you this serious

241
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,840
about your homework before.

242
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
It's all because of Chen Luyang.

243
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,400
He's promised to buy me

244
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,360
lots of snacks

245
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,680
if I do my homework well.

246
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,960
You know me,

247
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
how can I

248
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
resist snacks?

249
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Hi, Doudou.

250
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,600
I think he has

251
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,160
a thing for you.

252
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
Nah,

253
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,720
he's just keen on face-saving.

254
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,240
He can't tolerate

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
Ling Dong having a greater

256
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,640
impact on you

257
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
than he has on me.

258
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Do I need to play dumb

259
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,000
to make him

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
feel better?

261
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,600
Who do you think you are, huh?

262
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,840
I've been doing

263
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,160
really well lately,

264
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
I'm in the zone.

265
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,120
Anyway, Xiaohua.

266
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,920
You've been acting

267
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
differently these days.

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
In what way?

269
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,280
Like with

270
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,720
this study group thing,

271
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
you declined Lu Yao's offer.

272
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,880
You never would've

273
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,640
done that before,

274
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,800
you're not the "yes" girl

275
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,280
anymore, huh?

276
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,640
Do you think

277
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm gonna getting better?

278
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,360
Of course you are.

279
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,520
You're in

280
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,480
Ling Dong's group.

281
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,440
Even Lan Jinghui

282
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,800
is making such rapid progress.

283
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm sure you can do it too.

284
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
I may not be as brilliant

285
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
as Ling Dong,

286
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,720
but I can

287
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,640
keep up and get closer,

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,520
little by little.

289
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
I trust you.

290
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,280
Back to work.

291
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
Coffee time.

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
There's plenty for all.

293
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,160
Last mini-test

294
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
before the final.

295
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,360
Got any toughies?

296
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,000
Feel free to ask me after class.

297
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,440
Tomorrow's the big day,

298
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,160
so keep your confidence up

299
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,480
and bring your A-game.

300
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,080
Time to unleash

301
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,320
my inner beast.

302
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,760
Results are in!

303
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,640
The grades are out!

304
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,520
How did we do?

305
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,720
Did you check for us?

306
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,640
Of course.

307
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,400
Ling Dong is the champ.

308
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,480
Cut the crap,

309
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,320
give me the real deal.

310
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,680
Xiaohua did really well this time.

311
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
Significant progress!

312
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,080
Really?

313
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,960
Awesome!

314
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:32,800
Oh no,

315
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,440
Jinghui's been

316
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,280
trailing behind Xiaohua,

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,680
Is he screwed?

318
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,720
You jumped 198 places.

319
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,480
No way.

320
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,960
Ling Dong. How do you know?

321
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
Ash Lan really shot up

322
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,760
by 198!

323
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,320
For real?

324
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,000
For real?

325
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,800
Seriously?

326
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,200
198?

327
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,280
What? Why?

328
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Give me...

329
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,520
a reason!

330
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
What? Why?

331
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,400
He is honest with you.

332
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
Ling Dong did the rankings.

333
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,200
C'mon!

334
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,240
How calm you are!

335
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,600
More fun when it's a secret.

336
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,120
Almost had a heart attack there.

337
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,920
Guys,

338
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,400
don't get

339
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
too carried away.

340
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,040
This time...

341
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,680
we beat Class 8

342
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,320
and became No. 1

343
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,960
in our grade for the finals!

344
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,240
Okay. Stop.

345
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,160
Class begins.

346
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,000
Stand up.

347
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,640
Good morning, ma'am.

348
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,960
Good morning.

349
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,000
Sit down please.

350
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,320
Thank you.

351
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Ling... Dong?

352
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,040
It's nothing.

353
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,680
I admit,

354
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,440
I was wrong.

355
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,240
We all have unlimited potential,

356
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
Do not judge anyone

357
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
based on stereotypes.

358
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,720
But

359
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,240
what I said

360
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,000
still stands.

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,240
He did make

362
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
significant progress this time,

363
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,000
but can you guarantee

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,240
that he'll never affect your grades?

365
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,080
I can't.

366
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,560
But why do you

367
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,520
care so much?

368
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:38,840
You know...

369
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,720
it's good for me actually.

370
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,600
Like you said.

371
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,840
We all have unlimited potential.

372
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,160
I'm gonna keep pushing,

373
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,040
and one day,

374
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,200
I'll be the one on top.

375
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,440
Just wait and see.

376
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,120
Okay.

377
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,840
I will.

378
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,240
Winter break

379
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,720
starts tomorrow.

380
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,200
But all of you

381
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,880
must

382
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,040
complete

383
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,080
your homework well!

384
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,840
No slacking off.

385
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,200
Lastly,

386
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
let's go over

387
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,200
the holiday dos and don'ts.

388
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,840
Alright, stop.

389
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,400
Let's call it a day!

390
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,120
See you next semester.

391
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,120
Bye. See you.

392
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
Gotta wash this mop.

393
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,560
Qingtian.

394
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
You did quite well on your

395
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,320
final exam.

396
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Thanks to your help.

397
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,600
Otherwise,

398
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,680
I wouldn't have done so well.

399
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,320
How can I thank you for this?

400
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,880
Easy,

401
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
just treat me to a meal.

402
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,320
Sure.

403
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
What do you want to eat?

404
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,840
I've been

405
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,960
studying so hard lately,

406
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
I need a good meal.

407
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,200
Great!

408
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,840
Let's go to

409
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,160
the new BBQ restaurant.

410
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm so much looking forward to it.

411
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,000
Good idea!

412
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,920
Twenty.

413
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
Uncle Wang has more.

414
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,880
They are so cute.

415
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
Look at this polar bear

416
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,200
and the penguin...

417
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,680
I like that deer.

418
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,000
I like the polar bear.

419
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,480
This one looks like you, Ma Yiming.

420
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,440
That one looks like you,

421
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,920
see?

422
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,680
Skiing, huh?

423
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
What's wrong? You don't know how?

424
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,840
No such thing!

425
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm a jack of all trades,

426
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,360
of course I can ski.

427
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Come on, let's get our gear.

428
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,160
I'll show you how good I am.

429
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,360
Let's go.

430
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,800
What are you doing?

431
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,920
Aren't you taking photos?

432
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,640
We only have ten pieces of film.

433
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,840
I don't even want her to waste them on me.

434
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,360
Then do it now.

435
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,120
Come on!

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,480
I only have 9 pieces now.

437
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,000
Don't worry,

438
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,840
seize the moment.

439
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
Aim at Ling Dong and snap a photo.

440
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,400
Let's go.

441
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,480
Xiaohua,

442
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,920
your shoelace is loose.

443
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,040
Let me help you.

444
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
Be careful.

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Ling Dong,

446
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,560
you haven't even tied yours properly.

447
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,320
Why are you helping her?

448
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,880
She's my apprentice.

449
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,520
Leave it to me.

450
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,000
Do you know how to do it?

451
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,480
Come on, take a break.

452
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,360
I can do it myself.

453
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,840
Sit down.

454
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,520
No need.

455
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,640
My shoelaces...

456
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,040
are loose.

457
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,680
Get away.

458
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,520
Get away.

459
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,240
- Go away. - Go away.

460
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,360
- Go away. - Go away.

461
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,840
Why aren't you going away?

462
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
Why should I go away?

463
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
- Go away! - Why don't you go away?

464
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,480
Look at your big teeth.

465
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,920
Jinghui, I'll go first.

466
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,080
Ma Yiming.

467
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm leaving.

468
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,160
Wait for me.

469
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,920
Can you two

470
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,520
make it?

471
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,280
Of course, I can.

472
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Lower your body.

473
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Squat a little more.

474
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,120
Hey,

475
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,160
why are you so clumsy?

476
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,840
That's more like it.

477
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,720
Do you know how to ski?

478
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,880
Mind your own business.

479
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,160
Anyway, I'm better than you.

480
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,360
You two wait here.

481
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,480
Please hold this for me.

482
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,880
I'll be back soon.

483
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,640
Here.

484
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,040
This doesn't suit

485
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
my style at all.

486
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,720
Take it.

487
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
It looks just like you.

488
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,120
Thanks.

489
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,320
I just saw that everyone else has one.

490
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,960
You should have one too.

491
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,720
Put it on.

492
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,520
Let's go.

493
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,440
Lan Jinghui, get dressed now!

494
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,920
Are you ready, big potato?

495
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,640
Not yet.

496
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,400
Ready!

497
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,480
Remember

498
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,760
to lower

499
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,680
your center of gravity.

500
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,520
Got it.

501
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,120
I'll go first.

502
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,280
Are you really going down?

503
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,480
Xiaohua,

504
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,840
are you scared?

505
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,680
I... Yes, I am.

506
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Master, how about you?

507
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,920
I'm scared too.

508
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,720
Ling Dong! Lan Jinghui is frightened!

509
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,040
No way!

510
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,280
I'm a jack of all trades!

511
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,880
Is it fun?

512
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,880
So much!

513
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,400
Xiaohua.

514
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,360
I wanna go one more round.

515
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,320
Let's go.

516
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,360
Ma Yiming, you...

517
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,880
Why is it Ma Yiming again?

518
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,720
Watch the center of gravity.

519
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,000
Lower the center of gravity.

520
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
Get out of the way.

521
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,480
Lan Jinghui.

522
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,040
Lan Jinghui.

523
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,840
Are you okay?

524
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,080
Are you okay?

525
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,560
My back...

526
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,480
What's wrong?

527
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,080
What happened?

528
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,840
Does it hurt?

529
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,160
Speak slowly.

530
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,720
Take it easy.

531
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,200
It hurts here.

532
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,480
It hurts right here.

533
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,360
What's wrong?

534
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,840
Does it hurt here?

535
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,960
It's like...

536
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,160
Look...

537
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,280
What's...

538
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,480
Lan Jinghui!

539
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,440
Ma Yiming!

540
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,200
Lan Jinghui!

541
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,400
Ma Yiming!

542
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,640
Oh, I'm so sorry!

543
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,040
Ms. Fang?

544
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,960
Qingtian?

545
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,200
Why are you here?

546
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,040
Hi, Ms. Fang.

547
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,040
Hello.

548
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
You guys came skiing too?

549
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,360
Yes, we two

550
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,880
and Lan Jinghui,

551
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,040
Ling Dong, and Xiao Xiaohua,

552
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,920
came together.

553
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Where are

554
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,040
the other three?

555
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,280
They are playing over there.

556
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,760
How's your skiing?

557
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,560
Good.

558
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,320
Not bad.

559
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,920
Ms. Fang,

560
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,240
is this your boyfriend?

561
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
Boyfriend?

562
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,680
No, this is...

563
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,360
A friend.

564
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,800
We won't bother you then.

565
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,560
Alright.

566
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,440
We'll go have fun now.

567
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,120
- Okay. - Okay.

568
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,240
We're leaving. Bye.

569
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,800
Bye.

570
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
Take care and have fun.

571
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Let's go, my friend.

572
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,120
Goodbye.

573
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,120
Bye.

574
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:15,880
What happened?

575
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,600
Take off your glasses.

576
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,560
It's inconvenient.

577
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,400
Why do you say so?

578
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,200
Ma Yiming!

579
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Ma Yiming!

580
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
Chen Luyang? What a coincidence!

581
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,520
I come to ski.

582
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,640
You just got here?

583
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,000
It's so nice to meet you here.

584
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,680
Can you ski?

585
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:39,960
Not really.

586
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,600
Come on, I'll teach you!

587
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Thank you for what you've done in school.

588
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,240
Sounds cool.

589
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,160
Let's go.

590
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,560
Go.

591
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,960
Ling Dong,

592
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,960
Lan Jinghui,

593
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,560
let's take a picture together.

594
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:57,920
Sure.

595
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:58,720
Jinghui,

596
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,880
I just saw Ms. Fang

597
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,720
and her boyfriend.

598
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,840
Wait a bit,

599
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,360
they might come over soon.

600
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,400
Why are you so nosy?

601
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,160
Leave them alone.

602
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,560
I just happened to run into them,

603
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,000
alright?

604
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,840
I didn't mean to...

605
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,760
Hi, Ms. Fang.

606
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Hi, Ms. Fang.

607
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,000
How many times are you guys

608
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,560
going to pull this prank?

609
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,280
Don't act like three idiots,

610
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,840
okay?

611
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,560
Hello, idiot.

612
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,400
Hi.

613
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,280
Hello, Ms. Fang.

614
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,720
Where's your boyfriend?

615
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,520
What boyfriend?

616
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,240
It's not easy to get a break.

617
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,520
Then, I still run into you guys.

618
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,200
He's...

619
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,800
just a friend.

620
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,400
Just a friend!

621
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:47,920
Alright, stop!

622
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,800
Are you

623
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,960
gonna take a picture?

624
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeah.

625
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,840
I'll do it for you.

626
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,280
Thank you.

627
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,240
Alright, I'll give you

628
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,160
a countdown.

629
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,760
Okay.

630
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,280
Here we go.

631
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,000
3, 2, 1!

632
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,240
Cheese.

633
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,120
Perfect.

634
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,120
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

635
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
Thank you so much.

636
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,960
Crispy outside,

637
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,000
and juicy inside.

638
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,600
It's the grilled sausage I like.

639
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,600
Glad you like it.

640
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,480
Xiaohua!

641
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,080
Chen Luyang?

642
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,720
- Why are you here? - Why are you here?

643
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,320
The ski resort

644
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,560
isn't owned by your family.

645
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,720
Why can't I be here?

646
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,000
It's really great to have so many here!

647
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,960
We can have a meal together later.

648
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,320
Sure.

649
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm starving.

650
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,440
Let's

651
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,320
go to Mr. Lan's place.

652
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,120
Wait.

653
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,920
Mr. Lan?

654
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,080
Well...

655
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Ma Yiming is saying that...

656
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,240
Actually, the thing is...

657
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Does that man look like

658
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,400
your dad?

659
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,800
C'mon,

660
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,000
he is!

661
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,440
It's pretty cold here.

662
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,960
Yeah.

663
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,200
My boy, do you feel cold?

664
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,360
Have fun?

665
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,440
You must be tired.

666
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
I reserved a table

667
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
at the restaurant nearby.

668
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,080
Let's go eat!

669
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,640
That's cool!

670
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
We're starving!

671
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Let's eat together.

672
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,160
Come on, dinner time.

673
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:39,880
Let's go.

674
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,880
Let's change clothes first.

675
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,520
Time to eat.

676
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,720
Don't just sit there.

677
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,280
Just do it.

678
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,320
The food will get cold soon.

679
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,440
Make yourself at home.

680
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,040
Do it!

681
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,680
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

682
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,480
You're welcome.

683
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,240
If you want anything else,

684
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,560
just

685
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,720
let me know.

686
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
Just tell him what you want, okay?

687
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,240
You are

688
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,920
Jinghui's best friends.

689
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm sure

690
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,000
he's troubled you often.

691
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,760
I appreciate

692
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,760
your kindness.

693
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,200
Cheers!

694
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,640
Cheers.

695
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,440
Cheers.

696
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,760
Ling Dong,

697
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,920
I especially wanna thank you

698
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,280
for helping Jinghui

699
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,560
achieve good grades.

700
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,880
I'm flattered.

701
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,520
He worked hard himself.

702
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,440
I didn't do much.

703
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,920
Alright, stop chatting.

704
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,600
It's dinner time.

705
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,200
Right, do it.

706
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,160
By the way,

707
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,880
I have a question for you.

708
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,320
Since you're gonna in Grade 12,

709
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,200
what are your plans

710
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,360
for the future?

711
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,760
Play professional basketball.

712
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,480
Amazing.

713
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,360
I want to be a food blogger

714
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
and try all kinds of food.

715
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,520
That's great.

716
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,560
To be admitted by the Department

717
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
of Computer Science at Jing University.

718
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,240
That's tough, and you might go bald.

719
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,800
Really?

720
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,280
Should I change a major then?

721
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,080
You'll have to wear a wig in the future.

722
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,800
Ling Dong,

723
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,600
is your goal

724
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
also Jing University?

725
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
But I'm fond of physics.

726
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,320
Physics?

727
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,360
I heard it demands a pretty high score.

728
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,160
Go for it!

729
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,840
Thank you.

730
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,120
I envy you guys with good grades.

731
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,360
You can choose whatever you want.

732
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,000
What about you, Xiaohua?

733
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,960
I...

734
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,240
haven't decided yet.

735
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,520
I don't think Jinghui has decided.

736
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,560
But no worries,

737
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,640
I've arranged everything

738
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,800
for you to study abroad.

739
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,600
That's a really good university.

740
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
Besides,

741
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,960
an IELTS tutor

742
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,640
is also prepared.

743
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,680
You could use the winter break

744
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
to improve your English

745
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,640
and prepare for

746
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,760
studying abroad next semester.

747
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,760
Dad,

748
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,200
you've got it all set up?

749
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,000
Why didn't you

750
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
ask for my opinion?

751
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:55,800
Well...

752
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,240
haven't I ever

753
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,320
listened to your opinion?

754
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,160
See,

755
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,720
I transferred you to Chenjun

756
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,680
as you wish,

757
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,080
but you didn't make a name for yourself

758
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,840
in basketball.

759
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,840
Now,

760
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,280
studying abroad

761
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
is the best choice for you.

762
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,920
But I don't want it.

763
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,800
Then,

764
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,040
what do you want to do?

765
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,240
I...

766
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm aiming at Jing University, too!

767
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,960
When Lan Jinghui said

768
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
he wanna go to Jing University,

769
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,280
we're all surprised.

770
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,440
We didn't know if he just said it on a whim

771
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,960
or had long planned it.

772
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,920
Perhaps it was a dream

773
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,760
he buried deep in his heart

774
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,160
but never had the courage

775
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,760
to say out loud.

776
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,200
Hello.

777
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm here already.

778
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:00,760
Yeah.

779
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,360
I don't see any of you.

780
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,120

Hello?

782
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,040
Hello?

783
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,680
Where am I going to be taken?

784
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,280
Shut up,

785
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,960
you'll know it later.

786
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,240
This is kidnapping!

787
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,840
Skiing, huh?
