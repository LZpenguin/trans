Bright Time EP14

3
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,320
Go, go!

4
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,640
Come on!

5
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Great job, Lan Jinghui!

6
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,600
Take it easy, don't rush!

7
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,800
Keep going!

8
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,920
Lan Jinghui, keep it up!

9
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,680
Keep going!

10
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,840
Lan Jinghui, go!

11
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Lan Jinghui!

12
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
Come on!

13
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
Great job, everyone.

14
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,520
It's okay.

15
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,640
We're not far behind

16
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,320
Class 1,

17
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,520
so let's

18
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
keep pushing.

19
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,240
Good effort, everyone.

20
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,720
Wu Ge.

21
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,000
How's it going?

22
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Not bad.

23
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,880
Number 10 is playing well.

24
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,200
All right, listen up.

25
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,280
Gather around.

26
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,960
We did well in the first half,

27
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,160
just a few points behind.

28
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,840
No worries.

29
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,240
In the second half,

30
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
we need to closely mark

31
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,560
number 35 and 28.

32
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,320
One is strong, and the other

33
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,000
can shoot threes.

34
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Ma Yiming,

35
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,440
in the second half,

36
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
we'll support you with fast breaks.

37
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
Got it?

38
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,160
Jian Zhiqiang...

39
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,080
All right,

40
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
you go ahead.

41
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,840
Let's talk after the game.

42
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,240
Hey,

43
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,960
who's that over there?

44
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,640
An old friend,

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
just catching up.

46
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,680
Great effort.

47
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,160
Keep it up!

48
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,360
Class 5 will win! We will win!

49
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,280
Go, go!

50
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,480
Go, go!

51
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,440
The other team is bigger.

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,880
Be careful and don't go head-to-head.

53
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Don't worry,

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,160
I got this.

55
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,920
Lan Jinghui, go!

56
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
Go, go!

57
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,840
Go, go!

58
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,080
What's wrong?

59
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,840
What happened?

60
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,880
Move, move!

61
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
Give him some air!

62
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Are you okay?

63
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Glasses broken, I can't see clearly.

64
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,960
What do we do?

65
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
We don't have a substitute.

66
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,880
This is unfortunate.

67
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,840
This guy is really causing trouble.

68
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,520
Lan Jinghui.

69
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Lan Jinghui.

70
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
If it doesn't work,

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,320
should we forfeit?

72
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,960
No way,

73
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,760
we can't forfeit.

74
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,920
It's okay, I can still...

75
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Are you sure?

76
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
Don't push yourself.

77
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,000
How are you feeling now?

78
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Without a substitute,

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
do we have

80
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
to forfeit?

81
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,840
No, we'll switch players.

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,160
Switch players?

83
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,680
Rest for a bit

84
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,960
and find some glasses.

85
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,040
I'll play.

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Ling Dong can play basketball?

87
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,120
Did I see that right?

88
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,280
He can play?

89
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,800
I've never seen him on the court before.

90
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,360
Could he be

91
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,080
our secret weapon?

92
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,160
Can Ling Dong do it?

93
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I don't know.

94
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,120
People who step up in these situations

95
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,040
are either game-changers

96
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,200
or complete rookies.

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Violation.

98
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,360
Rebound!

99
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,160
Move!

100
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,880
Nice shot!

101
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,960
Double dribble.

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,560
Kicking the ball.

103
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,760
Violation.

104
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,400
Traveling.

105
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,880
What are you doing?

106
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,960
Can you even

107
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,440
play basketball?

108
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,920
Go! Go! Go!

109
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,880
Come on!

110
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,360
Defense! Defense!

111
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,640
Go! Go! Go!

112
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,720
Hurry, defense!

113
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,800
Go! Go!

114
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,680
Go! Go!

115
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,280
Go! Go!

116
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,560
Go, Class 5! Go, Class 5!

117
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,080
Come on!

118
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Go, Class 5!

119
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Go!

120
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:56,200
Go, go!

121
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,720
Go, Class 5! Go, Class 5!

122
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Go, Class 5! Go, Class 5!

123
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,680
Go, Class 5!

124
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Lan Jinghui, congrats!

125
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,680
You guys were awesome!

126
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,480
Absolutely amazing!

127
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,200
It's okay.

128
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,600
Let's talk later. Let's go.

129
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Mengyu, how was I just now?

130
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,760
Not bad.

131
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,880
You guys were so cool

132
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
out there!

133
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,760
Yeah,

134
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,600
especially that shot you made,

135
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,560
and Ling Dong's

136
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,800
final three-pointer, it was awesome!

137
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,640
Keep the compliments coming!

138
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,440
But actually,

139
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
that was only fifty percent

140
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,280
of my skill.

141
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
I haven't

142
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,640
shown my full...

143
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,720
Hey! That's my water.

144
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,560
You've really changed.

145
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
What's the big deal?

146
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,760
Thanks for your hard work today.

147
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,800
Just doing our part.

148
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,760
Great.

149
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,880
Next,

150
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,200
keep up the effort.

151
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,680
Oh, come on.

152
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,600
Why is he so annoying?

153
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,120
Struggled just to play against Class 1?

154
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,240
No wonder you're a bottom-tier team,

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,280
bringing in random people to play.

156
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,640
How do you know

157
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,880
he's random?

158
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,320
Maybe he's

159
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
our secret weapon.

160
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:11,760
Fine,

161
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,200
see you in the finals.

162
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
We will easily win the championship.

163
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,520
Don't you know

164
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,000
villains always lose because

165
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,320
they talk too much?

166
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,720
Who are you calling a villain?

167
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Lan Jinghui.

168
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,080
Go do your thing.

169
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,400
We'll see.

170
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't you think

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,080
you owe me an explanation?

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,560
What explanation?

173
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you actually know

174
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,320
how to play basketball?

175
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,640
No.

176
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,680
So

177
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,960
you might

178
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,240
be a

179
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,040
once-in-a-hundred-years genius,

180
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,000
though

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
a bit behind me,

182
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
who's a once-in-a-millennium talent.

183
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I told you,

184
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,320
there's no

185
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,480
downside to joining,

186
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,960
am I right?

187
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
Listen to me,

188
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,440
basketball is great

189
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,760
when you're tired of studying,

190
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,320
you know?

191
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
It helps build your core muscles,

192
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,360
improves coordination,

193
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,880
and has countless benefits.

194
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,760
Trust me, it's something

195
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,880
that benefits you for lifetime.

196
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,520
get you.

198
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,920
You need to strike a balance

199
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,280
among physical education, arts, and labor.

200
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you understand me?

201
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,120
You don't have the energy

202
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,240
someone at your age should have.

203
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,440
Wait, why don't you

204
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,520
listen to me?

205
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,760
Besides,

206
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
the most important thing

207
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,320
about basketball

208
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,520
is improving your body coordination.

209
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,840
Look at me, I'm agile

210
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,760
and I don't

211
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,560
bump into them.

212
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,000
Are you listening?

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,520
Hey!

214
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,920
Listen,

215
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,760
you can walk slower.

216
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,720
I'm holding food.

217
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
But I've been telling you

218
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,040
about basketball

219
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,400
until my mouth is dry.

220
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,080
You won't

221
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,520
understand its charm

222
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,680
unless you play it yourself.

223
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,280
This sport

224
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,040
is so great.

225
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,880
It's competitive and demanding.

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Only basketball

227
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,240
can bring

228
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,880
a team together,

229
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,240
do you get it?

230
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
I've never seen you this hungry.

231
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,440
See?

232
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,400
No one who doesn't

233
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,520
play basketball has this kind of energy.

234
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,920
But seriously,

235
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,760
the charm

236
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,720
of basketball

237
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,280
is that...

238
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Ling Dong, Ling Dong!

239
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,920
How long are you going to follow me?

240
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,280
Until you join

241
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
our basketball team.

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,480
Why do you

243
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,880
want me to join so badly?

244
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,600
I don't care.

245
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,120
You stole

246
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,760
my thunder that day,

247
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,280
and I've already announced you

248
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,960
as our secret weapon.

249
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
You have to join our team.

250
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,760
Then come with me.

251
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,720
Sure.

252
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,320
Wait,

253
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,640
are you agreeing?

254
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,480
Is that what this means?

255
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,640
Why did you bring me here?

256
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,120
Give me the ball.

257
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,120
The ball.

258
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,240
Your shooting accuracy

259
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,080
is impressive.

260
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,200
It's a shame if you don't

261
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,920
join the team.

262
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,000
But my dad only taught me how to shoot.

263
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,640
Dad, you're amazing!

264
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,400
I want to learn to shoot too.

265
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,920
You want to learn?

266
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,280
Then Dad will teach you now, okay?

267
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,960
When you grow up,

268
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,720
Dad will teach you how to shoot, layup,

269
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,640
dunk, and dribble.

270
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,120
Ready, aim,

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
shoot!

272
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,280
Ling Dong scores!

273
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,800
The most crucial point,

274
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,920
Ling Dong wins!

275
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,400
When I was little,

276
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,760
my dad used to

277
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,640
bring me to this court.

278
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,360
Then...

279
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,280
why did you stop?

280
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,800
I didn't get the chance.

281
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,480
He passed away.

282
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,160
I'm...

283
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,120
sorry.

284
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,600
I didn't know,

285
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,640
I hadn't heard.

286
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,480
I'm really sorry.

287
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
So every time I miss him,

288
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,840
I come to this court.

289
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,760
He taught me how to shoot.

290
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,360
So you only know how to shoot,

291
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,400
nothing else?

292
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Dad, when can I shoot

293
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
at that big hoop?

294
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,280
When you

295
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,400
grow as tall

296
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,360
as Dad,

297
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,600
you can shoot at the big hoop.

298
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,080
Then show me first.

299
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,640
All right, Dad will show you.

300
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,600
In that case,

301
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
we're actually quite similar.

302
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,160
I saw your dad, that day.

303
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
That's not what I meant.

304
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,280
I started

305
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,400
playing basketball

306
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
because of my dad too.

307
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,440
He came to see me in Singapore

308
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,760
for the first time, and I happened

309
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
to be playing in a championship game.

310
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,040
I won the championship,

311
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,480
and since then,

312
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,440
I thought

313
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,320
he liked me and paid attention to me

314
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,840
because I played basketball.

315
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,640
So

316
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,800
I kept playing every day

317
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,360
and gradually developed a habit.

318
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,280
Out of 365 days a year,

319
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
you're home

320
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,480
so little I can count

321
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,400
on my fingers!

322
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,720
I can't live

323
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,520
like this anymore!

324
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:05,960
No!

325
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm doing this

326
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,000
to earn money for us!

327
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,160
Stop talking about money!

328
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,680
Okay?

329
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,160
It never ends!

330
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,840
I just want you home

331
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,880
with me and our son.

332
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
Is that too much?

333
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,000
You're not a good father,

334
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,520
let alone a good husband.

335
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,600
And...

336
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm taking our child.

337
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm telling you, Yu Lihua,

338
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,080
don't even think about it!

339
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,080
He's my son.

340
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,240
No way I'm letting you

341
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,920
take him!

342
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
If you want to leave, go alone!

343
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,960
He's my son too!

344
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,160
I'm taking him!

345
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
He's my own flesh and blood!

346
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,840
I...

347
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,160
So your mom took you abroad?

348
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,200
And then?

349
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,560
Ling Dong,

350
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,800
are we here

351
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,840
for stories?

352
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,080
Isn't this

353
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,960
why we're here?

354
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,280
Didn't you say

355
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,320
no one

356
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,480
taught you after that?

357
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,480
I'll teach you.

358
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
You're pretty talented,

359
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,640
learning quickly.

360
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm a fast learner.

361
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,120
Why not

362
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,400
stop studying so hard

363
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,920
and play

364
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,720
basketball with me?

365
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,320
We could achieve greatness together.

366
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,920
What do you think?

367
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,960
I have my own goals.

368
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
All right, tell me.

369
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
What do you want to do?

370
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Study physics at Jing University.

371
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,440
Jing University?

372
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,720
The one in the Jing City?

373
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,880
What else?

374
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,000
Sometimes

375
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,280
I don't get

376
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
why you top students

377
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,680
always pick

378
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,640
the hardest paths.

379
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,560
Isn't it better to

380
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,080
live happily?

381
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
But dreams are important.

382
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,440
What if you achieve them,

383
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,240
right?

384
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,760
It's not my dream,

385
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,920
just my

386
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,680
next step.

387
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,080
True,

388
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
you top students

389
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,960
usually achieve what you

390
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,840
set your minds to.

391
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,160
So,

392
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,680
have you rested enough?

393
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,400
If you...

394
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,920
Stop,

395
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,640
isn't it rude

396
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
to complain like that?

397
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I've been seriously

398
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,040
teaching you basketball.

399
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,560
Shouldn't you call me

400
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,320
Coach Lan out of respect?

401
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
Are you going to keep teaching or not?

402
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,280
Your dad taught you

403
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,440
when you were little,

404
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,120
now it's me.

405
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,920
I've roamed the world

406
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
for years,

407
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,200
and maybe I've picked up some

408
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
fatherly wisdom.

409
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,000
How about calling me...

410
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,920
Big Cousin.

411
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,080
Stop messing with family titles.

412
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,280
Come on, Big Cousin.

413
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
It's just our class and Class 8 left.

414
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,680
Rivals meet again.

415
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,880
They are tough.

416
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,880
They have good players

417
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,400
and work well together.

418
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
Plus, there's that tough guy, Bi Peng.

419
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,600
Feels like we can't win.

420
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,040
Why are you scared?

421
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
Don't undermine our morale?

422
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,680
Class 8 isn't that scary.

423
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
I watched them

424
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,080
play against Class 4 yesterday.

425
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,840
Their defense

426
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,720
has gaps.

427
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,280
Since we can't improve

428
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,600
our skills quickly,

429
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,600
let's come up

430
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,520
with a strategy to outsmart them.

431
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,920
Wow,

432
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,080
didn't know

433
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,600
you had a knack for strategy.

434
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,400
How about

435
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,880
spying on their

436
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,560
practice tomorrow?

437
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm not going.

438
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,000
Why not?

439
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Didn't you do great

440
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,960
in the talent show?

441
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,600
Despicable.

442
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,400
Ma Yiming!

443
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,200
If he won't go,

444
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,280
we will.

445
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,280
Is it safe?

446
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Let's go.

447
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,560
Jinghui.

448
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,320
It's fine.

449
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
Jinghui, I've got all the details.

450
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,600
Listen,

451
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,240
Number 13,

452
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,840
the point guard,

453
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,480
is good at passing and ball control.

454
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,640
His speed,

455
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,520
especially on defense,

456
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,360
is impressive.

457
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Leave him to Xu Chao.

458
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:28,880
And

459
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,120
number 9,

460
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,680
the shooting guard,

461
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,480
is a three-point specialist.

462
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,640
He rarely misses

463
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,960
from outside.

464
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,360
No worries,

465
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,920
Ling Dong can handle him.

466
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,000
And then there's Bi Peng.

467
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,360
No need to say more, right?

468
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,160
Old rival.

469
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,360
Jinghui, Bi Peng

470
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,720
will be your responsibility.

471
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,960
Can you handle it?

472
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,400
Yes.

473
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,960
Are you sure?

474
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,120
Trust me.

475
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,760
Jinghui,

476
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
Class 8's average height

477
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
is around 1.9 meters.

478
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,680
What do we do?

479
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,560
We're much shorter.

480
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,880
You two, what are you up to?

481
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,600
Retreat!

482
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,000
Come in.

483
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,680
Mr. Guo.

484
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,920
Ms. Chai.

485
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,800
Ms. Fang.

486
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,640
- Mr. Zhao. - Still working?

487
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,840
Let's grab a meal.

488
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,880
No, thanks.

489
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,640
I don't want people

490
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,760
saying the basketball coach

491
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
is giving special treatment

492
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,400
to our Class 5.

493
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,480
We wouldn't want that.

494
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
Come on, Ms. Fang, it's just a meal.

495
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
Even a meal isn't right.

496
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,240
Plus, my class

497
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
is still practicing.

498
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,560
I need to check on them.

499
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,200
About that hotpot last time...

500
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,120
Excuse me.

501
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,000
Let me, let me.

502
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,040
No need.

503
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,520
Ms. Fang,

504
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:16,920
let me help you.

505
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,160
Go!

506
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,880
Nice shot!

507
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,760
Hey, it's our ball.

508
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,000
Everyone.

509
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,360
Ms. Fang.

510
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800
Take a break, have some water.

511
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,640
Let us help you.

512
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,840
Thanks, teacher.

513
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,680
Thanks a lot.

514
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,040
How's it going, Lan Jinghui?

515
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,240
How's practice?

516
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,440
It's...

517
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,240
okay, I guess.

518
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,160
Just okay?

519
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,920
Yeah, all right.

520
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
And you three, how's it going?

521
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,400
- We're good. - Just okay.

522
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,360
- Mr. Zhao. - Mr. Zhao.

523
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,360
Training, huh?

524
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,640
How's the training going?

525
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,120
The game against Class 8 is coming up.

526
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,120
It's... still the same.

527
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Seeing these

528
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
worried faces

529
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,920
reminds me

530
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,440
of our old basketball days.

531
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,720
You played basketball?

532
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
I know what they're worried about.

533
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,280
What are they worried about?

534
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,880
First, strong scoring ability

535
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,360
and quick breakthroughs.

536
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,760
Who else at our school can do that?

537
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,000
Who?

538
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
Bi Peng from Class 8.

539
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,200
Bi Peng from Class 8, right?

540
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,680
I confronted opponents

541
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,600
like Bi Peng before.

542
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,160
They all have

543
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,800
a fatal flaw.

544
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,240
What flaw?

545
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,520
Their technique is rough,

546
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,400
you know?

547
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,760
They only dribble with their right hand,

548
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,600
so

549
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,240
they're strongest when

550
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,600
breaking through from the right.

551
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
So what did you do?

552
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
When I defended him,

553
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,040
I focused on his right side

554
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,360
and eased up on the left.

555
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,560
Eased up on the left.

556
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,760
Anything else, Mr. Zhao?

557
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,000
Do you have

558
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,240
any other stories

559
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
like that?

560
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,280
And

561
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,160
when he posted up,

562
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,360
our guard

563
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,840
would strip the ball.

564
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,000
I kept his scoring

565
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,120
under ten points that game.

566
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,280
Did your team...

567
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,640
sorry,

568
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,400
I mean, your opponent,

569
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,000
have a

570
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
particularly strong center?

571
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,800
Yes.

572
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,760
How did you handle that?

573
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,400
At that time, their center,

574
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,880
whenever he was on the court,

575
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,240
we couldn't score.

576
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,640
We couldn't even grab a rebound.

577
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,640
So what did you do?

578
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,640
Our coach

579
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,360
was out of ideas,

580
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,240
so he picked the most

581
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,880
physically fit player on our team.

582
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,160
Zhiqiang!

583
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Yes, just like your class's

584
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,120
Jian Zhiqiang.

585
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,640
Right?

586
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,360
He told him,

587
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
just push him out of

588
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,800
the three-second area, no matter what!

589
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,480
Push him out, you know?

590
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,400
Push him out.

591
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,840
Mr. Zhao, any other stories?

592
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,720
Yeah, any more?

593
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,440
Yeah!

594
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,600
We want to hear more.

595
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:54,840
Mr. Zhao,

596
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,160
please share with us.

597
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,160
Sure, but my throat is getting dry.

598
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,560
I got it, I got it.

599
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,440
Here, Mr. Zhao,

600
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,040
have some water.

601
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,920
Drink it.

602
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,640
Any other stories?

603
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,880
Back to the center.

604
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,960
That center had good skills,

605
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
height,

606
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,400
and scoring ability.

607
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,760
But he had one fatal flaw.

608
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
What flaw?

609
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
A bad temper.

610
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,800
A bad temper.

611
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,160
When he got mad,

612
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,240
he made more mistakes.

613
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,480
More mistakes,

614
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,480
more fouls.

615
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,920
Mr. Zhao,

616
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,200
did your opponents ever have

617
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,360
a shooter who never missed?

618
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:32,840
Yes.

619
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,960
We played against the top-ranked team

620
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,480
in the province,

621
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,320
and their shooting guard

622
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,400
was deadly.

623
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Don't give him an open shot.

624
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,000
He'd hit every time.

625
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,840
So what did you do?

626
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,000
Well...

627
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,080
I can't really tell you.

628
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,640
Why not?

629
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,960
You can tell us, Mr. Zhao.

630
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,560
What's there to hide? Tell us.

631
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,200
Sure it's not...

632
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,720
Mr. Zhao, it's fine.

633
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,080
You can tell me.

634
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,120
What did you do?

635
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,680
I want to know.

636
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,480
How did you handle him?

637
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,920
Simple,

638
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,960
just block his view.

639
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And if they don't let you block?

640
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
If they don't let you block, just...

641
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,320
If they don't let you block,

642
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,840
can I poke him

643
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,680
like this?

644
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,600
No,

645
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,200
you can't do that.

646
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,640
It's against sportsmanship.

647
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,120
Just block him naturally.
