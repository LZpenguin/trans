Go back home with me!

Meng'an, wait!

00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:53,480
Come with me!

Let's go home!

00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:54,879
Meng'an, you...

15
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,960
Come home with me.

16
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,599
Hey, listen to me.

00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,999
Just come home.

Please hear me out.

19
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,360
You're a tech guy.

20
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,680
You're supposed to do research.

21
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:05,680
This kind of work will wear you down.

22

I'm fine.

Please, come home.

27
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,719
I'm really not going back.

28
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,719
Let's go. Come with me.

29
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,279
I'm fine, really. I swear.

30
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,240
Seriously, Meng'an.

31
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:16,999

35
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,759
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,999
I'm truly sorry, Meng'an, I...

37
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,559
I've let you down again.

38
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,840
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

39
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,439
But I still want to try.

40
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,280

41
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,079
I still want to

work hard to make you

feel safe

44
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
and give you a better life.

45
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,079
I can't

46
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,840
put all the weight on your shoulders.

47

You've got me too.

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,559
Just give me another chance.

49
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,399

50

I know, I know.

Please, just listen.

52
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,240
This is the hardest time

of my life.

54
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,480
But I won't give up.

55
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
I won't quit.

57
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,360
try my best

59

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,120
and a loving dad.

61
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,480
Just give me some time.

62
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,399
Please.

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,199
I need a little more time.

Do you remember me?

71
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,800
Xu Meng'an?

72
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,199
It's been a while.

73
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
Last time I was back from abroad,

74
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,800
I saw Li Lin.

75
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,199
We even talked about you.

76
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
Thanks.

77
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,879
Yeah, well,

78
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,160
I need to

79
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,959
[ask you a favor.]

80
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,240
What is it?

81
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Li Lin

82
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,959
lost his job.

83
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
What?

84
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
How?

85
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,360
It was pretty sudden.

86
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,720
When he went to Beijing

87
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,040
to visit you last time,

88
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,559
he might've been hoping you could help.

89
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,879
But,

90
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,079
maybe because you're an old classmate,

91
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,680
he couldn't bring himself to ask.

92
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,519
So I mean,

93
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm asking now

94
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
for him

95
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,480
is there any job

96
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,920
that might suit him.

97
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,399
No wonder when we

98
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:43,999
met last time,

99
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,759
he seemed a bit off.

100
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
[It was like he was trying to hint]

101
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,440
[that he wanted]

102
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
[to make a career change.]

103
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:51,999
I even advised him

104
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,919
to wait for the right moment.

105
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,039
If that's the case,

106
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,879
finding a job

107
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
is pretty urgent now.

108
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah.

109
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,360
I, I am hoping

110
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,999
maybe in your field

111
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,560
there is something he could do

112
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,039
or someone you could refer him to.

113
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,080
If not,

114
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,240
anything else would help.

115
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,679
Well, I just...

116
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,480
I really don't know who else to turn to.

117
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:25,639
So I thought

118
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,999
you might help him out.

119
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,159
Don't worry.

120
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,399
I'd totally help you.

121
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,679
Thanks a lot.

122
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,480
Can you keep it between us

123
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,999
that I called?

124
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,960
Sure.

125
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,560
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

126
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,399
You're up.

127
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,399
What are you doing here?

128
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,240
I was craving your wontons.

129
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,679
I'll make some for you.

130
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:35,279
Why do Xin and I

131
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,960
always have one egg

132
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,360
in our wontons

133
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,759
but Mom gets two?

134
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,560
Because your mom bore me two daughters.

135
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:25,879
I'm good now.

136
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,639
Then you should head back.

137
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,519
You still need to

138
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,960
get Yunjie to school later.

139
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,560
And your mom's gonna wake up.

140
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,639
Go on.

141
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
Director Xu,

142
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,879
the bidding's about to start.

143
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,879
We need to go now.

144
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,560
We're gonna win, right?

145
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,759
We've worked so hard.

146
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,120
Hard work doesn't always

147
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,759
guarantee success.

148
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,600
People say

149
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,159
if you don't try, you'll never succeed.

150
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,639
My mom always told me to

151
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,279
never pass up a chance

152
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,759
to give it my all.

153
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,560
But I still want to try.

154
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,440
I,

155
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
I still want to

156
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,960
work hard to make you

157
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:09,999
feel safe

158
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,200
and give you a better life.

159
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,519
[I can't]

160
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
[put all the weight on your shoulders.]

161
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,120
Let's go.

162
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,320
Mr. Yu,

163
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,120
you're really dedicated.

164
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,200
Showing up for the bidding yourself.

165
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,120
You guys go on ahead and get ready.

166
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,960
Wait, wait.

167
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:36,600
I

168
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,480
need to tell you something.

169
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,480
You two go in first.

170
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,039
What's the matter?

171
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,320
[What's really going on?]

172
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
[Why so hesitant?]

173
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,600
You're wearing the ring.

174
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,320
[Glad that you took my advice.]

175
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,600
Good for you.

176
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,039
Yeah, I'm wearing it,

177
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:09,879
but Wanzhen still

178
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,960
wants a divorce.

179
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,480
If she said that,

180
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,879
she is serious about it.

181
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,480
The paperwork's already started.

182
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,560
But I don't want a divorce.

183
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,919
Why didn't you realize that sooner?

184
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,440
I know, I messed up.

185
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,399
I messed up everything.

186
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,759
Can you talk to her?

187
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,399
No way.

188
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,879
You two are best friends, aren't you?

189
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,440
Yeah,

190
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,480
we are.

191
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,200
But we're also

192
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,120
mature, independent women

193
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,600
and take responsibility for our choices.

194
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,999
We're not going to change

195
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,200
major life choices

196
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,600
just because someone says so.

197
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,639
Wanzhen means what she says.

198
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm sure she gave you chances,

199
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,639
but you didn't take them.

200
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,759
I'm heading in now.

201
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,999
Yes, this is Huaxing Real Estate.

202
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:14,919
Wanzhen,

203
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,600
don't forget to bring the materials

204
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
to the meeting room at 2 p.m.

205
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,479
Got it.

206
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,040
Thank you.

207
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,520
Don't mention it.

208
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,399
Wanzhen,

209
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,919
where should I put these boxes?

210
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,000
Just set them on the table.

211
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,199
I'll handle it.

212
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,719
Madam,

213
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,919
where should I put this bottled water?

214
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,159
Follow me.

215
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:34,959
Okay.

216
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,280
[Wanzhen.]

217
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:39,040
Put it in the beverage bar over there.

218
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,360
Okay.

219
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,239
Here's a document.

220
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,080
I need ten copies of it.

221
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,719
Meng'an,

222
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,679
what brings you here?

223
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,959
Why didn't you tell me

224
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,239
something this big happened?

225
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,800
I just started this new job,

226
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,879
and I've been swamped.

227
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:19,879
No time to catch up.

228
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,639
I thought I should

229
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,040
tell you this in person.

230
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
So you really wanna divorce him?

231
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,280
You heard it from Yu Hai?

232
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
I ran into him

233
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
at the bidding today.

234
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,959
He said he doesn't want the divorce

235
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,879
and asked me to talk to you.

236
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,840
I refused, though.

237
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,000
You know me so well.

238
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,760
Have you

239
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:42,639
made up your mind?

240
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,479
If you were in my shoes,

241
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,840
you'd make the same choice, right?

242
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,040
Probably.

243
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,280
In your marriage,

244
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,199
Yu Hai was the one who messed up.

245
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,320
He should face the consequences.

246
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,439
I've got your back.

247
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,679
Just tell me if you need anything.

248
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:02,679
I'm moving out the day after tomorrow.

249
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,080
Are you going with me?

250
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:04,840
Where are you moving?

251
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
To an apartment downtown.

252
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,840
It's not far from here.

253
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:07,800
I've already packed up.

254
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,479
So, will you come?

255
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,520
Of course.

256
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,479
That's great.

257
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,679
Seeing you doing well,

258
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,879
I'm relieved.

259
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Is the Wendy Chen excelling

260
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,360
in the finance world making a comeback?

261
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,679
[Please don't kick me out,]

262
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,959
[for the sake of our son!]

263
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,239
[You wanna talk to me about the kid?]

264
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,000
[I agreed to move out]

265
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,159
[to protect him]

266
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:32,800
[from this.]

267
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,760
And now you do such disgusting things?

268
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,120
[Stop the car.]

269
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,439
[Did you even think about our son?]

270
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,239
[Honey,]

271
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,919
[honey,]

272
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,760
[I didn't hurt Haoze!]

273
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,479
[I'm done talking.]

274
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,280
[Are you leaving or not?]

275
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,159
[If you don't go,]

276
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,000
[I'm calling the cops.]

277
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,560
Call the cops if you want!

278
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,560
This is my home too.

279
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,399
Why should I leave?

280
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,040
[Look at you, looking all glamorous.]

281
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,080
Don't forget

282
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,919
how you got here.

283
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,040
Why is

284
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,800
this family broken?

285
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:53,800
Thanks to you.

286
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,840
[Have you ever thought about]

287
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,320
[what this does to me and Haoze?]

288
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:57,439
[When I asked you]

289
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,360
[to sign the divorce papers,]

290
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,040
[why didn't you do it?]

291
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,000
For our son,

292
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,560
I gave you

293
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,600
a decent life.

294
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,320
[You should've just behaved yourself]

295
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,479
[and taken care of Haoze.]

296
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,439
[And look what you've done.]

297
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,479
You have to leave today.

298
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:05,919
Get out!

299
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,199
Are you driving me out

300
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:08,959
for this bitch?

301
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,439
Is that it?

302
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,320
[It's all for her, isn't it?]

303
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
[Enough!]

304
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,760
This is a classy neighborhood.

305
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,239
Mind your language, will you?

306
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,879
Take it up with the lawyer.

307
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
[It's you again.]

308
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:37,199
Mrs. Jia,

309
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,320
hello, hello.

310
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,399
You're the one who

311
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,399
exposed Haoze's mom's secret, right?

312
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,879
Why would you ruin others' families?

313
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,360
I was just doing

314
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,320
what I was asked.

315
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,360
[Mrs. Jia,]

316
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,399
contact me

317
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,239
if you need anything.

318
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:50,719
I'm always at your service.

319
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,159
Thanks.

320
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:56,399
Landing this bid

321
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,800
was perfect timing.

322
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
It gave Xinmiao

323
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,520
a real boost.

324
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,040
Meng'an, well done.

325
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:02,879
Thank you.

326
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,800
But it's really thanks to your sharp eye

327
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,199
for picking such a great project.

328
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,080
Mr. Yu from Blue Ocean led his team.

329
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,560
But they couldn't beat Meng'an.

330
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:13,800
Great job!

331
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:16,879
It was a team effort.

332
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,399
Teamwork makes all the difference.

333
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,520
And of course, we have a great leader.

334
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,800
Exactly.

335
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,360
Everyone,

336
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,879
let's stay united

337
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,120
and keep working hard.

338
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,800
Let's keep it up!

339
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,360
Let's do it!

340
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,040
The boss is in a good mood today,

341
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,479
and he'll treat us to afternoon tea!

342
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,479
Fine, fine.

343
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,800
It's on me.

344
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:41,239
Meng'an,

345
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:41,879
come on in.

346
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,520
Take a seat.

347
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,560
Mr. Zhang,

348
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,560
I want to discuss something with you.

349
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,760
What is it?

350
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,560
No need for discussion.

351
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,800
You're in charge.

352
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,959
You're the big hero of our company.

353
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,320
I'm flattered.

354
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,239
Come on, have a seat.

355
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,320
So, here's the thing.

356
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,120
I'd like to take some time off.

357
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,800
When?

358
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,959
Next week.

359
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,879
How many days?

360
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,919
I was hoping to use up

361
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,320
leftover annual vacation days.

362
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,719
That's... not going to work.

363
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,320
We're in the middle of a critical time.

364
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,000
And you want to take vacation now? You...

365
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,439
It's not like that.

366
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,000
I really have something urgent.

367
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,120
Oh, come on.

368
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,959
You just want a raise,

369
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,679
don't you?

370
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:25,280
No, it's not like that.

371
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,600
Fine, fine, you'll get a raise.

372
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:27,560
A raise?

373
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,159
Seriously?

374
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:33,479
You don't know

375
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,560
what you want.

376
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,080
So...

377
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,280
Well, I still want to take the vacation.

378
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,120
When will you let me

379
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,280
have some time off?

380
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,679
Didn't I just give you

381
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,800
two projects?

382
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,360
You nailed the first one,

383
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,639
and you need to

384
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:54,879
finish the other one too.

385
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,800
[I can't trust anyone else with it.]

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Once these two projects are done,

387
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,959
you can take your annual vacation.

388
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:01,560
Deal?

389
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,000
[I promise I won't go back on it.]

390
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,120
Alright.

391
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:05,560
See?

392
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,000
It's the long-time employees

393
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,399
that I can always count on.

394
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,280
You're the one who can get the job done.

395
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,800
Alright, get back to work.

396
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,280
Okay, I'll head out now.

397
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:43,280
Dad.

398
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,600
An,

399
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,600
come home for dinner this weekend.

400
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,520
Your dad made your favorite

401
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,360
fried ribbonfish.

402
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,679
I'll go buy a softshell turtle later

403
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,919
[and make some nourishing soup for you.]

404
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:56,080
I think I'll pass.

405
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,280
I have to work overtime.

406
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,000
Let Li Lin and Yunjie go instead.

407
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,399
You're not coming home?

408
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,120
Then they don't have to come either.

409
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,000
What's that supposed to mean?

410
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,959
[You're not letting them come home?]

411
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:09,399
No.

412
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,320
I wanted to make this soup

413
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,280
to boost your health.

414
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,679
[They don't need it.]

415
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm just fine.

416
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,679
I don't need it, either.

417
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:19,840
Fine? How?

418
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,040
Last time you came back,

419
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,639
didn't you say

420
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,320
you're in menopause?

421
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,479
No,

422
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,000
it's...  just a common condition.

423
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,159
With the way you're talking,

424
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:32,239
I still don't buy it.

425
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,879
It's nothing, Mom.

426
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:36,520
It's just that

427
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,360
I'm in my forties now,

428
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,439
so it's normal to have

429
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,439
some minor health problems.

430
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,159
Isn't it?

431
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,159
Then send me

432
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,439
your medical records.

433
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,919
There's no medical records.

434
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,000
It was just the annual company

435
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,199
physical exam.

436
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,320
Nothing to worry about.

437
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,800
The more you talk, the less I'm convinced.

438
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,000
[I feel like you're]

439
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,639
[hiding something.]

440
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:56,840
[Just send over the report...]

441
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,000
Alright, I gotta go.

442
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I'll send you

443
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,080
the full report

444
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,040
page by page.

445
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:01,679
Alright?

446
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,919
I think you're just exhausted.

447
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,320
Last time you came home, you looked pale.

448
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,439
How could I look that bad?

449
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,399
If anyone is in trouble, it must be...

450
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,320
No,

451
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,360
nobody's getting...

452
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,239
[Let's just drop it.]

453
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,360
[I'm still at work.]

454
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,959
[Is that okay?]

455
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,560
[I'll try to come home this weekend.]

456
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:21,040
And let's skip the turtle soup.

457
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:22,280
I'm hanging up now.

458
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,040
Pale?

459
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,600
That's not good.

460
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,280
Let's go.

461
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,199
Where to?

462
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,120
To buy the softshell turtle.

463
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,760
She's not even coming home.

464
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,919
Why bother buying it?

465
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,840
We'll get it now and keep it in the pool.

466
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,600
When she comes back,

467
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,679
I'll cook it for her.

468
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,719
Don't bother.

469
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,239
Are you coming or not?

470
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,280
Alright, alright, I'm coming.

471
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:49,879
Wait a second.

472
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:50,919
I need to get ready.

473
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,399
Hurry up.

474
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,719
I'll make sure we've got everything.

475
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,120
Hey, Wanzhen.

476
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,360
Meng'an.

477
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,320
I saw a car leaving

478
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,639
when I got here.

479
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,840
Am I too late?

480
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,600
No worries.

481
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,679
There wasn't much stuff to move anyway.

482
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:21,840
Where's Yu Hai?

483
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,679
Busy with work.

484
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,520
Not even showing up when you're leaving?

485
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,600
How are things

486
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:30,600
between you two?

487
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
We're in the middle of the process.

488
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm moving out first.

489
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,280
Is he stalling

490
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,280
on the divorce?

491
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,760
I already discussed it

492
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,439
with the lawyer.

493
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:43,919
He's raising funds right now.

494
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,199
To protect his shares,

495
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,120
he's likely to agree.

496
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,760
You know,

497
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,199
men always put work first.

498
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,040
I should learn from him on that.

499
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,040
[I'm here!]

500
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,159
Hi, Xin.

501
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:55,800
Meng'an.

502
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:56,600
No need to hurry.

503
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,080
It's alright.

504
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,280
Why'd you come empty-handed?

505
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,159
How's that possible? It's all in the car.

506
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,360
[So where's the new place?]

507
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,199
Wanna check it out?

508
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:03,760
Of course.

509
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:05,560
Let's go.

510
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:06,199
Yeah, let's go.

511
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,600
Come on.

512
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:07,080
Let's go.

513
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:49,879
Didn't you say this was the new place?

514
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,560
It's nicely decorated.

515
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,760
Actually, I bring the kids

516
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,439
over sometimes.

517
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,280
And you never invited me?

518
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,679
Where's the kids' room?

519
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,719
Over there.

520
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,199
I've gotta see

521
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,040
where the two kids are sleeping.

522
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,000
Feeling down?

523
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:10,040
No, I'm fine. Everything will get better.

524
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,679
I should be thanking you

525
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,639
for helping me

526
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,879
find a stable job.

527
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:15,639
That's a lovely place.

528
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,199
And I need to thank Mengxin too,

529
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,719
for helping me with the kids lately.

530
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,239
So

531
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,879
I can focus on my work.

532
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Don't mention it.

533
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,040
They're all classmates.

534
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,520
If you need anything,

535
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,439
just call me.

536
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,320
Okay.

537
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,679
I love your apartment!

538
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,959
It's so cozy and comfortable.

539
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:34,040
It's good to have a place like this.

540
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,280
I'm going to talk to Haowen

541
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:37,879
about buying one too.

542
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,239
In case we ever have a fight,

543
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,600
I'll have somewhere to go.

544
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,919
Even if you have a fight,

545
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,679
he'd be the one to get kicked out.

546
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,000
Doesn't matter.

547
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:45,840
I still want

548
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
my own space.

549
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,159
Aren't you in real estate?

550
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,679
Help me find an apartment, will you?

551
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,520
No problem.

552
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,239
Why do you need so many houses?

553
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,879
You can never have too many.

554
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,840
They're solid investments

555
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,080
and hold their value.

556
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:58,600
See?

557
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,239
That's the gap between the rich and the poor.

558
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,080
They buy a house on a whim,

559
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,439
For salaried folks like us,

560
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,159
even with the whole family chipping in,

561
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,399
we can barely afford the down payment.

562
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:07,959
A house is just a house.

563
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,040
As long as you're with

564
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,679
someone you love,

565
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,679
that's what makes it a home.

566
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,560
That's correct.

567
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,360
Come on.

568
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:13,439
Let's cut the cake

569
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,239
to celebrate you moving into a new place.

570
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:17,760
Starting today,

571
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,199
I'm beginning my

572
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,040
new life!

573
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,520
Mengxin's gone.

574
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,600
Why are you still hanging around?

575
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,159
I was just thinking I'd help you

576
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:40,479
tidy up a bit.

577
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,600
Nonsense.

578
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:43,320
Spill the truth.

579
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:44,080
What's up?

580
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:49,159
I don't have much time.

581
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,399
I've got to pick up the kids later.

582
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:58,360
I'm pregnant.

583
00:31:59,159 --> 00:31:59,959
You're pregnant?

584
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,239
Congrats!

585
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,879
You and Li Lin must be in great shape.

586
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:06,159
At your age, getting pregnant is not easy.

587
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
You didn't go for IVF, did you?

588
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:08,800
IVF? Please.

589
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,919
We're just healthy.

590
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,879
That's all.

591
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:11,879
That's impressive.

592
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:12,239
Well,

593
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,600
why don't we call Mengxin over?

594
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,479
This is worth celebrating.

595
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:15,399
No, no, no.

596
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,520
I haven't told her.

597
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,560
They don't know yet.

598
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:18,080
Right, right.

599
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,280
Better not to tell in the first three months.

600
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,560
How far along?

601
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,719
When's the due date?

602
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:23,199
I don't want this baby.

603
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,760
You don't?

604
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,120
Why not?

605
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,840
[Getting pregnant at your age isn't easy.]

606
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,080
That is a good thing.

607
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,360
Why wouldn't you want it?

608
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
What's good about it?

609
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,520
Ever since

610
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,840
I found this out,

611
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,639
I've been torn.

612
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,840
We just can't afford it.

613
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,600
But aren't you and Li Lin

614
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,679
doing fine?

615
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,959
That was before.

616
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,679
Li Lin lost his job.

617
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,800
I'm the only one supporting the family.

618
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,600
If it weren't for

619
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,159
my parents helping out,

620
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,679
we couldn't even pay the mortgage.

621
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:56,439
Even though he's unemployed,

622
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,639
he can find another job.

623
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,479
He's been looking for months.

624
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,000
Now he's working at a delivery station.

625
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,399
What does Li Lin think?

626
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,040
I haven't told him.

627
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,120
Meng'an,

628
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,199
having a baby

629
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
isn't a small matter.

630
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,280
I'm not going to

631
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,520
tell you what to do,

632
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,639
but let me tell you

633
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,199
about Yu Hai and me.

634
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,719
[Do you know why I]

635
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,399
[have to divorce him?]

636
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,199
Because I don't think

637
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,399
being with him

638
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,320
is better than being on my own.

639
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,879
All these years,

640
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,280
he's been wrapped up in his work,

641
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:40,719
and I've been

642
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,439
left to eat alone,

643
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,520
sleep alone,

644
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,000
and raise our children alone.

645
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:46,639
In that house,

646
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:48,080
I couldn't even

647
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,280
feel his presence.

648
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:52,120
[But that's just the surface.]

649
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,360
[The real problem is,]

650
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,479
we don't talk anymore.

651
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,600
We're like strangers.

652
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,479
[But you and Li Lin are different.]

653
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,199
[You've always had a strong bond]

654
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:09,199
[and support each other.]

655
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,600
Don't let a secret like this

656
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,320
come between

657
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,399
you two.

658
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,120
Besides,

659
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,199
he's your husband

660
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,600
and the baby's father.

661
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,480
At least,

662
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,679
he deserves to know.

663
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,520
Heading to the delivery station again?

664
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:48,880
Yeah, I'm on shift tonight.

665
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,080
But I'll be back in the morning

666
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,239
to make breakfast for Yunjie.

667
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,239
[You get some rest.]

668
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,199
Can't you skip tonight?

669
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,880
Night shifts are really exhausting.

670
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,159
At least ask them to

671
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,120
switch you to days.

672
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,400
All the deliveries come in at night.

673
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:03,799
If I worked days,

674
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,000
I'd have to be a delivery rider.

675
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,960
And the hours wouldn't work.

676
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,199
Who'd take care of Yunjie?

677
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,799
[Don't worry about it.]

678
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,600
Just get some sleep.

679
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,880
Has anyone called you

680
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:16,880
for an interview?

681
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:25,839
Take a rest.

682
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,199
I'm leaving now.

683
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:27,920
Wait, don't go yet.

684
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,359
There's something I need to tell you.

685
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,159
You're pregnant?

686
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,400
So, you're really pregnant.

687
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,560
I had a feeling before.

688
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,359
What feeling?

689
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,359
I don't want this baby.

690
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,480
Why not?

691
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,719
What do you mean why?

692
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:20,480
I just don't.

693
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,159
With our financial situation,

694
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,600
it's impossible to have another child.

695
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,719
We're struggling to raise one kid...

696
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,839
How can we handle two?

697
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,560
But honey,

698
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,639
we can make it work.

699
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,000
Make what work?

700
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,359
Having a second child?

701
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,880
You're unemployed.

702
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:42,679
If I were to be on maternity leave,

703
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,279
where would we get the money?

704
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,199
What would we live on?

705
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,239
I've made up my mind.

706
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,920
[This is how it has to be.]

707
00:36:58,319 --> 00:36:59,359
I'll find a time

708
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,799
and get the abortion.

709
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,600
Don't.

710
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:06,199
The situation at home is one thing,

711
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,600
but this is a big decision.

712
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,199
We can't

713
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,600
rush into it.

714
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,480
Let's think it over.

715
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,960
I'm done thinking.

716
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,040
Let's take some more time.

717
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,440
Think it through.

718
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,040
[Drive that way, head to the front.]

719
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,480
[Back it up!]

720
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,560
Back! Go, go, go!

721
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:28,600
Good.

722
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,920
Xiongxiong's asleep.

723
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,199
Hold on.

724
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:54,839
Almost done.

725
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:55,560
Okay.

726
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,080
All set.

727
00:38:58,839 --> 00:38:59,480
Go ahead.

728
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:00,600
Feel free to browse through it.

729
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,359
You don't have another phone, do you?

730
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,480
Babe,

731
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,960
I'm all yours.

732
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:07,600
Think about it.

733
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,799
You're carrying

734
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:09,520
our second baby.

735
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,759
How could I be

736
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:11,520
fooling around?

737
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,319
I wouldn't do that.

738
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:13,799
Fine. l gotta tell you something.

739
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,600
Go ahead.

740
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,679
I want to buy an apartment.

741
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,440
Sweetheart,

742
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,839
we already have such a big house.

743
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,639
Why get an apartment?

744
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,839
It's cramped, not right for you.

745
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,120
I need my own space,

746
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,560
a place to clear my head.

747
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,520
I need a backup plan.

748
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,319
In case,

749
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,719
in case,

750
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:29,759
some day you...

751
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,639
Don't cry, baby.

752
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:33,279
That's not going to happen.

753
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,520
I, I'm not that kind of guy.

754
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,120
That's impossible.

755
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:35,920
There won't be such a day.

756
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,880
If that day ever comes,

757
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,319
I promise,

758
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:38,480
the house, the car, and the savings

759
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:38,920
are all yours.

760
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,719
I'll walk away with nothing.

761
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,600
Don't make empty promises.

762
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,920
Just tell me if you agree.

763
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,679
I agree.

764
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,719
Your word is my command.

765
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:47,239
Now that's more like it.

766
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I'm going to shower.

767
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,000
Go ahead.

768
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,239
Alright.

769
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Shower time.

770
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,719
Jia Haowen!

771
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,480
Coming!

772
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,279
What is it?

773
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,560
You're agreeing to everything I say.

774
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,319
Do you have something to hide?

775
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,920
I'll be screwed.

776
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:15,679
Screwed?

777
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:17,639
Why did he say that?

778
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:20,040
Is he really hiding something?

779
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
[Alright, kids,]

780
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,199
from now on, the three of us

781
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,040
are going to sleep

782
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,600
in this room together.

783
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,880
Do you like it here?

784
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,679
Yes!

785
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,799
As long as I'm with Mom, I'll love it.

786
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:33,520
Really?

787
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,600
Of course.

788
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,000
But Mom,

789
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,960
why are we moving

790
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,560
into this small apartment?

791
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,159
Because I

792
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,560
need to work now.

793
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:44,120
And besides, I can't

794
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,480
afford the big house anymore.

795
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,120
Mom,

796
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,400
are you really going to leave Dad?

797
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:50,799
A divorce?

798
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,480
Like Sarah's parents?

799
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:53,839
Yes,

800
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,359
that's right.

801
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,159
But,

802
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,199
Dad's always been good to us.

803
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,000
And he'll still

804
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,600
be good to you.

805
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,319
Mom,

806
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:04,480
are you leaving Dad

807
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,440
because he is a workaholic

808
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,880
and doesn't come home?

809
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,080
Not exactly.

810
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,600
How do I explain this to you?

811
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,679
Do you have

812
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:15,199
such friends

813
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,040
who were really close

814
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,520
but then slowly

815
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,920
grew apart?

816
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,120
Yes.

817
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:22,759
Yeah, I do.

818
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:24,920
When you're elder,

819
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,639
I'll explain 

820
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,400
what happened 

821
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,679
between me and Dad, okay?

822
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,040
Mom,

823
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,639
do you have to work every day?

824
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:32,679
Yes, just like you go to school,

825
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,080
I have to work from Monday to Friday.

826
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,000
And you'll need to take the school bus.

827
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,279
No more sleeping in.

828
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,199
And don't be late.

829
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,199
Got it?

830
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:39,799
Yes.

831
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,560
Okay.

832
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,679
But isn't working

833
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,000
Dad's job?

834
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,000
How can you say that?

835
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:46,679
Mom can work too.

836
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,159
A lot of classmates'

837
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:49,560
moms work, right?

838
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:50,359
Yes.

839
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:52,000
My job

840
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,679
used to be

841
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,159
taking care of you two little ones.

842
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,319
But now you're

843
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,799
big girls in second grade.

844
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:58,080
So don't you think

845
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,600
it's time I had a new role too?

846
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:01,759
Mom, I support you.

847
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:02,960
I support you even more.

848
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:04,279
My sweethearts,

849
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:06,040
I love you so much.

850
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,080
You're the best kids

851
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,000
in the world.

852
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,359
Come here,

853
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,279
Mommy loves you.

854
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,600
What? Didn't I tell you

855
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,279
even if something serious happens today,

856
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:28,759
don't call me?

857
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:29,759
But, Mr. Yu,

858
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,839
it's about

859
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,799
Yaohui Investments.

860
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,799
What's the problem?

861
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,639
It seems

862
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,440
Mr. Zhou of Yaohui Investments

863
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:36,639
isn't too interested

864
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,799
in our company.

865
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,319
I see.

866
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:46,520
[Welcome, Mr. Zhou.]

867
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,560
[Your reserved bottle, sir.]

868
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,560
Mr. Zhou,

869
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,560
Zhou Yao, right?

870
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,480
And you are?

871
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,560
Yu Hai,

872
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:20,359
from Blue Ocean Media.

873
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,080
It rings a bell.

874
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,560
That media company.

875
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,920
I'll have what he's having.

876
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,759
Sorry, sir.

877
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,759
That's Mr. Zhou's private reserve.
