3
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,320
The lecture Wang Zhe mentioned,

4
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,520
are you signing up or not?

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,999
I don't know yet.

6
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,520
Ms. Xue

7
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,359
already called your Mom in for a talk.

8
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,600
You didn't get good results

9
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,839
in the past two mock exams.

10
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,559
Why not attend the lecture?

11
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,439
Yeah, if my mom finds out,

12
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm probably done.

13
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,759
Sign up, and let's go together.

14
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,559
At least we'd have company.

15
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,800
Liu Siming's Mom

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
already signed him up.

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,480
I saw it in

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,839
my mom's parents' chat group.

19
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:25,960
I can only hope

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
my mom's too busy with work

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,159
to check the chat messages.

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
As long as she doesn't push it,

23
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,839
my dad won't force me

24
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,719
to sign up.

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
My dad is

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,879
a bit different from other parents.

27
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,559
He says studying is like

28
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,080
competing with oneself.

29
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,759
So no need to stress

30
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,839
over short-term wins and losses.

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,839
Stop showing off.

32
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,159
I'm not going.

33
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,439
I'm joining the performance.

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,520
Your mom was called to school.

35
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,879
With your grades right now,

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,240
you have to push yourself

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,319
and put in

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,360
some extra effort.

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
Didn't you say studying is like a marathon?

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,080
Don't sweat

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,279
the small stuff.

42
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,400
I meant that strategically.

43
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
I mean,

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,920
one should have

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,800
a long-term goal.

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,719
And right now, your goal

47
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,719
is the high-school entrance exam,

48
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,279
right?

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,520
There are only six months left.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,559
You need to tackle those hurdles

51
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,439
bit by bit.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,400
I'll skip this one.

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,279
But I'll go next time, okay?

54
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,599
Are you kidding me?

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,879
This is for your own good.

56
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,439
And besides,

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,039
you don't take piano lessons now.

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,360
Why bother with the performance?

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,520
What's the point?

60
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,839
I'm doing this for you!

61
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,080
No, that's not true.

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,319
You're doing it for yourself!

63
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,680
Ever since mom got pregnant,

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,319
you haven't cared about

65
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,200
anything at home.

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,080
When the new baby comes,

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,360
you'll probably forget all about me.

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,559
I don't care?

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,400
I've been helping with

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,960
your homework...

71
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Enough, enough.

72
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,599
Just stop arguing!

73
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,559
You think I don't care?

74
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,520
Look,

75
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,319
Yunjie,

76
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,559
there's still time before

77
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,640
the entrance exam.

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,159
I've got an idea.

79
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,759
How about I pull some strings

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,120
and get Yunjie into

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,960
the top school in our county?

82
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,559
What do you think?

83
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,480
Good.

84
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:03,400
Great idea!

85
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,279
It's decided then.

86
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,400
Dad!

87
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,800
What?

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,319
Your dad

89
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,559
went to that school years ago.

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Ask him.

91
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
It's a strict school,

92
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,480
and you have to study hard there.

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,039
Even your cousin Huahua

94
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,599
got into a university in Beijing

95
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,719
from there.

96
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,839
Got it?

97
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm not going!

98
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,399
Hey,

99
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,920
do you have something cooking on the stove?

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,360
I smell something burning.

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,480
Oh no, I forgot!

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,199
Please, be good, okay?

103
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,319
Auntie got too busy and forgot.

104
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,680
I don't care.

105
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,840
I'm not going.

106
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,920
I want to be in the performance!

107
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,160
So?

108
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,720
I said what I needed to.

109
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
Well, you blew it.

110
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
Fine, let's see if you can do better.

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,319
I won't give up easily.

112
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,519
Let's see what you've got.

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,959
I told you before,

114
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,439
you can't raise a kid like that.

115
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:16,999
But you...

116
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,079
It's important to find the right approach.

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
But you insist on doing it your way.

118
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,759
You just don't get it.

119
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,639
Just leave it to me.

120
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,040
And I've done

121
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,079
a great job so far.

122
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,040
You just have to...

123
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
Now she's upset.

124
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,879
She might even

125
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,040
smash the piano.

126
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,319
That's beautiful.

127
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,519
You know,

128
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,199
every day when I leave for work,

129
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,360
the moment I step out that door,

130
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,199
I feel like

131
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
I'm going into battle.

132
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,559
But when I step through this door,

133
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,680
I think to myself,

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,480
this home is just perfect.

135
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,120
I've got such a

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,399
wonderful daughter.

137
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,199
And my heart

138
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
softens right up.

139
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,999
I feel my heart

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,199
is wrapped in love

141
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,439
and contentment.

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
That's vivid.

143
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,439
I should jot this down.

144
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,040
I might use it for my next essay.

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
Don't change the subject, okay?

146
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,199
I'm, after all,

147
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,079
a journalism graduate.

148
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,439
OK?

149
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,840
I know how to be sentimental.

150
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
You're good at liberal arts.

151
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
You get that from me.

152
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,319
Dad always says,

153
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,079
I'm not good at science,

154
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,280
and that's your fault too.

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
I'd say his genes

156
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,879
just couldn't beat mine.

157
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,639
Mom, you

158
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,399
never lose an argument.

159
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,120
Not always.

160
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,280
Sometimes

161
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
when I can't find the right words,

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
I'll lose.

163
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,439
When I think about it later,

164
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,999
I regret not saying

165
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,199
those few lines.

166
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,840
Right?

167
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,439
Exactly!

168
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,519
That's the feeling!

169
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,360
Spot on.

170
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,439
It's all a strategy.

171
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,079
Mom,

172
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,959
what did the teacher talk to you about?

173
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,879
Oh, nothing much.

174
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,199
She just showed me

175
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
some of your test papers.

176
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,840
Your teacher also said,

177
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,920
you've had a lot of new material

178
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
to learn lately.

179
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,519
So you haven't had

180
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,240
much time to review.

181
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,519
Let's take some time

182
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,800
to go over the new stuff, okay?

183
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Just consolidate what you've learned,

184
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,720
and your grades will go up.

185
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,600
Right?

186
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,720
But I've been

187
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,240
so exhausted lately.

188
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,079
That's common.

189
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm stressed too.

190
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,319
You know I'm pregnant

191
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,079
and still working.

192
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
I have to be extra careful at the office.

193
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,120
I can't afford any mistakes.

194
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,639
Plus, I'm training new hires.

195
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,160
I've also got to assign all the work

196
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,559
before taking my maternity leave.

197
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,600
If I don't

198
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
plan everything well,

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
when I come back from leave,

200
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
I might not have a job waiting for me.

201
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,800
Is it really that serious?

202
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,920
What do you think?

203
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,160
Let me tell you,

204
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
the workplace is brutal.

205
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,600
Doing a good job doesn't always
guarantee promotions or raises.

206
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,160
But if you screw up,

207
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,639
and you're definitely getting the boot.

208
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,160
Playing the pity card?

209
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,439
Getting into high school isn't easy either.

210
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,680
So,

211
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,319
let's work hard together,

212
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:28,999
shall we?

213
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,959
We can set a schedule

214
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,639
and stick to it.

215
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,079
You focus on studying for exams,

216
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,399
and I'll focus on having this baby.

217
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,959
It's just six months,

218
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,959
we'll get through it.

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,519
Mom,

220
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,639
I feel like

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,399
Dad,

222
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,200
he doesn't like me as much anymore.

223
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,759
How could that be?

224
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,759
My sweet girl,

225
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,080
that's impossible.

226
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,560
Honestly,

227
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,720
I haven't fully come to terms

228
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,200
with you having another baby.

229
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,279
But recently,

230
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,440
Grandpa has been sick,

231
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,759
Auntie had an early delivery,

232
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,960
and you need bed rest,

233
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,039
I think I need to be more grown-up about it.

234
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,600
You've been through so much.

235
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,399
My poor baby.

236
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:14,720
Honey.

237
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm here.

238
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,960
Hurry up. Say something.

239
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,960
Your daughter even thinks

240
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,080
you don't love her anymore.

241
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,240
What? That's not true!

242
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,999
How could I not love you?

243
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,120
You're my daughter, Yunjie.

244
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,080
I still remember it like yesterday

245
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,159
the first time I held you in my arms.

246
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,399
When you were just born,

247
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,600
the nurse handed you to me

248
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,840
and told me to hold you a bit higher.

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,039
Your tiny head

250
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,399
was snuggled right up against me.

251
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,560
I was so tense that

252
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,960
my upper body was frozen.

253
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,279
I couldn't even move.

254
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,639
I was terrified that if I did,

255
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,440
I might hurt you.

256
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
But I was so happy.

257
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,600
It was the first time

258
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,039
I'd ever felt such pure joy.

259
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,519
And then the first time

260
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,039
I took you to kindergarten.

261
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
The first day of elementary school.

262
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,560
The first day of middle school.

263
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,399
All those firsts,

264
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,560
no one else could give me that.

265
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
Yunjie,

266
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,519
this whole second child thing

267
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,279
it's not as heavy as you think.

268
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,399
Do you know what your teacher

269
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,679
said about this?

270
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,720
She said,

271
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,600
it's like playing a game.

272
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,679
You're like the main account.

273
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,759
The second child is like an alt account.

274
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:03,639
Even if we're leveling up the alt,

275
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,560
we still

276
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,679
keep the main account logged in.

277
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,560
What kind of comparison that?

278
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,999
Well, it might sound odd, but it's true.

279
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,279
Yeah.

280
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,320
You're a teenager now.

281
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,759
We know

282
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,639
you have the urge to push boundaries

283
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,120
and to break free.

284
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,080
But we don't

285
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,759
want you to

286
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,039
push us away.

287
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm not trying to oppose you.

288
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,080
And it's not that I don't
want to attend the lecture.

289
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,759
I just want to

290
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,240
end my piano journey

291
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,080
on a high note.

292
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,039
Didn't you always say

293
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,240
to finish what you start?

294
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,679
To have a sense of closure?

295
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
Yeah, that's it.

296
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,240
Okay.

297
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,999
Alright.

298
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,320
Go ahead.

299
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,279
You've got my support.

300
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,480
Awesome!

301
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:02,120
Count me in.

302
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,679
Come on!

303
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,039
Stand up, both of you.

304
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,360
Alright.

305
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,879
I can't squat down.

306
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Where is your sister?

307
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,159
She went to buy soy sauce.

308
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,999
What's she cooking in the pot?

309
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,240
Yeah, it smells so strong.

310
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,999
What, what is this?

311
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,679
What is she cooking?

312
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,960
Why so many ingredients?

313
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,759
Is my lamb kidney soup ready?

314
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,039
Jing, what on earth did you make?

315
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,919
Eucommia Lamb Kidney Soup.
Drink when it's still warm.

316
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,879
What?

317
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,879
Just lamb kidneys.

318
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,039
No wonder.

319
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,200
That smell... it's quite unpleasant.

320
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,039
Can't you smell it?

321
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,519
What a waste.

322
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,159
Well, you can drink it.

323
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,279
Why should I?

324
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,279
I'm not the one on bed rest.

325
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,279
These herbs are expensive.

326
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,919
Besides,

327
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
men need to take care of their health too,

328
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,639
especially in middle ages.

329
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
I don't need it. I'm perfectly healthy.

330
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,200
Nonsense.

331
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
It's good for your health.

332
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,039
You know?

333
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,679
This...

334
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:28,999
These two

335
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,080
know nothing about nourishing food.

336
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,080
But yeah, that smell is pretty strong.

337
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,480
Take the baby away, take her away!

338
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,759
I'm not breastfeeding. I don't have milk.

339
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,639
Mrs. Jia, look,

340
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,960
isn't our Little Watermelon adorable?

341
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,200
Get out.

342
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,080
Hurry, out!

343
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,120
Leave me alone!

344
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,999
Quick, quick, out.

345
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,159
She's asleep now.

346
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,480
So lovely.

347
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,840
How pretty.

348
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,159
Honey, honey.

349
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,120
You, get out too.

350
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,039
You're ugly too.

351
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,759
Of course I'm ugly, I know. But sweetie,

352
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,960
our Little Watermelon isn't.

353
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,600
She's a real beauty, you know?

354
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,200
Don't touch me.

355
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,759
What an ugly smile.

356
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,600
What's up?

357
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,919
Honey,

358
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,240
do you know

359
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
what you remind me of

360
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
right now?

361
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,440
A queen from Journey to the West.

362
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Which one?

363
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,639
Is she beautiful?

364
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,480
She is stunning.

365
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,679
Prettier than me?

366
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,279
Of course not.

367
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:44,840
You remind me of

368
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,480
someone from that novel too.

369
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:47,919
Who?

370
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,960
Pigsy.

371
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:51,879
Honey,

372
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,560
I'm not even as good as him.

373
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,999
He can wield

374
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,399
that nine-toothed rake.

375
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,759
I'm nothing compared to him.

376
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,519
My ugliness only makes

377
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,480
your beauty shine brighter.

378
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,279
Your grace

379
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,999
and charm

380
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:02,919
are unparalleled.

381
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,759
You've been reading a lot lately, huh?

382
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,799
Absolutely, my love.

383
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,159
I've been reading to learn

384
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
how to praise

385
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,960
my beautiful wife.

386
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,399
I'm thirsty.

387
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,639
I want some water.

388
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm on it.

389
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,919
Your wish is my command!

390
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,200
Clank, clank, clank!

391
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,479
Jing,

392
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm heading out.

393
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,600
It's so late,

394
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,800
aren't you going to work?

395
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,080
Not to the office.
I've got to meet someone.

396
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,760
Hold on a second.

397
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,280
Pick a pair.

398
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,320
Me?

399
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,280
Yeah.

400
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,800
Now that you're pregnant,

401
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,439
you've got to stay warm,

402
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:58,239
especially your feet.

403
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:00,919
But I'm pregnant,

404
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:01,959
my body's burning with energy.

405
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,120
And it's already so hot outside.

406
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,239
Wearing these will make me sweat.

407
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,000
Well,

408
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,040
that's where you're mistaken.

409
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,560
In Traditional Chinese Medicine,

410
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,439
we say it's external heat but internal deficiency.

411
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,439
In Western medicine,

412
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,560
pregnancy hormones

413
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,639
are making your joints

414
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,679
loosen up,

415
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,280
leaving you vulnerable

416
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,199
to the cold wind.

417
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,080
The worst part is,

418
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,159
it'll affect you for the rest of your life.

419
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,040
When you're older,

420
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,560
you'll suffer

421
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,320
arthritis,

422
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,239
sore legs, and other diseases.

423
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,040
Fine, fine,

424
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,159
I'll wear them.

425
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,239
Is that okay?

426
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,600
Put them on.

427
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:51,719
Got it.

428
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,320
You must keep

429
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
your feet warm.

430
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,120
Give me.

431
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,719
Good. That's better.

432
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,399
Alright, I'm off now.

433
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,479
With you around,

434
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,760
I don't have to worry about anything.

435
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,239
Take care.

436
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,080
Will do.

437
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,639
Alright, I'm heading out.

438
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,800
Okay.

439
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,800
That's hot.

440
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,239
Good thing she takes my advice.

441
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,199
I'll put these in the closet for her.

442
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,360
That's better.

443
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,840
So cute.

444
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,800
Little Watermelon.

445
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,040
Look, look, look.

446
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,479
Over here.

447
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:50,719
Look,

448
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,719
Mommy's here to see you.

449
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,000
Mommy's here.

450
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
Time for a little massage.

451
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:56,479
How do we do it?

452
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:57,360
Well, follow my lead.

453
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,959
Okay.

454
00:19:58,399 --> 00:19:58,760
I'll do it.

455
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,040
Yes, see? Like this.

456
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,800
Like this, gently rub upwards.

457
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,439
Got it.

458
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,479
I need a bit more massage oil.

459
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,760
Here.

460
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,479
My hands are a bit rough.

461
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,320
Nice and gentle.

462
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,600
One, two, three.

463
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,399
Have a try.

464
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,399
Be gentle.

465
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,280
That's it.

466
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:10,560
Slower, please.

467
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
Yes, a bit higher.

468
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,439
Perfect.

469
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:13,760
Feels so good, right, baby?

470
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,879
How many times a day should we do this?

471
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,040
Once after

472
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,679
every bath.

473
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,239
After every bath?

474
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,879
It helps newborns sleep better.

475
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,840
Look how quickly your daddy's learning!

476
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,239
You're such a good dad.

477
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:23,639
Thanks.

478
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,080
Let's start with the armpits,
then go upwards.

479
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,919
The armpits.

480
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:27,679
Yeah, both sides.

481
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,479
Then upwards.

482
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,280
Now gently move the baby's little arms.

483
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,159
Move them?

484
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:32,959
Yes, like this.

485
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,679
That's right.

486
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,679
Gently, gently.

487
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:36,840
Well done.

488
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,919
This is my second child.

489
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,919
Second one?

490
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,360
That explains why

491
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,840
you're such a pro.

492
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,080
See? Isn't Daddy doing a great job?

493
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,600
Isn't he learning

494
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,120
really fast?

495
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,040
Now, let's rub the baby's tummy.

496
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,159
A gentle tummy rub.

497
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,280
That's impressive.

498
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,639
Congratulations!

499
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,280
Thank you.

500
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,800
It's only been a few months,

501
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,120
and you're like a whole new person!

502
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,439
I'm thinking of switching careers.

503
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,239
Back to investment banks?

504
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,520
Yeah, I like doing this kind of job.

505
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,320
And after these past few months,

506
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,399
I've gained some insight

507
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:31,040
into the job market.

508
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,840
I think I'm ready to jump back in.

509
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,239
Have you sent out any resumes?

510
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,719
Yeah, to a few

511
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,600
solid firms in finance.

512
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,919
I'm in the first round of interviews now.

513
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
Need me to bring Rachel in

514
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,679
for help?

515
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,199
No, thanks.

516
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,320
I've got this.

517
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,239
Great.

518
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,159
Can't wait to hear the good news.

519
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:47,560
Thanks.

520
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,679
How about you?

521
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
You're pregnant

522
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,800
and still working.

523
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
How are you holding up?

524
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,679
Physically, I'm okay.

525
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,879
But mentally...

526
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,679
Here is the thing.

527
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,800
You know,

528
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,639
when you're a 40-year-old woman

529
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,399
in the workplace,

530
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,439
and suddenly everyone's

531
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:07,959
more focused on your belly

532
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,040
than your work,

533
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:11,919
it makes me feel odd,

534
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,199
and I'm still not getting used to it.

535
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,479
But at the same time,

536
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,600
it's complicated.

537
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,120
Because

538
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,439
I can't let myself get too tired,

539
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,800
but I also don't want others thinking

540
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,679
I'm slacking off.

541
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,840
Finding that balance

542
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,479
is kinda tricky.

543
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,439
Yeah.

544
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,479
Well,

545
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:31,360
when I was pregnant,

546
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,040
I already left work.

547
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,199
So I can't fully relate to

548
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,199
how you're feeling.

549
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,600
But I bet you've got everything under control.

550
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,320
I know you too well.

551
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,919
Stop playing the sympathy card with me.

552
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,479
Alright,

553
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,800
you got me.

554
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,560
I've made some arrangements,

555
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,879
but I have to see how things go.

556
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:54,600
As long as the boss

557
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,879
doesn't give me a hard time,

558
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,879
I should be able to manage.

559
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,639
Well, you must

560
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,679
hang in there.

561
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:02,879
That's not easy

562
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,719
at our age.

563
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,080
The resilience we had
when we were young,

564
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,760
there's not much

565
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
left of it now.

566
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,879
If it's so tough,

567
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,159
why don't you just quit?

568
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,679
How could I?

569
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,600
That's not an option.

570
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
You're trying to trick me?

571
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:24,040
It's fine to vent out

572
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,080
negative feelings sometimes,

573
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,959
but we still

574
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,000
need to stay hopeful

575
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,919
about the future.

576
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,399
Keep going,

577
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:32,959
I believe in you.

578
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:36,439
You're so cheeky.

579
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:37,959
Mr. Jia,

580
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,239
you have strong

581
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,399
resilience and

582
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,399
adaptability.

583
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:44,919
You've been optimistic about
having a second child,

584
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,719
without the anxiety or stress

585
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,120
that first-time fathers often experience.

586
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Doctor,

587
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,959
I'm not anxious

588
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,120
or depressed at all.

589
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,040
In fact, I'm thrilled!

590
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:57,959
Honestly, I didn't even

591
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:58,679
need this test.

592
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:59,760
I only came

593
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,520
because my wife

594
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,040
didn't want to.

595
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,320
Your wife...

596
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,080
From what I've observed recently,

597
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,040
I think she's

598
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,840
showing signs of postpartum depression.

599
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:09,800
Depression?

600
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,399
What should I do?

601
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,840
Don't worry too much.

602
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,159
Clinically,

603
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,600
around 40% of women

604
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:17,560
experience

605
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,719
different levels of

606
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,679
postpartum depression.

607
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,080
During this time,

608
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,399
you should spend more time with her

609
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
and be as understanding as possible.

610
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,239
After childbirth,

611
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,800
her hormone levels

612
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,719
drop drastically,

613
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,040
and this can cause

614
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,600
both physical and emotional

615
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,760
challenges.

616
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:34,840
Doctor,

617
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,520
as a professional,

618
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,000
you understand people's minds

619
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
better than

620
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,520
most of us.

621
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,600
Given my wife's situation,

622
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,760
how can I help her?

623
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,239
You'll need to be patient

624
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,679
and try to get her to open up.

625
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,760
But it's also important that

626
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,040
you, as her husband,

627
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,439
provide her with support and security.

628
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,760
As long as Xin is happy,

629
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,120
I'll do whatever it takes.

630
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,560
Doctor,

631
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,080
I've been feeling overwhelmingly

632
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,360
excited and joyful.

633
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,399
Is there something wrong

634
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,800
with me too?

635
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,239
Look,

636
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,840
the meals at the postpartum center

637
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,520
are really nutritious,

638
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,360
but she finds them tasteless.

639
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,439
She keeps asking for other things,

640
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
but then doesn't eat those either.

641
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,679
Then she insists on eating

642
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,760
only what her mom makes.

643
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,120
Now that it's here,

644
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,479
she still won't touch it.

645
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,000
Mom, it's okay.

646
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,520
I just don't know what she
really wants to eat.

647
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,600
Alright, alright, it won't go to waste.

648
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,760
Please lower your voice.

649
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,120
Just take it home for you and the driver.

650
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,080
It's very nutritious.

651
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,280
Haowen, let me tell you something,

652
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,679
you can't

653
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,239
keep spoiling Xin like this.

654
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:45,399
Don't you see

655
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,040
the way she treats you?

656
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,600
I can't stand it.

657
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:50,080
Mom, I'm not spoiling her.

658
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,320
It's postpartum depression.

659
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,159
The doctor said,

660
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,120
she needs our support now

661
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,639
more than ever.

662
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,959
We need to help her through this together.

663
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,639
What?

664
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,159
Postpartum depression?

665
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,080
Is that even a thing?

666
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,520
I've been through this.

667
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,840
What don't I know?

668
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,479
She's just using

669
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,919
this postpartum thing

670
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:08,120
as an excuse to boss you around.

671
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
No, Mom.

672
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,360
Xin has never been like this.

673
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
She's always been so good to me.

674
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,760
Why didn't she act like this

675
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,919
after having your first child?

676
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,000
That was when she was younger.

677
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,239
And back then,

678
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,320
I was busy with work.

679
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,239
And this time,

680
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,360
it was a C-section.

681
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,560
She has a big scar on her belly.

682
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,239
It hasn't healed well,

683
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,560
so of course, she's feeling upset.

684
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,919
Haowen, let me tell you,

685
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:28,679
if you let her

686
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,959
have her way this time,

687
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,439
you'll regret it later.

688
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,080
You'll end up making money

689
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,560
and taking care of her too.

690
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:36,879
Why should you have to do it all?

691
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,959
Mom, that's such old thinking.

692
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,679
When we first got married,

693
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,600
I didn't have a penny

694
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,800
to my name,

695
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,639
and she stuck with me

696
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:44,679
through it all.

697
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:45,360
Besides,

698
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,600
she's given you a grandson

699
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,560
and a granddaughter.

700
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,040
You should be happy about it.

701
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,159
Mom, besides you,

702
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,120
there's no other woman

703
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,080
in this world

704
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
who treats me as well as she does.

705
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,439
I know.

706
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,919
I'm just worried about you.

707
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,840
You have

708
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,479
been here with her

709
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,800
for almost a month now.

710
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,280
Aren't you going back to work?

711
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
Guess why I chose to
run my own company.

712
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,560
That's because

713
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,679
I can go to the office when I want to

714
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:07,479
and skip it when I don't.

715
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,159
I can work when I feel like it

716
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,280
and take off when I don't.

717
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,000
But won't that affect your company?

718
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,719
You've got so many employees
depending on you.

719
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,239
Aren't you usually very busy?

720
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:15,679
Mom,

721
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,320
that's what employees are for,

722
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,919
to handle the business for me.

723
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,479
Mom, here.

724
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,360
This is for you.

725
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,840
What's this?

726
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:24,840
What do you think?

727
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,919
You're my mom.

728
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,080
I know exactly what you like.

729
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:28,239
Go ahead, open it.

730
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,040
A gold bracelet?

731
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,280
Take it, Mom.

732
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:33,800
What's this for?

733
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,439
To help you

734
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
cool off a little.

735
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,520
So you are doing this for your wife?

736
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,280
Mom,

737
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,080
please remember,

738
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,199
you're here to

739
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,239
help take care of Xin

740
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,919
and your grandchildren,

741
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,679
not to argue with your daughter-in-law.

742
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,679
I know.

743
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,840
But did you see how she treats me?

744
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,159
I'm still her elder, after all.

745
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,840
Mom,

746
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,080
she is dealing with depression.

747
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,320
She's not in a good mood.

748
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,360
It's not just you.

749
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,919
She's even worse with her own parents.

750
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,320
I've seen it firsthand.

751
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,560
I get it, I do,

752
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:10,199
but I still feel

753
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,520
so annoyed.

754
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,959
Mom, isn't that what the bracelet is for?

755
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,840
I've already paid for that.

756
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,520
Please be more patient.

757
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,239
I know,

758
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,320
when she's discharged,

759
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,399
I'll get you an even bigger one.

760
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,800
It would be so heavy

761
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,560
that you wouldn't be able

762
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,120
to lift your hand.

763
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:27,679
You brat,

764
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,719
always know how to make me smile.

765
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,199
Tell me.

766
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,399
Tell you what?

767
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,520
How to take care of your dad.

768
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,280
And how to manage the housework.

769
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,679
Your Dad's getting out of
the hospital in a few days.

770
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,639
Do I look like someone

771
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,080
who's cut out for housework?

772
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,800
I forgot.

773
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,719
That's one thing you got from me,

774
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,280
marrying a good husband.

775
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,560
So, you're asking the wrong person.

776
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,600
You should be asking Li Lin.

777
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,679
Come on.

778
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,800
How can I

779
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,959
ask my son-in-law

780
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,560
about this stuff?

781
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,320
Didn't I already ask Lanxiang

782
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,919
to come over and help?

783
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,560
That's not the same.

784
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,600
I'm taking care of my husband.

785
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,000
Let me tell you,

786
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,679
looking after your dad is my job,

787
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,479
not even you or Xin can step in.

788
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,520
But I feel,

789
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:23,639
over the years,

790
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,760
I've been so spoiled by your dad.

791
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:31,320
I remember back when I lost my job,

792
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,679
I was only 40.

793
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:34,919
You were 15 then,

794
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:35,919
and Xin was eight.

795
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,679
It felt like my whole world
was collapsing.

796
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,280
Do you know how your dad
got through that?

797
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,479
Every morning, he got up early,

798
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,360
made breakfast for the three of us,

799
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,399
and then took me out
to run our fried chicken stall.

800
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,360
He wouldn't let me do a thing,

801
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,199
just collect the money.

802
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,719
After we called it a day,

803
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,919
he'd go to

804
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,120
a restaurant

805
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,399
and worked as a cook.

806
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,520
Back then, I felt like

807
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,600
there was hope in life again.

808
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,800
To me,

809
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,479
your dad was my whole world.

810
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,679
But now, that world has crumbled again.

811
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,120
So I think

812
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,080
I need to be brave this time.

813
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:22,320
It's a bit late, huh?

814
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,280
But maybe it's not too late.

815
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,199
It's not too late.

816
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,080
You've got this, Mom.

817
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,399
You have my full support.

818
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,360
Really?

819
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,000
You know what?

820
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,280
In the ward,

821
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,679
your dad's the one

822
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:34,280
recovering the fastest.

823
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:35,439
He says,

824
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,120
just thinking about the baby you're carrying

825
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,800
and Xin's

826
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,159
new born daughter

827
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,719
makes him feel hopeful.

828
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,320
I think once he's back home,

829
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,639
with me taking care of him,

830
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:46,159
he'll get even better.

831
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,199
With you looking after him,

832
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,560
he's bound to be just fine.

833
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:52,320
An,

834
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,479
I really love talking with you.

835
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,040
It feels like I've raised

836
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,280
a grown son.

837
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,560
You not only make me proud,

838
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,399
you also give me strength.

839
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,159
Why do I feel like I've

840
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,679
had another daughter?

841
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,320
Nonsense.

842
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,600
I'm your mom.

843
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,879
Look at you.

844
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:16,320
Come on, cheer up.

845
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,199
Good.

846
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:20,679
Here.

847
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,000
Tasty, right?

848
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,280
Yeah, it's delicious.

849
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Then have some more.

850
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
You're so considerate.

851
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,199
Of course.

852
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,800
If you like it,

853
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,719
just let me know anytime.

854
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:43,280
I'm your best delivery guy.

855
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,399
Try this.

856
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:53,280
What is it?

857
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,479
You done eating?

858
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,479
Did Xu Meng'an send you?

859
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
I knew it.

860
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,239
These flavors

861
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,479
are all her favorites.

862
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,199
Where is she?

863
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,919
Why doesn't she come here herself?

864
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,280
Would she dare?

865
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,719
What wouldn't she dare?

866
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,120
She has even got guts

867
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,800
to make decisions for others.

868
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,959
No, this time it's different.

869
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,320
This is the first time I've seen her

870
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,600
look so pitiful,

871
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,719
almost desperate,

872
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
even pleading with me to come
and talk to you.

873
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,719
I don't believe it.

874
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,280
It's true, really!

875
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,800
You should've seen her.

876
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,639
She grabbed my hands,

877
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,199
tears in her eyes,

878
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,000
looked so pitiful,

879
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,560
and almost knelt in front of me.

880
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:40,600
She said

881
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,080
she's so afraid of seeing you right now.

882
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,040
When she came to see you that day,

883
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,199
you could see it in her eyes.

884
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:44,959
Literally.

885
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,399
She was scared and nervous.

886
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:49,239
I,

887
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,320
I should've recorded her then,

888
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,879
so you could see it.

889
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,399
You'd have enjoyed it for sure.

890
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,879
Just thinking about it now makes me laugh.

891
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:57,600
Feels good, huh?

892
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,120
So satisfying.

893
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,040
Exactly, satisfying.

894
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,479
As long as you're happy.

895
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,840
Don't be fooled by

896
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,959
your sister's tough facade,

897
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,120
but actually,

898
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,520
she's really scared.

899
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,520
The pressure is really getting to her.

900
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,719
When she pushed Haowen to sign,

901
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
she was just really desperate.

902
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,239
If something happened to the baby,

903
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,239
both you and the child

904
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,320
would be in danger.

905
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
I know, I really do.

906
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,000
I just can't get past it.

907
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,080
Yeah, I understand.

908
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,080
Xin, don't overthink it.

909
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,520
Look at you now, you're doing great.

910
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,120
You had a son and a daughter, and you're healthy.

911
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,320
You're in the recovery period.

912
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Once you're fully healed,

913
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,520
you can have

914
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,000
your sister

915
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,560
put on another show for you.

916
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Tell her to make it really pathetic this time.

917
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,760
Right, right, really pathetic.

918
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,560
It's hard to imagine

919
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,679
my sister acting like this.

920
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,040
She does care about you, though.

921
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
If you like it, I'll have her
make more for you.

922
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,199
She made this?

923
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:05,760
Oops, slipped.

924
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,320
I knew it.

925
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,320
All these are

926
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
her favorite flavors.

927
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,520
She spent all morning on it.

928
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,279
This is her best effort?

929
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:16,880
It's pretty bad.

930
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,960
Yeah, exactly.

931
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,400
Wanna try it?

932
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,279
I already did.

933
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,719
This one doesn't look great.

934
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,799
But it tastes alright.

935
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,679
She knows

936
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,400
something about fashion design.

937
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Where's her sense of aesthetics?

938
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,440
Seriously.

939
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,920
I'll talk to her later.

940
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,000
So you're not mad anymore?

941
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,960
That depends.

942
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,679
Show me how she begged you.

943
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,920
Give me that

944
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,480
pathetic look.

945
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,400
Please, Wanzhen, just go.

946
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,839
Why did you agree

947
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:44,600
so quickly?

948
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,679
You should've let her try harder.

949
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,880
I couldn't take it anymore.

950
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,359
Why are you still here

951
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,520
working so hard by yourself?

952
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,799
Didn't you say you would

953
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,319
train the new hires and build teams?

954
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:11,000
It's not too much trouble.

955
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,080
If I left it to them,

956
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,120
it'd take half a day,

957
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,600
while I can get it done

958
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,719
in half an hour.

959
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
They say in our media industry,

960
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,880
women work like men,

961
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,159
and men work like machines.

962
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,400
But you,

963
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,359
treat yourself like

964
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,960
a workhorse machine.

965
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:26,719
Are you here to cheer me on?

966
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:28,440
Stop joking.

967
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,000
Sit up straight.

968
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:31,400
Head up, chest out.

969
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Hold out your hand.

970
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,600
What for?

971
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,239
To receive the decree.

972
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,880
What decree?

973
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,080
Take a look.

974
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,880
An invitation?

975
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,560
Top 10 Influential Women Awards?

976
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,480
I got this for you.

977
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,560
What is it?

978
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,719
An award ceremony, of course.

979
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,199
When is it held?

980
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,159
This Sunday.

981
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,199
This Sunday?

982
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,520
I can't make it.

983
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,000
But I've got a client meeting on Sunday.

984
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,040
I think I'll skip it.

985
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,520
Why waste time on this flashy stuff?

986
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,480
I'd rather get more business

987
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,319
for the company.

988
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,920
Yeah, work needs to be done and done well,

989
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,600
reputation matters too.

990
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,319
If you're planning to step back,

991
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:11,040
you need to keep your name out there.

992
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,000
Make sure Mr. Zhang

993
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,679
realizes

994
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,239
your place in the industry.

995
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:16,719
Work is the obvious front,

996
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,239
but this is also the battlefield.

997
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,159
When it's time for your comeback,

998
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,520
this will be your leverage.

999
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:23,679
You know how much effort it took

1000
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,920
to get you this award?

1001
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,279
Did you pull strings?

1002
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:27,799
Why would I need to?

1003
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,639
You have to go.

1004
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll go.

1005
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,719
Alright, everyone, raise your glasses.

1006
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,679
Congrats to Feifei for closing another deal!

1007
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,400
Congrats! Cheers!

1008
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,400
Thank you.

1009
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,799
As for the big invite event tomorrow,

1010
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,239
keep up the good work, everyone!

1011
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:57,960
Cheers!

1012
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,440
Cheers!

1013
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,759
Cheers!

1014
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,799
You have to work hard.

1015
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:01,600
We'll.

1016
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:05,719
Our department's wealthy lady

1017
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,759
really knows how to kill the vibe.

1018
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:09,120
But even without closing deals,

1019
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,520
she still rides in luxury cars

1020
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:11,759
and lives in fancy houses.

1021
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,199
We're not like her.

1022
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,920
We have to hustle, got it?

1023
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:15,639
Yes.

1024
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:16,319
Alright, alright,

1025
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,080
don't let her ruin our mood.

1026
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:18,520
Come on.

1027
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:19,719
Let's drink!

1028
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,759
Cheers! Cheers!

1029
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,839
Guys, take a bite before it gets cold.

1030
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,520
Hurry up, try some.

1031
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,000
Okay.

1032
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,480
Oh, right,

1033
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:29,279
Mr. Qian,

1034
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,759
I need to toast to you personally.

1035
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,440
Without your help,

1036
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,880
I wouldn't have done so well.

1037
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,920
Cheers, Feifei.

1038
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:36,960
Keep it that way.

1039
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:38,040
Thanks, Mr. Qian.

1040
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,000
Okay, give me one.

1041
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,120
Congrats to Meng'an,

1042
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,799
for being nominated for a major award.

1043
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,199
Congrats, Ms. Xu.

1044
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,080
This honor belongs not only Ms. Xu,

1045
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,799
but also our entire company.

1046
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,359
Everyone, let's give her a big hand!

1047
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:40,839
Great!

1048
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:41,440
Applause!

1049
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,359
Nice.

1050
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:52,759
Come in.

1051
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:56,000
Mr. Qian.

1052
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,040
Yes?

1053
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,279
When am I getting

1054
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:03,239
my share of the commission?

1055
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,880
Chen Wanzhen,

1056
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,799
you planning to quit?

1057
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,679
Yes, I am,

1058
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,759
But

1059
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
I'm not leaving

1060
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,040
until I get my full commission.

1061
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,719
Chen Wanzhen, you're really something.

1062
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,880
You schemed your way

1063
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
into our sales department,

1064
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,159
worked for a few months,
and now you want to leave,

1065
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,279
with full commission?

1066
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,440
Are you being

1067
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,920
a housewife for so long

1068
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,639
that you think

1069
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,400
the world revolves around you?

1070
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Is that it?

1071
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,080
Mr. Qian,

1072
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:32,279
take a look at this report.

1073
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:46,880
Chen Wanzhen,

1074
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,960
where did you get these documents?

1075
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,400
This is internal information.

1076
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,279
You know I could charge you with theft

1077
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:52,560
and put you in jail, right?

1078
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,719
Mr. Qian,

1079
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,239
this is all publicly available data

1080
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,639
from various financial institutions,

1081
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,279
including our company's figures,

1082
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,880
in the annual reports.

1083
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,040
I simply

1084
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,279
compiled and analyzed them.

1085
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,679
And finally I drew my own conclusions.

1086
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,159
These are just my personal opinions.

1087
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,839
As for my resignation letter

1088
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,480
and commission request,

1089
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,000
I've already submitted them to headquarters.

1090
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,480
Please approve them at your earliest convenience.

1091
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,199
Thank you, Mr. Qian,

1092
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,960
for your help during this time.

1093
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:17,600
You can take a close look

1094
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:18,799
at this report if you like.

1095
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,759
Congratulations, Ms. Xu!

1096
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,279
Thanks.

1097
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:47,639
Get in there.

1098
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,400
What are you doing?

1099
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,719
Promoting.

1100
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,400
Didn't you put up some in the restroom?

1101
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,040
Thanks for the reminder.

1102
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,400
I'll get it done

1103
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,239
right away.

1104
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,880
Come on,

1105
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,000
what kind of promotion is this?

1106
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,759
That's a flattery trap, you know?

1107
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,639
Aren't you working in new media?

1108
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,279
Don't you know the art of marketing?

1109
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,279
I don't need you

1110
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:08,520
to school me on business.

1111
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:08,880
Not a chance.

1112
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,880
You might forget it.

1113
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
So I need to remind you.

1114
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,960
You need to anchor

1115
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,679
the audience's minds.

1116
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,560
Anchor who?

1117
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,639
Our company.

1118
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,400
Right now,

1119
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,040
you're the anchor for the company's image.

1120
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,000
Can we just drop this?

1121
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,319
You're making this such a big deal of it,

1122
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,400
but is anyone benefiting?

1123
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
You are.

1124
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,759
How's this possible?

1125
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:29,799
Dear,

1126
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,359
I'm pregnant now,

1127
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,719
I need to work hard
and keep a low profile.

1128
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:36,000
I wish

1129
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,400
I could just

1130
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,839
have this baby

1131
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:38,799
before anyone notices,

1132
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:39,719
take the maternity leave,

1133
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,000
and slip back into work.

1134
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,520
But if you make me the anchor,

1135
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,799
everyone will be watching me!

1136
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,199
How am I supposed to take time off?

1137
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,040
Hiding won't help.

1138
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:48,839
How come?

1139
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,199
Besides,

1140
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,279
it's just a nomination.

1141
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,440
I haven't actually won it yet.

1142
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:53,799
And what if I don't win?

1143
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,040
We'll just pretend nothing ever happens?

1144
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,719
What I'm doing here

1145
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,799
has nothing to do with
you winning or not.

1146
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,199
I'm doing all this

1147
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:01,159
just because you're pregnant.

1148
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,400
Come with me.

1149
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,679
Look.

1150
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,400
Xu Meng'an,

1151
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:10,920
Chief Content Officer of Xinmiao Media.

1152
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,080
Once honored,

1153
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,120
Top 10 Leaders

1154
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,799
in Chunjiang City's Integrated Media.

1155
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,400
Outstanding Talent

1156
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,719
in Chunjiang City's Online Audio-Visual Industry.

1157
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,000
Anyone who looks at this poster

1158
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,880
will see those lines.

1159
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,799
I want to make sure

1160
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:27,639
that Mr. Zhang and everyone at the company

1161
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:28,600
gets the message

1162
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,480
behind these lines,

1163
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,679
that you, Xu Meng'an, are truly exceptional.

1164
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,920
When it comes to real talent,

1165
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,679
we don't need to

1166
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,639
play games

1167
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,440
or tricks.

1168
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,679
Don't you want to

1169
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,560
lower your profile?

1170
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,199
Well,

1171
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:41,560
nobody is focused on your pregnancy now.

1172
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,799
I want everyone in this company

1173
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,520
to always live in

1174
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,759
your shadow.

1175
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,960
Why don't you just make sure

1176
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,159
I live in their minds forever?

1177
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,960
Then I have to put a frame around it.

1178
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,920
Thanks.

1179
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,359
But how about something more practical?

1180
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:03,799
How about a boyfriend?

1181
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,400
I'd love that.
