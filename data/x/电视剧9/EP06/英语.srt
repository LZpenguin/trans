00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,020
Just in Time EP06

3
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,350
So now your main task is just

4
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,880
picking up the kids and buying groceries.

5
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,470
No.

6
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:58,990
No.

7
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,270
I'm still out on marketing

8
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,160
occasionally.

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm still at

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,120
the research institute.

11
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
You're facing challenges, aren't you?

12
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,160
Right?

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,680
Or bottleneck as they say it?

14
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,270
It's like you can't move forward.

15
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,960
You got stuck like here.

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Right? Isn't that what it means?

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,680
The road...

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,430
The route to science is endless.

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
Having a bottleneck is a good thing.

20
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,830
Overcoming challenges

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,640
leads to new goals.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,400
Can you talk to me about this?

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,240
About what?

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,310
The bottleneck.

25
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,750
Not at all.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,680
Our business

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,830
is flourishing now.

28
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,680
Everything's good.

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,360
A thing

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,960
is researched,

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,640
isn't it?

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,520
It doesn't happen right away.

33
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,120
It takes a long time.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,270
Even up to two or,

35
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,960
five years,

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,550
or possibly over ten years.

37
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,080
That means,

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,520
it could take ten years to discover something.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,920
Wouldn't you starve to death by then?

40
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,150
What kind of team

41
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,150
is this?

42
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,990
Hey,

43
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,960
why are you always absent-minded?

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Even so in a chess.

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,960
I'm not zoning out.

46
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,480
I'm just contemplating.

47
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,710
Last time

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,430
when you helped me clean the pool,

49
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,030
I saw you

50
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,400
holding the tap,

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,310
not even turning it on.

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,430
You were absent-minded, weren't you?

53
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,080
I...

54
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,480
That's called clearing the mind,

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,830
a form of meditation.

56
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,960
Again?

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,400
I wasn't.

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,520
I wasn't thinking.

59
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,990
Actually, if there's anything,

60
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,150
just say it.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,750
Remember, I'm your father-in-law.

62
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,830
You're not an outsider.

63
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,920
We're all family here.

64
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,680
If there's anything,

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,030
don't keep it on your mind .

66
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,830
If you can talk about it, then speak up.

67
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,590
We'll help in the best way we can.

68
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,310
Everyone has pressure

69
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
to live these days.

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Everyone is busy.

71
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
It's not easy for anyone.

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,710
It's your turn.

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,120
Dad,

74
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,800
don't worry.

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,310
I'm fine.

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
If there's anything,

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
I won't keep it inside.

78
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,270
I'll tell you.

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,640
Yes.

80
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,400
Even though I'm not your dad,

81
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm still your father-in-law.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,870
Right?

83
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,520
Let me tell you, Li Lin,

84
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,430
I don't have a son,

85
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,270
but ever since

86
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,310
you

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,120
married An,

88
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,510
do you know how I see you?

89
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,950
As a saying goes in the Northeast,

90
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,600
a son-in-law is like half a son.

91
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,680
But I

92
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,800
see you as a son.

93
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,190
I treat you like my own son.

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
You're also a father to me.

95
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,120
Abortion surgery harms your health.

96
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,950
Even if it's a miscarriage,

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
You need to rest for at least

98
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,310
one or two weeks.

99
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,870
At your age, you still need to be careful.

100
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,070
Get some good rest and don't fall ill.

101
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,920
Mr. Zhang.

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,280
How did it go?

103
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,510
It went smoothly.

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,510
Mr. Xiao is quite pleased

105
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,310
with the new marketing plan.

106
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,920
Anyway, I provided

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,190
all the available resources for him.

108
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,800
Keep the client for now.

109
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,870
How could you tell

110
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,600
them the least price?

111
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,750
How much are we losing?

112
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,070
Mr. Zhou is still calculating over there.

113
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,630
Alright,

114
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,950
just tell me the remedial plan.

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
I'll handle this project myself.

116
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,510
Then,

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,920
I'll go after two more clients.

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
You let me wait...?

119
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,390
Alright.

120
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,390
Finish these two cases

121
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,160
first.

122
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,160
Let me tell you,

123
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,750
we'll have wriggle room if you make it.

124
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,280
If not,

125
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,390
forget about next month's

126
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,430
salary and bonuses.

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,310
We'll all go down together.

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,360
Your house,

129
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,280
when will it be completed?

130
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,160
My house

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,950
won't be ready for another six months.

132
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,990
Well, six months

133
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,360
will pass in the blink of an eye.

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Right now,

135
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,920
you should make some time

136
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,720
to visit the building materials market.

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,750
Take a look around.

138
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,390
You need to plan carefully.

139
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,990
Once you've decided,

140
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,040
you should quickly check out

141
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,680
the decoration materials.

142
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,870
Sure, sure, sure.

143
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,720
Think about it,

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,430
in one's lifetime,

145
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,510
how many houses can one buy?

146
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,310
Once you buy it, you'll live there forever,

147
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,120
right?

148
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,510
Not just your lifetime,

149
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,550
your kids in the future,

150
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,680
they'll live there too.

151
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
Hey, I'm talking to you!

152
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
Also, during the decoration,

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
you and An should

154
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,720
discuss more.

155
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:00,990
Dad,

156
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,390
you're right.

157
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,160
That's what we were thinking.

158
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,190
Once we get the house,

159
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,430
Meng'an and I won't rush into decorating.

160
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,510
We'll wait

161
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,550
until we're sure about everything

162
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,630
and make decisions,

163
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,920
then we'll start the work.

164
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,840
I'll go wash it now.

165
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,680
You sit and have some tea.

166
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,990
Does it look good?

167
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,190
It looks beautiful.

168
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
But isn't it too warm?

169
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,390
For the sake of beauty,

170
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,680
I'll endure it.

171
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,630
It's fashion, you know?

172
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,390
Mom,

173
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:55,750
are you okay?

174
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,160
You're back.

175
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,870
Dad told me

176
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,600
that you weren't feeling fine

177
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,390
and even went to the hospital.

178
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,430
Who went to the hospital?

179
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,600
What's wrong?

180
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,480
Dad said

181
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,840
mom might be in menopause.

182
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,390
Are you really going through menopause?

183
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,800
No.

184
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
I just went to the hospital

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,190
to get some vitamins.

186
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
Don't listen to your dad's nonsense.

187
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,750
It was a false alarm.

188
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,680
I mean,

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
if you really were in menopause,

190
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
I would try not to upset you.

191
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,870
You better not upset me anyway.

192
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,310
Menopause or not, I'm having a mood swing.

193
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,390
So, are you or aren't you?

194
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,550
None of your business.

195
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,920
You're my sister or what?

196
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,720
Where's dad?

197
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,160
He's in the kitchen with Li Lin.

198
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,990
I'll go say hi.

199
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:40,990
Dad.

200
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Is she really in menopause?

201
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,270
Impossible. She's not that age yet.

202
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,840
Yunjie,

203
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,870
try not to bother your mom too much.

204
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,990
Today, she came in with such

205
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,120
a bad temper,

206
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,200
like she's in menopause.

207
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:01,990
Dad.

208
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,600
You're back.

209
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,240
Why didn't I see Haowen?

210
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,240
He said he has a meeting.

211
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,960
He'll be back later.

212
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,200
Do you need help?

213
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:08,960
No.

214
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,150
Why did you tell the kid

215
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,150
that I'm going through menopause?

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,270
Li Lin,

217
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,270
let it soak for a bit longer

218
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,240
and spit out the sand,

219
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
then I'll cook it.

220
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:20,990
Alright.

221
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,630
Menopause

222
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,150
isn't shameful, is it?

223
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,870
What's wrong?

224
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,790
Before you come over,

225
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,960
go home first,

226
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,840
and bring all the new things I bought

227
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,150
that are yet to be opened.

228
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,120
Bring as much

229
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,390
as you can.

230
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,150
What for?

231
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,960
I'll explain later.

232
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,840
Okay, got it.

233
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,240
Take it.

234
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,510
What for?

235
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,390
Your mom asked me to give this to you.

236
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,870
I'm too old to spend your money.

237
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,840
No matter how old you are,

238
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,320
you are a child of us.

239
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,910
Your mom said,

240
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,990
if you have money in your pocket,

241
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,030
you won't panic.

242
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,600
Take it.

243
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,360
Take it.

244
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,150
The password is your mom's birthday.

245
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,960
You know it.

246
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,630
Dad.

247
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,390
Dad, everything is washed.

248
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,720
Just waiting for you to start cooking.

249
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,870
Okay, okay, I'll cook.

250
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,510
Upset?

251
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,510
What I meant was

252
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,390
it's possible.

253
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,440
This...

254
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,600
This is...

255
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,120
From dad.

256
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
You should keep it.

257
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
You're getting a bit gloomy, huh?

258
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,120
It's not that serious, right?

259
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,270
It's not that big of a deal.

260
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,200
Just feel a bit ashamed.

261
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,560
Who is feeling ashamed?

262
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,910
You feel ashamed?

263
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,320
Then I'd be

264
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,720
a lot more shamed long ago.

265
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,960
What do you mean?

266
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,320
Back when Haowen and I

267
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,150
were starting our business,

268
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,320
mom gave me money too.

269
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,360
You didn't know that, right?

270
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,790
Back then,

271
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,750
mom was afraid you'd think she was biased.

272
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,790
I just didn't tell you.

273
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,030
When did this happen?

274
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,480
When Haowen and I

275
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,150
were at Sijiqing.

276
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,240
Someone wanted to sell their stall,

277
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,630
and we wanted to buy it but didn't have enough money.

278
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,910
Mom gave it to us.

279
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,510
Back then, when I took money from mom and dad,

280
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,910
it wasn't like how you are now.

281
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,600
You guys were so young back then.

282
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,360
Li Lin and I at this age,

283
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,480
we still don't know

284
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,560
when we can pay it back.

285
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,150
Why do you need to pay it back?

286
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,870
Why are you thinking like Haowen?

287
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,870
I told Haowen back then,

288
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
when we didn't have money,

289
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,750
we took from mom and dad

290
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,510
like it was our own.

291
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,600
When we have money,

292
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,670
spending on mom and dad

293
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,670
should be more generous

294
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,990
than spending on ourselves.

295
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,960
That's why you decorated mom and dad's house like this?

296
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,480
Exactly.

297
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,910
We're family, after all.

298
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,320
But your mindset now,

299
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,320
is like you don't consider us as family.

300
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,560
Sister, you need to think long-term.

301
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,560
Mom and dad are doing great.

302
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,720
At least

303
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,750
they have another twenty to thirty years to go, right?

304
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,990
You can't just think about paying back the money,

305
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
you also have to fulfill your filial duties.

306
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Am I right?

307
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,600
I thought you were hugging me.

308
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,150
You have no manners at all.

309
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,990
Coming, coming.

310
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,030
Sister, take this.

311
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,440
Is there more food?

312
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,990
Yes, yes.

313
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,390
Li Lin made a lot.

314
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,870
The oysters are really fresh today.

315
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,390
Mom.

316
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,600
If you want to sell the car,

317
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,030
I can recommend

318
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,120
a used car website for you.

319
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,630
You can sell it for more than

320
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,560
what you'd get at a used car market.

321
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,870
We're not selling the car anymore.

322
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,720
We'll keep driving this car

323
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,630
to take you to school from now on.

324
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,200
Really?

325
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,600
Dad!

326
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,150
Did you find a job?

327
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

328
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,120
I was worried about you!

329
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,080
Thinking the car would be sold,

330
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,750
and then how would I explain

331
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,840
it to He Lu and the others?

332
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,960
Now it's fine,

333
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,030
I can shop for other things.

334
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:01,750
Yunjie,

335
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,240
you and your mom come out first.

336
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,030
I'll go park the car.

337
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,120
Wait a minute,

338
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
there's something from my aunt in the trunk.

339
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,840
A gift from her?

340
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,790
All these are gifts from aunt.

341
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,510
So many.

342
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
Where did that pair of sneakers go?

343
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,870
Later, with all these things,

344
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,360
I'll take as much as I can carry.

345
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,390
I can't carry everything,

346
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,440
so I'll leave the rest to you two.

347
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay.

348
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,320
Honey.

349
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,560
What's up?

350
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,320
You know,

351
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,840
today we...

352
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
We're giving gifts to my sister

353
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,230
at such a sensitive time.

354
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,870
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

355
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,000
Honey,

356
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,040
we didn't know

357
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,710
about her situation, right?

358
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,600
Now that we know, we should give even more.

359
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm telling you,

360
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,360
Yunjie's food, drinks, necessities, clothes,

361
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,390
are all covered.

362
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,520
You don't understand my sister.

363
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,670
My sister has a strong sense of pride.

364
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,600
Just today,

365
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,950
when we had mom and dad give her the money,

366
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,150
it almost got rejected.

367
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,800
My sister has been working part-time

368
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,080
to support herself since college.

369
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,320
Asking family for money

370
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,360
would

371
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,870
really hurt her.

372
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,870
Then we have to help her get used to it,

373
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,910
because family shouldn't stand on ceremony.

374
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,710
Why should she feel embarrassed

375
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,800
to ask her own family for help?

376
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,630
From now on, her matters

377
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,710
are our matters.

378
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm telling you,

379
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,710
tomorrow I'll give my brother-in-law

380
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,360
more gifts.

381
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,190
Enough, enough, enough.

382
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,080
Even my sister didn't accept it.

383
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
With his pride, would he accept it?

384
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,520
He's thin-skinned.

385
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm thick-skinned.

386
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,520
I don't care.

387
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,280
In this world,

388
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
there's no gift that Jia Haowen

389
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,520
can't give away.

390
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,710
Let me tell you,

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,950
gift-giving is an art.

392
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,000
You're quite an artist, huh?

393
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,600
Where's mine?

394
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,710
What?

395
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,150
It's on the way.

396
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,630
I've got a surprise for you.

397
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,040
Come back!

398
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,520
What is it? Tell me quickly,

399
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,320
or I won't be able to sleep tonight.

400
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,390
Miss Xu Mengxin,

401
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,520
please open your phone

402
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,000
and check your shopping cart.

403
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,870
Surprised?

404
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,080
Isn't it unexpected?

405
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,630
As expected.

406
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,470
Watching Chang'e?

407
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,670
Watching the stars.

408
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,630
Let me tell you,

409
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,910
today, when you asked me to give that...

410
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,000
that card

411
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,230
to the eldest, right?

412
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,430
You know what I was thinking before that?

413
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,910
What were you thinking?

414
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,190
I was thinking,

415
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,040
with her personality,

416
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,560
she wouldn't want it.

417
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,040
She'd definitely

418
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,470
argue with me.

419
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,230
You know?

420
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,230
I even thought,

421
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,710
how could I convince her?

422
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,280
But I didn't expect that

423
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,470
when I took out the card,

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,800
I said,

425
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,320
"Your mom asked me to give this to you."

426
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,230
What did she say?

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,630
She didn't say anything.

428
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,320
I just grabbed her hand back,

429
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,430
holding it in mine, saying

430
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,670
"Take it.

431
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,150
The password is your mom's birthday."

432
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,190
I then

433
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,430
closed her hand.

434
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,040
When I looked up,

435
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,230
she was crying.

436
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,230
This means something serious is going on.

437
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,000
Otherwise,

438
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,430
she wouldn't have taken the money.

439
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,190
Then I started thinking about Li Lin.

440
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,000
He's not like going to work.

441
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,870
He gets up in the morning...

442
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,870
It's not Sunday.

443
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,710
It's not Saturday either.

444
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,760
How could he go buy groceries?

445
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,630
And also buy those

446
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,670
discounted eggs.

447
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,190
Yes, yes.

448
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,470
I ran into him.

449
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,280
Didn't I tell you?

450
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,470
Yes, you told me.

451
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,430
Why isn't he at work?

452
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,120
Maybe something happened

453
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,630
at his company, right?

454
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,670
Perhaps,

455
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,840
just like in that comedy sketch,

456
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,320
he got "gloriously laid off."

457
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
Could that be possible?

458
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
What should we do?

459
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,600
Yeah.

460
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,390
Just think about how much this weighs on him

461
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,120
right now.

462
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,950
How big a deal it must be

463
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,840
to get him like this.

464
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,230
She is just same as him.

465
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,190
They won't talk about anything.

466
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,670
You know,

467
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,040
this eldest one,

468
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,120
she is so strong-willed.

469
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,080
And Li Lin, being a researcher,

470
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,630
is so single-minded, you know?

471
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,560
I'm just thinking,

472
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,670
how to properly talk to him.

473
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,520
I just thought of something.

474
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,600
What is it?

475
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,000
Actually, it wasn't my idea.

476
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,470
I saw it on my phone.

477
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,910
It says,

478
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,040
"Don't be a..."

479
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,520
How does it go again?

480
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,630
Let me think...

481
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,040
Don't...

482
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,470
Don't be a...

483
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,840
highly educated fool.

484
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,430
No, isn't that an insult?

485
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,150
No, see, you're just at primary level.

486
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,230
How is that an insult?

487
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,190
What I mean is,

488
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,390
a person shouldn't study too much,

489
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,950
or they'll become foolish.

490
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,280
That's what I mean.

491
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,040
I think this saying

492
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,390
suits him perfectly now.

493
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,150
He's just read too many books.

494
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,390
I'm afraid he won't figure it out,

495
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,150
you know?

496
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,390
If he's depressed all day,

497
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,560
he might get sick.

498
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,040
What if there's something wrong here,

499
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,150
and something wrong there?

500
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,760
What would we do about our eldest then?

501
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,600
Then you should go talk to him quickly!

502
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,430
Do you think if I say this...

503
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,120
Is it okay?

504
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,600
Yeah.

505
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,320
Okay, okay.

506
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,600
He won't understand like you do, right?

507
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,280
Thinking I'm insulting him.

508
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,520
Well, there aren't many like me, you know.

509
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,840
Okay.

510
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,230
Tomorrow when I go to work,

511
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,840
this plan

512
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,760
must be on

513
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,670
my desk.

514
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,320
Alright?

515
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,040
Come on, come on, come on!

516
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Let's all work hard together!

517
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,040
As for your job,

518
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,230
just quit it.

519
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,870
We don't need your small income.

520
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
This is the divorce agreement

521
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,950
drafted by my lawyer.

522
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,710
Take a look.

523
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,870
Don't scare me!

524
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,230
I'm not scaring you.

525
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,600
I've made up my mind.

526
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,430
I'm definitely

527
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,390
getting a divorce.

528
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,040
No,

529
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,230
is it necessary?

530
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,080
Do we really need

531
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,630
to go as far as getting a divorce?

532
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,670
Do you think our marriage

533
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,520
still have a reason to exist?

534
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Of course it does.

535
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,520
Our child is only eight years old.

536
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,120
Yes,

537
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,560
I work outside every day,

538
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,870
and I rarely come home.

539
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,320
But you wouldn't think

540
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,040
I have something going on outside, right?

541
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,710
Do I have anything going on outside?

542
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:36,760
This...

543
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,870
Where did this come from?

544
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,040
You don't need to know that.

545
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:42,870
You men,

546
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,080
are you all like this?

547
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,080
Don't shed tears until you see the coffin.

548
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,280
No, Wanzhen, I...

549
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,630
I, I, I swear to you,

550
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,670
I absolutely did nothing wrong to you,

551
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,040
or to

552
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,360
this family of ours.

553
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,520
You know, in the business world,

554
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,800
sometimes,

555
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,080
there are men and women,

556
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,710
it's just playing along, right?

557
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,040
Indeed, sometimes,

558
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,080
when I'm tired,

559
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,760
I also need

560
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,040
someone to take care of me, right?

561
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,320
Right?

562
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,280
But between me and her,

563
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,190
there is absolutely nothing

564
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,670
crossing the line.

565
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,560
This trust

566
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,910
should always exist between us, right?

567
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,910
Are you saying this is all a misunderstanding?

568
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,670
It's a coincidence

569
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,120
that it happened to be photographed, right?

570
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,390
No, look

571
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,230
at the environment...

572
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,800
This is a hotel I often stay in.

573
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,150
Men and women here

574
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,390
are so many.

575
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,390
When working overtime,

576
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,120
it's day and night

577
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,430
without fail, right?

578
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,910
If there's a woman

579
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,760
in my room

580
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,910
taking these kinds of photos,

581
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,950
you can't throw all this dirt

582
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,360
just on me, can you?

583
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,630
I'll sack her tomorrow.

584
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,870
Wanzhen.

585
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,430
I really didn't know.

586
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,520
I didn't know

587
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,760
you've endured so much.

588
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,470
Yu Hai,

589
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:25,840
you think by

590
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,230
sacking Miss Huang,

591
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,950
we can pretend

592
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,040
nothing happened

593
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,630
and live like before?

594
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,390
No, Wanzhen,

595
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,320
in my heart,

596
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,280
you have always been my wife.

597
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,000
I admit, I admit I was wrong.

598
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,040
Alright.

599
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,670
I was wrong, I was wrong.

600
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,430
I, I, I...

601
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,600
I became arrogant,

602
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,360
I became vain.

603
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,150
Sometimes, I even...

604
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,120
I enjoy having someone by my side.

605
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,040
But I'll change.

606
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,120
I swear on my health,

607
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,280
I, Yu Hai, have my limits.

608
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,670
I absolutely...

609
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,390
I know what you're going to say.

610
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,470
You have your limits.

611
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,630
You didn't physically cheat,

612
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,320
you just had a little

613
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,630
lapse emotionally.

614
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,910
That's what you mean, right?

615
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:12,800
Yu Hai,

616
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,910
I don't care who you are now.

617
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,230
I don't care at all.

618
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,320
And don't try to

619
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,800
save this marriage.

620
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,470
No, why?

621
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:19,950
Why?

622
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,910
Why do we have to

623
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,150
get a divorce?

624
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,560
Wanzhen, you weren't like this before.

625
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,870
You always considered the bigger picture.

626
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,840
You were so sensible.

627
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,710
You, divorce...

628
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,910
You still have to think about the child

629
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,470
and the elders, right?

630
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,280
I was just too sensible before,

631
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,710
too concerned about the bigger picture.

632
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,430
I've always compromised,

633
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,080
why can't I

634
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,600
have my own life?

635
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,430
Do I have to live

636
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,430
as Mrs. Yu?

637
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,430
I don't want

638
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,230
this identity anymore.

639
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,040
I want to be Chen Wanzhen again.

640
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,040
No, no, no, Wanzhen,

641
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,760
Wanzhen, Wanzhen, Wanzhen!

642
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Don't scare me like this.

643
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,870
We've been together

644
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,080
for ten years.

645
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,630
The child is only eight now,

646
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,360
right?

647
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,910
I'm busy outside every day,

648
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,950
and the house is entirely up to you.

649
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,230
You are my pillar of support.

650
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,520
Everything I have,

651
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,800
my home,

652
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,120
my career.

653
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,040
Everything I have

654
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,000
is tied together with yours.

655
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,560
Yes, I'm busy now,

656
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,600
and I rarely come home.

657
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,560
But don't think

658
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,630
that this makes our

659
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,950
relationship fade.

660
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,280
Don't let this be the reason

661
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,710
we split up, okay?

662
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,600
Is it...

663
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,430
because of the issue with mom?

664
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,040
But, between us,

665
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,710
there's always mutual responsibility, right?

666
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,040
Feelings are feelings,

667
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,230
marriage is marriage.

668
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,120
What I'm talking about

669
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,430
is the marriage itself.

670
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,430
I don't want to be trapped

671
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,230
in this marriage with you anymore.

672
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,870
I want to leave.

673
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,430
No, why should you?

674
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,950
Why you say leave

675
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,080
and we have to leave?

676
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,040
Moreover,

677
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,560
after you leave me,

678
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,230
how will you live?

679
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,320
Yu Hai, are you afraid that

680
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,520
I'll take your money?

681
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,080
No.

682
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,280
I'm afraid of you?

683
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,230
Afraid of you, what for?

684
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,840
I can earn money myself.

685
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,710
Even if I

686
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,600
give everything to you

687
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,430
and leave with nothing,

688
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,630
I can still

689
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,080
rise again,

690
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,840
okay?

691
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:05,910
Aren't you afraid

692
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,430
of the board and the shareholders?

693
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,040
No,

694
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,430
what do you really mean?

695
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,040
I've already discussed with the lawyer

696
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,080
about the divorce agreement.

697
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,040
If you sign,

698
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,150
I'll only take the house and savings.

699
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,520
I waive my share in the company

700
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,910
and the added value portion.

701
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,320
The company remains yours.

702
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,950
Your shareholders.

703
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,710
Your investors.

704
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,840
You can all rest reassured.

705
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,390
If you don't sign,

706
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,800
we'll see you in court.

707
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,800
You better think over it.

708
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,280
That is

709
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,430
Hongsheng Medical Equipment, right?

710
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,000
Yes.

711
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,710
Did you see the job posting?

712
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,870
I saw it online.

713
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,040
Right, right, I...

714
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,470
I'm a man.

715
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,470
If you still need someone,

716
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,520
give me a call, okay?

717
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,150
Who is it?

718
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,950
Hello, sir.

719
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,430
Your delivery has arrived.

720
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,600
I didn't order any delivery.

721
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,910
Isn't this

722
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,320
Room 502, Unit 2?

723
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,230
You got it wrong.

724
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,280
This is Unit 1.

725
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,430
Unit 2 is next door.

726
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Sorry, sorry.

727
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,950
I'm new here.

728
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,840
You...

729
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,470
are working with a child?

730
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,040
Her mother is in the neighboring complex.

731
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,760
Working as a housekeeper.

732
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,710
Sorry about that.

733
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,670
Sorry to disturb you.

734
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,800
Director Xu.

735
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,120
What are you eating?

736
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,670
Director Xu.

737
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,280
There's roast duck here.

738
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,230
Do you want some?

739
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,230
It's really delicious.

740
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,150
Have a piece.

741
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:49,360
Director Xu.

742
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,950
No, no.

743
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,080
You guys eat.

744
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,230
Hello, Director Xu.

745
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,910
Qianqian.

746
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,120
Your pork knuckle rice.

747
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,040
Thank you.

748
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,520
Here you go.

749
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,950
Want some, Director Xu?

750
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,120
Keep eating.

751
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,430
Come over, come over.

752
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,600
Let me tell you...

753
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,390
I spent two months gathering the courage.

754
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,630
Today, I finally decided

755
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,760
to eat a leek pie.

756
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,000
Come on, hurry up.

757
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,040
What's wrong?

758
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,120
What are you doing?

759
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,360
You got it all over my

760
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,470
leek pie!

761
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,470
Seriously!

762
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,360
Are you pregnant?

763
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,470
Really?

764
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,870
When did this happen?

765
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,870
How long has it been?

766
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,040
Is it a boy or a girl?

767
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,150
It's still just a tiny speck now.

768
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay?

769
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,630
Hurry up

770
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,520
and clean this up for me.

771
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,000
Clean it up.

772
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,390
Okay, okay, okay.

773
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,390
Li Lin, you did well.

774
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,840
What does this have to do with Li Lin?

775
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,280
How is it unrelated?

776
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,870
Without Li Lin, could you have gotten pregnant?

777
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,560
That's because I'm healthy, okay?

778
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,190
That's great!

779
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,670
Hurry up and give birth!

780
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,280
My future retirement

781
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,120
now has more security.

782
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,560
On behalf of all future elders,

783
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,390
thank you

784
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,150
for your great contribution

785
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,320
to society.

786
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,840
You're thanking me too soon.

787
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,390
I don't plan to give birth.

788
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,840
Why not?

789
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,760
Is it your business?

790
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,280
Don't be stubborn.

791
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,600
It's a good thing!

792
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,150
Is it because of the morning sickness?

793
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,800
From now on, no one in the company

794
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,080
is allowed to eat leek pies.

795
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,520
I'm telling you,

796
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,710
your morning sickness,

797
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,230
a while ago

798
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,630
you didn't have this reaction.

799
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,190
It's definitely because you got the good news,

800
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,000
you relaxed,

801
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,230
and that's why you have this reaction.

802
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,670
It's not a big deal.

803
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,080
Your work will pick up soon.

804
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,800
The morning sickness will be resolved easily.

805
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,150
Isn't that too much?

806
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,040
I came to you just to talk about

807
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,870
the leave of absence.

808
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,520
You really don't want it?

809
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,630
If it were you,

810
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,120
would you want it?

811
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,320
Yes, I would.

812
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,230
I haven't had one yet.

813
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,150
I mean a second child.

814
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,600
Second child.

815
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
You'd better help me calculate

816
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,630
how long I can take leave.

817
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,480
If you really don't want the child,

818
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,630
it's definitely not a matter of two or three days.

819
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,960
It would take at least a month or so.

820
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,120
I can calculate

821
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,270
how much leave you have,

822
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,710
but I can't approve it.

823
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,790
This matter

824
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,630
still needs to go to Zhang.

825
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,920
Success in certain fields,

826
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,710
one would think

827
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,080
is due to his diligence,

828
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,830
hard work, and struggle.

829
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,630
But does this explanation hold water?

830
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,560
We never said

831
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,830
effort is not important.

832
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,670
Because it's so important,

833
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,080
it's unnecessary to tell you.

834
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,120
Who doesn't work hard in China?

835
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,270
Who doesn't work hard in Shenzhen?

836
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,350
Who?

837
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,150
Who?

838
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,270
Sir,

839
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,120
would you like a wooden comb?

840
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Do you have one made of peach wood?

841
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,920
We're on the same side.

842
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,480
Hi Dad.

843
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,400
Were you

844
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,480
going fishing?

845
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,040
Why is it so dark in here?

846
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,400
Take off your glasses.

847
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,120
They all left.

848
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,600
Went to work.

849
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,520
Went to school.

850
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,560
Come with me.

851
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,830
What for?

852
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,830
Roast chicken.

853
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,630
Take the fishing rod.

854
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,310
Let's go.

855
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,230
Where are we going?

856
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,880
Fishing!

857
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,440
But you already have fish.

858
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,790
Bought from the market.

859
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,120
Come on, let's go, let's go.

860
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,000
Wait for me.

861
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,670
Very good.

862
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,230
I'm going to change my clothes.

863
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,000
Okay.

864
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,150
Dad.

865
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,080
I'm unemployed.

866
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,000
Shake hands.

867
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,120
Shake hands?

868
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,960
Come on.

869
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,830
Congratulations on being unemployed.

870
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,560
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations.

871
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,310
Congratulations?

872
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,440
Congratulations, congratulations.

873
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Who hasn't been unemployed?

874
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,710
I've been unemployed too.

875
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,960
Back then, your mom and I

876
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,270
were both unemployed together

877
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,440
when we were in the Northeast.

878
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,630
It's no big deal.

879
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,120
What's the big deal?

880
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,310
A few days ago, I came to fish.

881
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,040
That day, the fog was quite thick.

882
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,520
Then from the bridge over there,

883
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,600
a small boat came over.

884
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,480
When it got there,

885
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,520
I saw an old man

886
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,480
with a white beard,

887
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,960
wearing a bamboo hat

888
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,400
and a raincoat, fishing there.

889
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,710
I looked closely.

890
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,480
The old man had a fishing rod and a hook,

891
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,120
but the hook was straight.

892
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,040
Three feet above the water.

893
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,630
I said, fishing like this,

894
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,040
can you catch any fish?

895
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,120
The old man said,

896
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,080
you're fishing for fish.

897
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,150
I'm fishing for an opportunity.

898
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,120
I said, I often fish here.

899
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,480
Why have I never seen you?

900
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,750
I asked, what's your surname?

901
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,480
Surnamed Jiang.

902
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,670
It was at this moment...

903
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,920
Bang! I fell to the ground.

904
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,790
I woke up, you know?

905
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,080
No, no, no,

906
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,440
after that,

907
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,000
did he catch any opportunity?

908
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,400
This I know.

909
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,630
Jiang Taigong fishing: the willing bite the hook.

910
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,480
What does this mean exactly?

911
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,150
Dad.

912
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Before, I

913
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,190
didn't tell you

914
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,310
that I was unemployed

915
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,080
because I didn't want

916
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,040
to make you worry about this.

917
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,750
But I know, Dad,

918
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,080
what you both are thinking.

919
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,400
These past few days,

920
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,790
you've been beating around the bush.

921
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,600
I roughly understand now.

922
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,230
Opportunity

923
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,230
isn't just waiting there for me.

924
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,230
Opportunity

925
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,120
is something I have to create myself.

926
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,920
I understand.

927
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,040
Yes.

928
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,440
The ancients could wait for opportunities,

929
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,400
but you young people today,

930
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,080
you can't wait for opportunities.

931
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,120
You have to actively and diligently

932
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,630
seek out opportunities.

933
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,880
Is that what you mean?

934
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,630
Dad.

935
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,830
Today, now that I've said it, I

936
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,230
feel pretty good.

937
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,230
It's not just that you've been feeling unwell.

938
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,600
I too wasn't feeling good playing chess with you.

939
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,830
You kept spacing out every day.

940
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,440
I was just afraid you were getting sick, you know?

941
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,630
Son, you know?

942
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,350
Let me tell you.

943
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,920
If a door closes for you,

944
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,270
a window will open.

945
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
When I was laid off back then,

946
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,520
I kept telling myself,

947
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
I'm gold,

948
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
I will shine.

949
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,150
With that mindset,

950
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,190
your confidence

951
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,040
will grow stronger and stronger.

952
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,790
Right?

953
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,560
Back then, my grandfather

954
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,270
used to always tell me one thing:

955
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,830
When you succeed,

956
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
don't get too cocky.

957
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,000
When you don't succeed,

958
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,560
don't abandon yourself either.

959
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,670
Right?

960
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,040
If one path doesn't work out,

961
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,790
try another path.

962
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,040
You'll still see poetry and distant places.

963
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,230
Poetry and distant places.

964
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,520
I'm making a fool of myself.

965
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,000
But these words,

966
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,560
I've thought about them for several days.

967
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,400
You know?

968
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,480
For several days?

969
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,040
Right. It's got some depth, right?

970
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,230
Very deep.

971
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,080
Now I've had a sudden realization.

972
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,080
A sudden realization.

973
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,790
My son-in-law praises me...

974
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,350
You've got drinks?

975
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:44,790
I'm happy.

976
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,880
Let's celebrate.

977
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,880
Okay, let's celebrate this.

978
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,520
Looks like I brought the right wine today.

979
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,400
I originally wanted to drink a bit of sorrow wine with you,

980
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,920
but it turned into a celebratory drink.

981
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,750
Come on.

982
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,310
For poetry

983
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,270
and distant places.

984
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,520
Dad.

985
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,830
With you around,

986
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,790
it's really good.

987
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,440
In our position,

988
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,920
it seems like we need to travel at any time.

989
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,790
That's great!

990
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,270
While working,

991
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,310
you can also go out and explore.

992
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,310
Anyway, I'm not married.

993
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:04,670
I'm alone.

994
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,960
Who isn't?

995
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,560
I'm really sorry about this time.

996
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm really sorry about this time.

997
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
It's also quite a pity.

998
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,080
If next time we have

999
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,190
a better position and opportunity,

1000
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,600
we'll definitely contact you first.

1001
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,920
Where are you going?

1002
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,710
Someone introduced me to a job.

1003
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,190
At the courier transfer station near our home.

1004
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,190
Courier?

1005
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,560
Are you going to deliver packages?

1006
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,150
I'm not delivering packages.

1007
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,790
Courier transfer station.

1008
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,750
Aren't they all receiving goods at night?

1009
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,270
I'm matching the orders for them.

1010
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,750
Just enter the tracking number

1011
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,310
directly into the computer, that's all.

1012
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,000
Very easy.

1013
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,040
Clerical work.

1014
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,880
It's so late.

1015
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,120
Do you really have to go?

1016
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,040
I want to go.

1017
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,670
Meng'an,

1018
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,040
your dad was right.

1019
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,520
At my age,

1020
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,830
finding a job

1021
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,230
is really not easy.

1022
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,120
People

1023
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,000
have to swallow their pride.

1024
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:28,880
When it's time to be humble,

1025
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,080
you have to be humble, right?

1026
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,790
I gotta go.

1027
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,600
Don't worry. It's very easy.

1028
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,040
Maybe, if it's quick,

1029
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,440
I'll be back in the middle of the night.

1030
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,600
You rest early.

1031
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm off.
