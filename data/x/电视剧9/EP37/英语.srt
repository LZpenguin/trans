English subtitles are available

Just in Time EP37

3
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,400
Actually,

4
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
no matter how much you earn,

5
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,439
or how high your position is,

6
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,199
in the end, what matters most

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,999
is your family.

8
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,160
Your mom and I

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,279
are leading a life with

10
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,240
what people call the "Four Great Joys."

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,880
Know what they are?

12
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,600
What are the "Four Great Joys," Dad?

13
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,320
Steamed buns, boiled chicken,

14
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,520
morning nap, and old couples.

15
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,120
These are the "Four Great Joys" of people,

16
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,039
you know?

17
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,319
The first three joys

18
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,879
were given to us by you and Li Lin.

19
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,640
The last joy

20
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,240
was given to me by your mom.

21
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,599
No matter what,

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,039
we are the whole family.

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,999
When you get the chance in the future,

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,520
you can start it all over again.

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
I got your back.

26
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
If not, remember

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,839
that the light at home

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,439
will always be on for you.

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,599
Here.

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,559
What is it, Dad?

31
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,719
Take a look.

32
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,839
Haowen, remember this:

33
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,159
no matter what happens,

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,319
we are always family.

35
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,199
Diet control is very effective.

36
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,639
Your blood pressure is basically normal.

37
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,199
However,

38
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:46,999
you still need to

39
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:47,999
exercise more,

40
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,240
at least ten thousand steps a day.

41
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:49,999
I know.

42
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,160
I've done this before.

43
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,480
But it's different this time.

44
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,759
That was years ago.

45
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,319
Otherwise, it won't be easy.

46
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,800
Okay.

47
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,800
You need to do some exercise.

48
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,480
I'll walk ten thousand steps every day.

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,199
Don't you need to work?

50
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:00,559
Mom.

51
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,399
Are you going for a walk?

52
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,559
We can go together.

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Have you finished your homework?

54
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,079
Yes, I have.

55
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,439
Then, wait a moment.

56
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,360
We have something to discuss.

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:08,959
Jing,

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,199
you too, join us.

59
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,680
Come here.

60
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,600
What's going on?

61
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,840
Are we having a family meeting?

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,879
Alright.

63
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,959
I never know you have family meeting.

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,199
That's great.

65
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,800
Li Lin, come.

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,480
We're having a family meeting.

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,319
Coming.

68
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,639
I'll take that.

69
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,319
Well, you know,

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,600
I've

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,439
left my post.

72
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,879
What does that mean?

73
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,040
Does it mean you're unemployed?

74
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,280
It is leaving her post,

75
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,439
not being unemployed.

76
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,399
First of all,

77
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,600
it's because mom is pregnant.

78
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,399
Secondly, you're gonna have

79
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,759
the high school entrance exam.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,759
In this way she can accompany you.

81
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,759
It's not like that.

82
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,079
It has nothing to do

83
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,439
with you.

84
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,399
Don't feel burdened.

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,040
There was a problem at our company.

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,399
It needs to be transferred.

87
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,040
So, the middle and senior management

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,879
like us will be in an awkward situation.

89
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,800
Considering my current situation,

90
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,759
I decided to take a long leave.

91
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:08,840
It's called leaving the post,

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,040
which is almost like being unemployed.

93
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
I think it's good for you.

94
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
With your current situation,

95
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
nothing else is important.

96
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,319
You should stay healthy.

97
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
You love working so much.

98
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
How could you be unemployed?

99
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,999
No, it's temporary.

100
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,199
Just temporary.

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Not quite.

102
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:30,959
It's true.

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,759
Well,

104
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,160
I haven't even given birth yet.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,519
After giving birth, there's

106
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,959
still six months of maternity leave.

107
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,480
We can't be sure what will happen

108
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,360
in the company by then.

109
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,639
Finding a new job

110
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,759
is not easy these days.

111
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:40,959
So I thought

112
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,879
I should explain the situation

113
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,920
clearly to all of you.

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,199
Mom,

115
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,559
you love working so much.

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
But it comes to a sudden stop.

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,199
Do you feel like a fish out of water?

118
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,680
Do you see your mom as a workaholic?

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
Not really.

120
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,519
It's just that

121
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,399
it'll be a tough time for your dad.

122
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm fine, it's my duty.

123
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,199
I'm fine, too.

124
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,120
Here's my promise.

125
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,999
Mom, don't worry.

126
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,600
I'll definitely work hard

127
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,999
for the high school entrance exam.

128
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,240
I won't make you worry.

129
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,920
Here's mine too.

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
Taking care of you are the most

131
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,559
important thing in our family now.

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,319
Don't worry.

133
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,439
I'll definitely

134
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,199
do my best to take care of you.

135
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,399
We will ensure the baby

136
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,759
comes to the world safely.

137
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,160
This is the most important thing.

138
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,199
Nothing else matters.

139
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
And I also want to

140
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,439
tell you not to

141
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,439
worry about money.

142
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,079
Look, we still have

143
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,959
a clinic, don't we?

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,720
Although it's currently

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,959
managed by Mr. Ouyang,

146
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:34,759
but still,

147
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,680
don't you worry about it.

148
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,360
You two have shares in it.

149
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,480
Yeah...

150
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,079
I'm not worried about the money.

151
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,999
I have good news to tell.

152
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,319
Good news?

153
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,759
Quick, tell us!

154
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,840
It's that

155
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,720
Li Lin

156
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,199
is going to work in Beijing!

157
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,319
Great!

158
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:56,759
Does that mean I can

159
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,160
go sightseeing in Beijing?

160
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,759
How is that good news?

161
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,160
Just sit down!

162
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,079
What kind of person are you?

163
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,600
Your wife is about to give birth and

164
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,199
your daughter is about to take the exam.

165
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,439
Are you working far away?

166
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,519
Do you have any sense?

167
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,079
Jing...

168
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,079
Do you have any sense?

169
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,720
Jing, this is Li Lin's opportunity.

170
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,800
He has to go.

171
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,600
Mom,

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,519
if Dad goes to Beijing,

173
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,999
can he get a promotion?

174
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,759
Even for a raise, he wouldn't go.

175
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,559
Your mom's in a critical period right now.

176
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,399
Do you understand?

177
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,639
Jing, don't get angry.

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,800
I've thought about everything you said.

179
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,959
But you've seen

180
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,399
the situation yourself.

181
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,079
I'm unemployed now,

182
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:39,399
and we're having a second child.

183
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,519
When the second child is born,

184
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,679
won't we need money to raise it?

185
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,639
When Yunjie goes to high school,

186
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,600
won't we have to pay tuition?

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,279
In this case,

188
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
someone in the family has to

189
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,999
work hard.

190
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,919
Besides,

191
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,720
even if he goes to Beijing,

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,120
at home,

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
you and Yunjie can take care of me.

194
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,200
What do I have to be afraid of?

195
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:53,960
Right?

196
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,679
Yes.

197
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,679
Don't worry, dad.

198
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,080
I'll take good care of Mom.

199
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,279
When you get to Beijing,

200
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,560
remember to take me to eat roast duck.

201
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,399
I mean

202
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,639
his current job

203
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,679
is okay, isn't it?

204
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,480
No, it's not.

205
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,759
Beijing is better.

206
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,840
So he has to go.

207
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,960
I understand.

208
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
Then it's

209
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,120
a deal.

210
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,560
Deal.

211
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,399
What's your deal?

212
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,519
Did I say I'm going?

213
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,200
How ridiculous.

214
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,240
He...

215
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,919
He didn't say he was going, did he?

216
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,480
He

217
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,840
has to go.

218
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,759
I...I'll go check on him.

219
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,399
You go check on him.

220
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,840
Come on, stop eavesdropping.

221
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,759
Why, auntie?

222
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,560
Go back to your home.

223
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,440
Are you angry?

224
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,080
Did Mei Yiduo go to you?

225
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,960
What did she say to you?

226
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,600
She didn't say much.

227
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,600
Just...

228
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,759
Just...

229
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,560
Why do you ask me out so urgently?

230
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,600
Is there something wrong

231
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,960
with Li Lin?

232
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,399
Nothing wrong with him.

233
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,039
But Meng'an,

234
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,799
I hope you can give Li Lin

235
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,440
a career opportunity.

236
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,039
What opportunity?

237
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,840
Didn't he tell you?

238
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
Li Lin really is

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,759
a good man who puts family first.

240
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,759
What exactly is this opportunity?

241
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,360
Just tell me directly.

242
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,360
It's about working in Beijing.

243
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,679
Actually, he already rejected me.

244
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,120
But I don't want to give up.

245
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,840
I still want to give it a shot.

246
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,399
Does he need to go to Beijing?

247
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm going back to set up a lab.

248
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,399
This is the plan I asked Li Lin

249
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,480
to help me with.

250
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,799
He combined the domestic and international

251
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,999
markets and research needs

252
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,759
really well.

253
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,039
This is something

254
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,360
none of us thought of.

255
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
So I hope

256
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,440
you can persuade him to accept the offer.

257
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,759
After all, in the second half of life,

258
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,200
becoming the operations director

259
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,440
of a top laboratory

260
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,840
is an opportunity

261
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,360
that doesn't come often.

262
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,960
Are you mad at me?

263
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,320
How can I not?

264
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,039
Xu Meng'an,

265
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm over forty years old.

266
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,399
Don't I know

267
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,480
what I should do

268
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
and what I shouldn't?

269
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,039
I don't need you to decide for me.

270
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,360
In our family,

271
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
we always discuss everything

272
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,440
with each other,

273
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
no matter big or small.

274
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
For such a big thing,

275
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,039
you didn't talk with me.

276
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,360
Where is the democracy?

277
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,039
And what are those

278
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,759
sweet talks about?

279
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,639
Do they count?

280
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
Have you ever respected me?

281
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,600
Great virtue promotes growth; knowledge and

282
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,879
action are one. This is our school motto.

283
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,600
But it's not just a motto;

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,120
it should be

285
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,919
a guiding light in our lives.

286
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,840
It's a beacon.

287
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,159
Why do we study?

288
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,480
It isn't just about learning knowledge.

289
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,480
It's also about learning to respect others

290
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,759
and our own dignity.

291
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,200
Where is my dignity?

292
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,399
You tell me.

293
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,879
I didn't accept her offer.

294
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,600
Then what were you doing just now?

295
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
Talking nonsense

296
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,080
about it's a deal.

297
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,039
What's the deal about?

298
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,960
I was just thinking

299
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,159
about how I'll be out of work,

300
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,360
and we're expecting another baby.

301
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,480
We'll be counting on you.

302
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,720
Our living standards

303
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,840
would just drop, wouldn't it?

304
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,080
Do you really care about that?

305
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,080
You don't need to act in front of me.

306
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,639
You're talking nonsense again.

307
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,960
I'm telling you,

308
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,399
I'm not going.

309
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,039
I have my own plans.

310
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,799
I'm currently working for Director Ma

311
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,560
and I've got a lab there.

312
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,639
And my income is good.

313
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,360
If you think

314
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
our living standards

315
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,480
could be improved a bit more,

316
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,999
I can get another job.

317
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,320
I haven't done it before.

318
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,560
Is it necessary for you

319
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,039
to push me away like this?

320
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,799
What do you mean?

321
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,039
Who am I making space for?

322
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm pregnant.

323
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,320
You're pregnant now.

324
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,960
That's the very reason I can't leave.

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,919
I...

326
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,639
Isn't your sister here taking care of me?

327
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,600
What good is she?

328
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,159
Is she me?

329
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,840
Can she replace me?

330
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,080
Are you gonna spend your life with her?

331
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,240
No.

332
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,759
Then tell me

333
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,679
everything honestly.

334
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,639
Tell me the truth.

335
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
If I could keep you by my side,

336
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,600
I wouldn't want you to go, either.

337
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,919
Actually, I'm not forcing you

338
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,679
to Beijing to make money.

339
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,919
I just saw

340
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,799
that proposal

341
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,399
you wrote for Mei Yiduo.

342
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,320
It was so thick.

343
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,200
Looking at that proposal,

344
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,919
I thought

345
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,600
you must have a lot of ideas,

346
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,039
so you've written that much.

347
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,999
If you can write that much,

348
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,039
you must want to put it into practice.

349
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,480
I think we're the same.

350
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,399
Now you have a chance

351
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,080
to become

352
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,879
the head of

353
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,999
a top biology lab.

354
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,200
So...

355
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,360
Just go for it.

356
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,039
I know at your age,

357
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,679
it's hard to have

358
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,159
a chance like this.

359
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,600
Because of me and Yunjie,

360
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,639
you've already missed it once.

361
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,960
Although we're very happy,

362
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:04,639
but honey,

363
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,399
I really regret it.

364
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,879
I regret bringing you back with me.

365
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
I saw that thick proposal

366
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,759
and realized

367
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,039
that all these years you never

368
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,999
gave up on your dreams.

369
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,200
I want you to give it a try.

370
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,799
Honey,

371
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,879
please don't be angry.

372
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,080
Just go.

373
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,240
I don't want you to regret it again.

374
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
And don't make me regret it again.

375
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,759
Will you?

376
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,759
Just do it for me.

377
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,399
Go and try it.

378
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,279
Why are you crying?

379
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,759
You...Don't...

380
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,960
Don't just stand there, come here.

381
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,960
I want a hug.

382
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,879
If you go,

383
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,560
remember to miss me.

384
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,039
My lovely wife,

385
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,279
you're really dramatic.

386
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,159
Adults are talking.

387
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,600
Kids are not allowed to eavesdrop.

388
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,959
Dad got mad.

389
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,320
It's once in a blue moon.

390
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,479
I have to go and see it.

391
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,479
Stop.

392
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,120
Come back.

393
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,080
Why?

394
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,239
Go do your homework.

395
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,199
I've finished it.

396
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,360
Why don't you go find He Lu

397
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,239
and hang out with her?

398
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,040
I'm not going.

399
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,719
I'm waiting for Dad

400
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,439
to interview him.

401
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,080
Why doesn't he want to go to Beijing?

402
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,360
Stop adding to the chaos.

403
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,040
Alright?

404
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,479
What's so good about going to Beijing?

405
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,199
Isn't our family good enough now?

406
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,679
But Mom wants him to go.

407
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,360
And he dares to resist.

408
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
He even dares to lose his temper.

409
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,520
Dad is

410
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,159
about to rise up in the family.

411
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:50,919
Don't be stupid.

412
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:51,719
What are you thinking about

413
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,159
in your mind?

414
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,520
Anyway,

415
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,760
I vote yes.

416
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,800
Dad should go to Beijing.

417
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,639
When he comes out,

418
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:58,919
I'll have a good talk with him.

419
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:00,959
About what?

420
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:02,120
Working in Beijing.

421
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,800
He could get a promotion.

422
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,399
What a thing to brag about.

423
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,639
He'd be a fool not to go.

424
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
I think you're the fool.

425
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,239
People say daughters

426
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,959
are their mom's little comforters.

427
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,120
Are you a qualified little comforter?

428
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,719
Your mom is about to give birth.

429
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:20,520
If your dad isn't here,

430
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,959
how can she feel at ease?

431
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,919
Aren't we both here for Mom?

432
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,840
And there are my grandpa and grandma

433
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,000
and aunt Mengxin.

434
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:29,520
There are so many people in the family.

435
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,760
But it's not the same.

436
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,360
They're a couple.

437
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,679
No one can replace your dad.

438
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,399
Not even me.

439
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:35,959
Why is it different?

440
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,159
If it were me, I'd go to Beijing.

441
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,679
I really don't know what dad is thinking.

442
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,000
He is just too dependent.

443
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,360
If I were a senior, I'd definitely

444
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,760
study for a university in Beijing

445
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,560
to be a little further from my mom.

446
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,840
Didn't Cousin Hua

447
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040
go to Beijing for college?

448
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,560
He must have thought the same as I do,

449
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,159
trying to be further from you, too.

450
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,239
About the countdown to the exam,

451
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,080
why didn't you write the time down?

452
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:04,639
Why are you being so careless?

453
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,520
You don't seem urgent at all.

454
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,000
How am I being careless?

455
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
I remember it in my head.

456
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,679
What's the use of just remembering?

457
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,639
I want to see your actions.

458
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,639
Come on.

459
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,639
Auntie Jing will sit next to you

460
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,080
and help check your homework.

461
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,679
Come.

462
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm here with you.

463
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,719
Okay?

464
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,239
Come, sit here.

465
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,639
I think it's better

466
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:25,239
if my dad doesn't go to Beijing.

467
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,840
Yeah.

468
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
Exactly.

469
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,040
It's better my dad takes care of me.

470
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,199
Auntie Jing will help you

471
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,159
check your homework.

472
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,280
Children's art class.

473
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,959
Mind to take a look?

474
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:40,760
No, thank you.

475
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,080
Children's art class. Come take a look.

476
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,639
Hello, little boy.

477
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:44,199
Let me see.

478
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,000
Here you are.

479
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,520
No, thanks.

480
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,000
Children's art class. Come take a look.

481
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,000
No, thanks.

482
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,159
Children's art class.

483
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,159
Come take a look.

484
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:54,439
No, I'm fine.

485
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,199
Be careful.

486
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:56,800
Excuse me.

487
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,600
Take a look at our children's art class.

488
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,439
Now,

489
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,479
we'll give a small toy as a gift

490
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,760
if you register for a trial class.

491
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,600
Would you like some small toys?

492
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,719
We're gonna be late for class.

493
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,560
Mom,

494
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,959
I want a little rabbit.

495
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,320
We just need your contact information.

496
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,840
That's all.

497
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,439
Maybe next time.

498
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,000
Only your contact information.

499
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,879
Sorry about that.

500
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,080
It's okay.

501
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm so sorry.

502
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,439
Do come and take a look at

503
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,280
our training center later.

504
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,320
Come by when you have time.

505
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,760
Next time.

506
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,959
You're so careless.

507
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,000
Look at what you've done.

508
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,560
Be more careful next time.

509
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,520
It was an accident.

510
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:28,879
May I help you?

511
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:29,439
Take a look at

512
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,399
our art center.

513
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:32,959
Mr. Li.

514
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,639
Stop calling me Mr. Li?

515
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,000
Well,

516
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,040
Monitor Li.

517
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,000
How are you doing here?

518
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,439
Are you adjusting well

519
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,439
in my studio here?

520
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,360
Yes, I'm doing well.

521
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,280
Thank you

522
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,399
for offering me this job.

523
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,639
It's nothing.

524
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,840
No need to say that as we were classmates.

525
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,639
Come over for tea at my office.

526
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,159
Little Watermelon, Little Watermelon.

527
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,360
What do you see?

528
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,840
What interesting things have you seen?

529
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:00,159
What's over there?

530
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,879
Tell them we don't smell.

531
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:07,000
We're clean.

532
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,239
Isn't that right?

533
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,679
Let me see your hands.

534
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,479
It smells good.

535
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,159
We're in a great mood today.

536
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,159
Why are you so happy?

537
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:15,639
Dad,

538
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,439
mom.

539
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:17,360
I'm going .

540
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,840
Don't wait for me.

541
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,040
Dad, I'm going.

542
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,879
You're holding the bag upside down.

543
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,000
About face.

544
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:39,800
Forward

545
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,199
march.

546
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,320
Goodbye.

547
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,600
Bye, dad.

548
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,280
I'm telling you,

549
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,679
this is our Haowen.

550
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:02,399
As long as he gets out of this yard,

551
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:03,959
there's hope for him.

552
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,239
Indeed.

553
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:07,360
Just look at who his father-in-law is.

554
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,600
Your dad is amazing.

555
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,560
Look at your dad, fully revived.

556
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,560
Your dad is amazing,

557
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,000
right?

558
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,399
Hello, mom.

559
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,439
Xin,

560
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,959
I have good news.

561
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,280
Haowen just went out.

562
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:44,959
You mean Haowen went out?

563
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,959
Where did he go?

564
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,879
I don't know.

565
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:47,399
He said

566
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:48,199
he had something to do.

567
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,800
He'll be back very late tonight.

568
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:50,479
Alright, I got it.

569
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,120
Don't worry about him.

570
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,399
I'm so happy for him.

571
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's go.

572
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:57,679
Where are we going?

573
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,600
To the market.

574
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,159
Well,

575
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,280
hasn't Lanxiang already

576
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,639
bought a lot of groceries?

577
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:02,479
I want a salted fish to turn it over.

578
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,280
(To turn things around.)

579
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,000
Xin.

580
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,280
Why are you here?

581
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,520
I guessed you'd be here

582
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,959
to hide from Mom and Dad.

583
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,520
No,

584
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,560
they've been nice to me.

585
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,520
They've come to take care of

586
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,439
Little Watermelon from now on.

587
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,560
I gave them a heads-up

588
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:53,800
to leave you alone

589
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,879
so you can be alone for a while.

590
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:57,439
But they didn't listen.

591
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,879
They really are nice to me.

592
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,159
Alright, I understand.

593
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,080
With their

594
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,879
excessive enthusiasm,

595
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:04,959
even I want to come out

596
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,360
and have some peace,

597
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,520
not to mention you as a son-in-law.

598
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:09,679
Is Xiongxiong out of school yet?

599
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,239
Yeah, he's been taken home.

600
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:12,199
Don't worry.

601
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,520
Look, this is the good side

602
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,760
about living with mom and dad.

603
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,840
They can help us take care of the kids.

604
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,080
We have nothing to worry about.

605
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,879
Right?

606
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,080
Yes, we've got

607
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,399
nothing to worry about.

608
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,360
But the nicer they are to me,

609
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,840
the more I feel

610
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
sorry for them.

611
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,159
Today, dad and I went to the riverbank

612
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:32,360
and he talked to me a lot.

613
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,600
What did dad say to you?

614
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,199
He told me not to give up.

615
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,280
He also said

616
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,120
that I should be

617
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,320
a responsible man.

618
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,679
It was so encouraging.

619
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,439
But when I'm alone

620
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:46,280
and calm down,

621
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,199
I was wondering

622
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,520
what else I could do

623
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,959
and what our future would be.

624
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,159
I really don't know what to do.

625
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,320
In business,

626
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,879
there are ups and downs.

627
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,120
Isn't that normal?

628
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,479
Now that

629
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,879
we've returned to the starting point,

630
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,000
let's pull ourselves together

631
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,399
and start it over again.

632
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,639
Xin,

633
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,560
I've been thinking here all day.

634
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,080
What were you thinking about?

635
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,199
I was thinking

636
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,760
about how my business failed,

637
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,439
how I fell behind in the field,

638
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,280
how to catch up in the future,

639
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,679
and what to do in the future.

640
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,760
The more I think, the more I feel

641
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,679
confused.

642
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,199
You've only thought about it for one day.

643
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,679
What can you figure out in one day?

644
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,520
Haowen,

645
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
you don't need to rush.

646
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,719
Let's take it slowly.

647
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,280
If you really feel that mom and dad's

648
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,760
excessive concern

649
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,719
would be a burden

650
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,600
or a distraction for you,

651
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,560
I can

652
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,840
set up a table for you

653
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,879
right here.

654
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,439
Then you can come here to think.

655
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:42,760
I believe

656
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,080
you'll figure it out.

657
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:45,560
Really?

658
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,320
Of course.

659
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,560
After all, I'm here for you.

660
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,760
As long as we figure it out,

661
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
we'll quickly put it into action,

662
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,360
just like we did ten years ago.

663
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:52,280
We'll stand up

664
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,360
from where we fell.

665
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,719
Can we still

666
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,360
be like we were ten years ago?

667
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,760
We definitely can.

668
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,639
Guess what?

669
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:03,040
I called you today earlier

670
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,000
but couldn't get through.

671
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,760
I guessed you must be here.

672
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,439
Where is this place?

673
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,000
This is where we started our career.

674
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,399
It's our lucky place.

675
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,639
This lucky place

676
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:15,199
will definitely help us make a comeback.

677
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,159
Alright,

678
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,399
cheer up.

679
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,800
What's the big deal?

680
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,360
We're already at rock bottom.

681
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,159
From now on, each way will be uphill.

682
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,159
Hit me again.

683
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,439
My hand is hurt.

684
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,040
You do hit hard.

685
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,000
I'll go take the luggage downstairs.

686
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Alright.

687
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
I'll have a few words for you.

688
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,199
Have a seat.

689
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,040
Here.

690
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,600
Our home

691
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,360
is by the Fuchun River.

692
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Huang Gongwang's artwork

693
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,239
Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains depicts

694
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,199
the very mountains and rivers here.

695
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,959
There are lush forests and dense foliage,

696
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,760
surging river,

697
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,800
fishermen casting their lines,

698
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:18,639
and someone sitting alone in the picture.

699
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,159
Yet between the strokes of the brush,

700
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,520
it's more about

701
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:27,159
reflections on life

702
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,760
of a traveler in his middle age

703
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,159
and the exploration of

704
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,199
the theme of where home is.

705
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:38,679
Dear.

706
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm about to set off soon.

707
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,560
I have a few words to say to you.

708
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,199
Yunjie,

709
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,360
time flies like

710
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,679
a white horse passing through a gap.

711
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,280
In a blink, you've grown up.

712
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
But you will always be

713
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,879
daddy's beloved daughter.

714
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,439
Now, for you, Life is

715
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,399
just beginning.

716
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
There's more

717
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,639
brilliance ahead.

718
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,399
Make sure to love yourself.

719
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,639
Dad has written a few words

720
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,360
and put the paper on your desk.

721
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:20,760
Do read them from time to time.

722
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,399
My dear wife,

723
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,760
you're expecting a child now.

724
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:36,840
In the days I'm away,

725
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,360
take good care of yourself

726
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,600
and the baby.

727
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:43,760
Take some good rests.

728
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,560
Don't worry about me.

729
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:48,439
This will be

730
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,360
the longest we've been apart

731
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,639
from each other since we met.

732
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,560
It's a test

733
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,800
for both of us.

734
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,199
After this farewell...

735
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,199
Dad,

736
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,760
are you not gonna come back?

737
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:15,560
Of course, I will.

738
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,959
Did I say I wouldn't come back?

739
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,199
Of course, I'll come back.

740
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,639
This is my home.

741
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:21,600
Where else would I go?

742
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,679
I'm telling you,

743
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,199
I haven't left yet.

744
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,639
I feel like I shouldn't go.

745
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,760
I don't want to leave.

746
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
It feels like I've already come back.

747
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,120
Hurry up,

748
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,320
you're gonna be late.

749
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:31,959
Go quickly.

750
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I'm done talking.

751
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,520
Do you have anything to say?

752
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,199
Well,

753
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:52,679
then,

754
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,360
let's have a hug.

755
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,639
Let's have a hug.

756
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,399
Yunjie,

757
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:30,360
let's go.

758
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:31,520
Coming.

759
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:34,520
Mom, I'm leaving for school.

760
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,280
Okay.

761
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,479
Come here, give me a hug.

762
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,679
Take some time to miss me.

763
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,439
Drive carefully.

764
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,239
Put the dishes there after finish eating.

765
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,399
I'll come back and do the dishes later.

766
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Bye, Mom.

767
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,719
Goodbye.

768
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,360
Biparietal diameter is

769
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:44,560
8.39 cm.

770
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:47,520
Femur length is

771
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,800
6.3 cm.

772
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,080
Head circumference is 29 cm.

773
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,439
Abdominal circumference is 28.

774
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
Amniotic fluid

775
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,000
is fine.

776
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,280
The fetus is perfectly fine.

777
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:07,719
Please go to the

778
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,239
doctor's room after you've done here.

779
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,679
Okay.

780
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,040
Can you see if it's a boy or a girl?

781
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,280
It's not that clear.

782
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,040
Did the ultrasound doctor tell you

783
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,879
if it's a boy or a girl?

784
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:22,959
We're not allowed to know it now.

785
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:24,560
Yes, right.

786
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,800
We are not allowed to be told.

787
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,840
We won't break the rules.

788
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,959
Sit here and wait for a while.

789
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,199
I'll go buy you a bottle of water.

790
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:31,199
Alright.

791
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,159
Sit here and take a good look,

792
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:34,800
and enjoy this moment.

793
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,199
Here, be careful.

794
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,639
Here, be careful.

795
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,080
Honey,

796
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,560
how are you feeling?

797
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,199
I just had five tubes of blood drawn.

798
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,000
What do you think?

799
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:47,800
Here,

800
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,719
have some chocolates

801
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,600
to recover yourself.

802
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,959
I don't want it; it's too sweet.

803
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,080
Then have some fruit.

804
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:53,959
I also bought

805
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,360
your favorite cherries.

806
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,840
Alright.

807
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:57,760
Look.

808
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,399
I've got you big cherries.

809
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:01,399
Here.

810
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,760
You've suffered too much, honey.

811
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,600
Here, let me feed you.

812
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,280
Here.

813
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,760
Here, I'll get you a tissue.

814
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,399
Here.

815
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:17,920
Have another one.

816
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,400
Where are shall we sit?

817
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,159
Let's go there.

818
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,679
Let me help you, honey.

819
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,480
You must be tired, sit here.

820
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,080
Okay.

821
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,679
You're all sweaty.

822
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:30,920
It's okay.

823
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,719
Is it hot?

824
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,520
It's okay.

825
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,319
Let me wipe you off.

826
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:34,159
Don't be nervous.

827
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,239
We must be careful.

828
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
I bought some bread

829
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,040
and cookies for you.

830
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,679
Do you want more?

831
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,040
No, I'm good.

832
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,279
Let's have some fruit.

833
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:48,799
Here, have another one.

834
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,480
Hi, Ms. Wu.

835
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,120
Xin, well done here.

836
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:21,880
Ms. Wu,

837
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:24,120
I still want to be a teacher.

838
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,799
I used to study design.

839
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:26,600
Could you please help me with it?

840
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:27,520
Sure.

841
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,239
Then, please

842
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,319
help me organize these students'

843
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:30,359
assignments first,

844
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,159
then take photos

845
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,159
and send them to their parents.

846
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:32,960
Okay.

847
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,560
No problem.

848
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,480
I'll start taking pictures right away.

849
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:34,880
Okay.

850
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,520
Thank you for that.

851
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:36,880
Not at all. My pleasure.

852
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,920
Sir, you can't sit here.

853
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:09,560
Mengxin, Mr. Li is looking for you.

854
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,839
He wants you to go to his office.

855
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,080
Got it.

856
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,679
Why isn't she here yet?

857
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,759
Be patient! I just fetch someone for her.

858
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,560
Xin, come here.

859
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,920
Here.

860
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,159
Let me introduce someone to you.

861
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,679
I know you want to be a teacher.

862
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,719
This is Secretary-General Chen

863
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,080
from the association of art.

864
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,639
In the world of art,

865
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,719
he is highly influential.

866
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:36,359
Mr. Chen,

867
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,239
this is Xu Mengxin,

868
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,159
one of my classmates

869
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,400
I mentioned before.

870
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:42,040
So this is the campus belle

871
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,080
you've been talking about?

872
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,839
I've heard a lot about you.

873
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
Nice to meet you.

874
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:48,520
You're indeed very beautiful.

875
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,960
No wonder you were campus belle.

876
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,080
I'm too flattered.

877
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,480
I'm already

878
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,440
a mother of two kids now.

879
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,080
A mature woman

880
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,719
would be more charming

881
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,159
and more attractive,

882
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,719
and know more about life.

883
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,759
Mr. Li,

884
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,000
you have good taste.

885
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,199
I'll get some water for both of you.

886
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,359
Black tea or green tea?

887
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,239
Lemon tea.

888
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,359
And you?

889
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,560
The same.

890
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,239
Alright.

891
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,120
Why too much touching?

892
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,520
Isn't that part of social etiquette?

893
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,239
You are nuts about her.

894
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,359
Didn't you ask me

895
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,839
to evaluate her for you?

896
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,400
Did you just change

897
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,560
your type lately?

898
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,880
No wonder you

899
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,120
didn't bring young ladies

900
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,440
to our drinking parties anymore.

901
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,759
Young ladies

902
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,839
are too shy.

903
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,239
Well, now you like

904
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:43,880
mature women.

905
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,759
You've grown up,

906
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,359
starting to align with

907
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,080
us artists.

908
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,319
How's going with that campus belle?

909
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:51,719
What do you mean?

910
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,319
She's just a classmate.

911
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,080
What classmate?

912
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,120
Let me tell you.

913
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Women like this have real charm.

914
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,759
She looks like

915
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:01,639
a pampered rich wife.

916
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Interesting.

917
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,759
What rich wife?

918
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,319
She used to marry a rich man,

919
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,600
but her husband went bankrupt.

920
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,120
Beautiful as she was,

921
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,960
she looked down on everyone.

922
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,040
In her eyes,

923
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,239
I was just a poor student.

924
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,000
Now,

925
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,319
she's just begging

926
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
for a living at my studio here.

927
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:21,000
You're such a coward.

928
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,880
You've liked her for so many years.

929
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,839
Why don't you

930
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,359
seize this opportunity?

931
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,639
Are you waiting for the New Year?

932
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,120
Well, what opportunity?

933
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,400
She's a mother of two kids.

934
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,639
I'd be the one losing out.

935
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,199
You just...

936
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,679
Mr. Li

937
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:43,839
I...

938
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:47,000
Here's yours.

939
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,400
No, I'm fine.

940
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,040
Just put it down.

941
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,159
Don't bother.

942
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,639
You two beasts in human clothing.

943
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,000
Mom, it's time

944
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,239
to video chat with Dad.

945
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,880
It's still a few minutes away.

946
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,080
Why are you so strict about a video call?

947
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:51,920
Meng'an.

948
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,400
Are you

949
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,759
still at work?

950
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm working overtime today.

951
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:57,920
Everyone is here.

952
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,400
Time you to show us something.

953
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,080
Let's see

954
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,960
what you're doing now.

955
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,040
Wanna see my workplace?

956
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,120
Look.

957
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,560
This is my office.

958
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,000
Over here,

959
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,239
my colleagues are all here.

960
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:08,960
This is my daughter.

961
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,719
Hi.

962
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,600
Everyone's greeting.

963
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,159
Hello.

964
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,199
Mom, look.

965
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:14,960
No, I'm not.

966
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,199
You talk to your dad.

967
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,520
Where is the beautiful lady?

968
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,480
You mean Miss Mei?

969
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,480
She was here a moment ago.

970
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,080
I don't know where she is now.

971
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,400
Well done, Mr. Li.

972
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Again, here are the

973
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,600
key points for you:

974
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,159
video chat with my mom

975
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,440
every evening at seven;

976
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,359
attach locations to your WeChat Moments,

977
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,560
so we will know

978
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,159
your whereabouts.

979
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,480
These are all key points, okay?

980
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,880
Okay.

981
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,080
Don't just give me key points.

982
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
Have you mastered the key points

983
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,480
for the high school entrance exam?

984
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,440
Don't worry.

985
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,279
My mom and my aunt

986
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,440
are taking care of my studies.

987
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,159
I'm almost driven crazy by them.

988
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,080
Dad,

989
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,239
I really miss you now.

990
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,679
I miss you too, Yunjie.

991
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,960
Exam preparation is truly important,

992
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,560
but you also need to rest.

993
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,080
Eat something good and sleep well.

994
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,639
Okay, got it.

995
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,759
I'll give you and mom five minutes

996
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:05,759
to talk privately.

997
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:06,480
Here.

998
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,319
Well, close the door.

999
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:17,440
Hello.

1000
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,920
I'll go outside and talk to you.

1001
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,440
We're eating meals here,

1002
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,440
while Director Li is showing us romance.

1003
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,759
Director Li

1004
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:26,799
will report his schedule to his wife

1005
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:27,960
every day at dinner.

1006
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,679
It's their family rule.

1007
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,239
What kind of family rule?

1008
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,880
Isn't that just being henpecked?

1009
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:34,679
That's loyalty.

1010
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,679
Do you understand?

1011
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:36,279
What kind of loyalty?

1012
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,359
It's the restraint of love.

1013
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,719
No wonder you've been single these years.

1014
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,199
Is it close to the due date?

1015
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:46,199
Not yet, there's still a month.

1016
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,080
Still a month?

1017
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,639
Didn't the doctor say

1018
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:50,199
that Little Grape's

1019
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,719
had adequate months?

1020
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,000
Doesn't that mean

1021
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,520
you could give birth any time?

1022
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,120
It's okay.

1023
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,440
I've taken time off.

1024
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,719
I'll be back this weekend

1025
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,960
and the week after next week.

1026
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,960
Is that okay to take so much time off?

1027
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,560
Why don't you

1028
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,000
wait until the due date

1029
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,960
and come back then?

1030
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,480
I've already requested time off.

1031
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:13,920
Mei Yiduo also agreed.

1032
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:14,759
Anyway,

1033
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:16,679
I still have maternity leave.

1034
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
But don't take too much

1035
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,159
maternity leave.

1036
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:23,120
Don't be like Haowen who

1037
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,239
took two months of maternity leave

1038
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,960
and left the company bankrupt.

1039
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,120
Now the whole family depends on you.

1040
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,759
I'm not trying to pressure you.

1041
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:32,639
I know what I'm doing.

1042
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:36,080
Honey.

1043
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,319
Babe.

1044
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,719
I miss you.

1045
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,880
I miss you, too.

1046
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,239
Take care of yourself

1047
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:50,480
since you're all alone there.

1048
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,279
I'm doing good.

1049
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,759
No need to worry about me.

1050
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,719
Okay?
