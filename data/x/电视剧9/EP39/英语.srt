3
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,600
These dishes

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,520
were made by your dad.

5
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,710
Eat some.

6
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,400
Mom,

7
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,270
My condition is different from Mengxin.

8
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,320
I had a natural labor. No need to feed me.

9
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,880
I'll eat it by myself.

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,070
But your hand...

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,400
Take care. It hurts.

12
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,070
I'm fine.

13
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,400
Little Grape.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,430
I had a natural labor.

15
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,350
The doctor said I could walk tomorrow

16
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,550
and I'll be out one day later.

17
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,630
Don't walk.

18
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,270
Look.

19
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,470
You're in postnatal confinement.

20
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,800
You've to have a good rest.

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,710
Or you'll develop chronic illnesses later.

22
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,430
The doctor said

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,750
I could walk.

24
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,870
It's helpful

25
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,960
in body recovery.

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,150
The doctor said it.

27
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,030
Well.

28
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,550
Then you can take a little walk.

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,830
You need to rest and recuperate properly.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,360
Women suffer a lot to deliver a baby.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
I know this quite well.

32
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,870
I'm so happy to see the baby.

33
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,750
Meng'an,

34
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,360
it's worth the time and effort, isn't it?

35
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,710
Little Grape.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,360
Jing.

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,400
Having a second child at this age

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,310
is not easy for An.

39
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,990
Yes.

40
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,710
She suffers a lot.

41
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,550
It's okay.

42
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,550
Giving birth to a baby at my age

43
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,680
may postpone

44
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,640
my menopause for a few years.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,550
Stubborn.

46
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,480
Just eat it.

47
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Quickly. It's getting cold.

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,480
Meng'an.

49
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,520
My husband

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,270
sent me

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,710
Little Grape's

52
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,680
names on my phone.

53
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,710
Wanna check them?

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,520
No, no.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,030
She can't be staring at the phone screen.

56
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,200
No.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
It's alright.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,550
Nope!

59
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,550
Too much phone time during

60
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,080
postnatal confinement will hurt your eyes.

61
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,870
Fine.

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,200
No more watching it.

63
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,830
I'll read it to you.

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,030
Listen up.

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,240
Li Haoyu.

66
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,030
Li Jialin.

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,750
Li Ruixian.

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,520
Li Ruixian is a very nice name, isn't it?

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,310
It's meaningful.

70
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,120
Well,

71
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,520
Jing,

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,960
giving baby's name

73
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,710
can wait.

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,120
I suggest

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,710
we go back first.

76
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,480
Look,

77
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
Meng'an didn't sleep well last night.

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,360
She looks tired.

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,990
Just eat some and go to sleep.

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,960
We've disturbed her rest.

81
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,310
Let's go back. Go.

82
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,960
It's okay.

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,480
You can leave first.

84
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,240
It's a mess here.

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,150
I've to tidy up

86
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,590
after she eats it.

87
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,310
Besides, she needs me to attend her.

88
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,710
No need. Xin is coming right away.

89
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,480
Well, don't worry about me.

90
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,480
Jing,

91
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
you didn't get much rest last night.

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,960
And you haven't eaten either.

93
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,200
Why don't you come to my place

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,550
and let me cook you some food?

95
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,960
You can have a good rest there.

96
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,520
I've learned traditional Chinese medicine.

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,280
I'm good at health maintenance.

98
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,600
Taking a day or two to look after her

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,680
is not a big deal.

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Though you studied TCM

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,950
and you can keep healthy,

102
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,990
you have to eat

103
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,430
and sleep.

104
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,840
Or it's harmful to your body.

105
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,280
You know?

106
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,840
Go, go.

107
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Go back!

108
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,070
Are you okay to stay here by yourself?

109
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm okay.

110
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,390
Jing,

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,920
you go to my mom's home

112
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,720
to have a meal

113
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,950
and take some sleep.

114
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,550
No need to do anything else, okay?

115
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,040
Okay.

116
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
Wait.

117
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,680
Little Grape,

118
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,510
I'm leaving.

119
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,480
I'll come back to see you soon.

120
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,160
Let's go.

121
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,990
I don't bear to leave him.

122
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,550
Yeah.

123
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,920
I just wanna see him.

124
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,870
Take you time to eat it.

125
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,550
Uncle, press here.

126
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,480
Yeah. Otherwise, it will all stick up.

127
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,430
Decorate red eggs with stickers?

128
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,950
Jing!

129
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,630
Look,

130
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,550
everyone is busy event this happy event.

131
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,310
Mr. Xu,

132
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,870
did you check the name?

133
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,720
The name

134
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,480
my husband gave.

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,430
It's in the house.

136
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,070
Come!

137
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
Jing,

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,310
can we talk

139
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,990
about naming the baby?

140
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,800
Ms. Wu,

141
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,950
If you think

142
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,190
the name given by my husband

143
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,360
isn't good,

144
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,070
it doesn't matter.

145
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,160
You can find an expert

146
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,680
to think out new ones.

147
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm sure we can get

148
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,750
a name we're happy with.

149
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,800
I didn't mean that.

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,950
Look,

151
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,870
I've also got names for the baby.

152
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,430
Do you like to take a look?

153
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,120
Okay.

154
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,190
Let me see.

155
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You all give a lot of care.

156
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
Xu Zirui,

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,680
Xu Ziqi.

158
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,360
Ms. Wu,

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,310
what do you mean?

160
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,550
Let me explain.

161
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,360
My husband and I have discussed it

162
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,950
with Meng'an and Li Lin,

163
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,430
before the baby

164
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,800
was born.

165
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,040
Hua is your eldest son.

166
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,840
His surname is Li.

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,476
He took his maternal grandpa's last name.

168
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,720
His grandpa's wish

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
was fulfilled, right?

170
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,160
So, I just thought

171
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,950
about letting

172
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,630
the baby

173
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,480
take the surname

174
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
of the Xu family.

175
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,990
Does Li Lin agree?

176
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,920
They all agreed.

177
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,070
I don't agree!

178
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,280
Little Grape is a boy.

179
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,950
The Li family's only grandson.

180
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,480
His last name must be Li!

181
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,070
Jing, take it easy.

182
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,920
It's not about the gender.

183
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
You know,

184
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,800
when we discussed it,

185
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,120
we didn't know Meng'an's baby

186
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,600
was a boy or a girl.

187
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I just wanna

188
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,680
fulfill the wish of my husband.

189
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,510
Can you understand it?

190
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
I can't!

191
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,870
Jing,

192
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,360
Jing, are you not having a meal here?

193
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,070
I'm pissed off!

194
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
What's wrong?

195
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,310
Here you are. Let's stick together.

196
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,360
Take it.

197
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,310
It breaks.

198
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,950
Great!

199
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,630
It breaks bad luck.

200
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,040
It's all about naming.

201
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,070
You're even laughing?

202
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,440
Wake up!

203
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,870
Jing,

204
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,480
let me sleep a little longer.

205
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,480
I had a poor sleep last night.

206
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,510
I've to go to the hospital

207
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,750
to take care of Meng'an later.

208
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,120
Something big has happened.

209
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,440
What's wrong?

210
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,200
Is it about Little Grape?

211
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,958
Little Grape's last name has been changed.

212
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,670
What?

213
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,150
Yes, Little Grape takes the surname Xu.

214
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,200
This is serious!

215
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,630
You didn't tell me!

216
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,320
Lin.

217
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,960
Have some orange juice.

218
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,360
Okay.

219
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
This isn't orange juice

220
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,750
judging from its color.

221
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,630
It doesn't matter.

222
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,510
I'll drink it.

223
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,080
I forgot it.

224
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,990
You don't like sweet drinks.

225
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm into it.

226
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,030
Lin,

227
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,600
since Little Grape was born,

228
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,750
have you thought about his name?

229
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,790
No, we haven't.

230
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,720
Not yet?

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,150
Right.

232
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,240
Listen,

233
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,870
I came up with a few ones.

234
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,670
Really?

235
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,030
Great, Mom.

236
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,240
Tell me about them.

237
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,910
The name of your sister's son

238
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,870
is Hua.

239
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,480
Right?

240
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
His last name is Li?

241
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Yes, right.

242
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,440
Let me explain.

243
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,510
When my sister and my brother-in-law

244
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,360
got married,

245
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,270
my dad made my brother-in-law

246
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,560
take charge of everything.

247
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,360
So, after they had

248
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,510
a son and a daughter,

249
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,440
the boy took the last name Li,

250
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,750
while the girl's last name is Ouyang.

251
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,360
Great! What a harmonious relationship!

252
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:26,990
Yeah, exactly.

253
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,560
Right?

254
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,360
We worked together.

255
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,960
So,

256
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,080
after your second baby is born,

257
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,030
the baby's last name will be Xu?

258
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,560
okay.

259
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,600
Okay?

260
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,150
Will the last name be Xu?

261
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes.

262
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,120
Let's get closer as a family!

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,240
How nice it is!

264
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,270
Isn't it?

265
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,360
I knew it.

266
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,030
Lin, you're educated

267
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,870
and reasonable.

268
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,910
I knew you'd agree.

269
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,560
I've talked over with your father-in-law.

270
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
I'll get you some soda water.

271
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,910
No, no. I...

272
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,960
Have we reached an agreement?

273
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,440
Were you told

274
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,480
by Meng'an's mother?

275
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,120
You're a fool!

276
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,750
If Little Grape is a girl,

277
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,870
it's okay.

278
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,600
But he's a son.

279
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,120
Our mom passed away early.

280
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,870
Our dad cared much

281
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
about the continuation of the last name.

282
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,910
If you change Little Grape's last name,

283
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,960
the Li family line won't be existed.

284
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,630
I understand.

285
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,360
I understand.

286
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,320
But what you said

287
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,600
isn't right.

288
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,870
How could it be gone?

289
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,080
Doesn't Hua

290
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,670
take

291
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,990
the last name Li?

292
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,270
It's not same.

293
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,320
When Yungjie was born,

294
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,200
you didn't plan to have a second child.

295
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,560
Hua's last name was changed to Li

296
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,870
as I had no option.

297
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,910
It's all

298
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,480
for the Li family line.

299
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,320
Yes.

300
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,600
When Meng'an was pregnant with 2nd child

301
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,150
we didn't know

302
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,560
it'd be a boy or a girl.

303
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,390
No more talking about it. It's irrelevant.

304
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,750
I know your intention.

305
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,270
Fine.

306
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,150
You can change it if you want.

307
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
But you've to change Yunjie's last name.

308
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,270
Nonsense!

309
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,670
How can Yunjie's last name be Xu?

310
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,560
She is fifteen years old.

311
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,320
It can't be changed

312
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,390
and it's hard to do it.

313
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,200
Little Grape's surname can't be changed.

314
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,630
Jing,

315
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,270
relax.

316
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:05,870
I'll discuss it

317
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,670
with Meng'an

318
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,840
and then talk with her other families.

319
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,600
Don't get yourself involved in.

320
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,390
When you step in,

321
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,480
a small thing

322
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,360
could develop

323
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
into a serious problem.

324
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,600
How can this be a trivial matter?

325
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
You're the eldest son.

326
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
Little Grape is the eldest grandson.

327
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,670
This is

328
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,390
a big deal to the Li family.

329
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,910
Okay.

330
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,360
Don't worry.

331
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,240
I'll definitely

332
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,480
find the best solution to it.

333
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,360
Aright.

334
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,790
I'll be waiting for it.

335
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,600
If you can't give me a satisfied answer,

336
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,480
I won't leave here.

337
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,390
The soup Jing made

338
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,990
is so tasty.

339
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,910
I've to talk to you.

340
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,670
Jing

341
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,080
went to your mom's home.

342
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,840
When she got back,

343
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
she was upset.

344
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,030
Why?

345
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,030
For...

346
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,240
For the naming?

347
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,630
You've known it?

348
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,150
When Mom urged Jing to return with her,

349
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,120
I've found her intention.

350
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,510
My mom

351
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,600
was splitting hairs.

352
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
I thought Jing

353
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,990
was not gonna cook for me anymore.

354
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,510
Not possible.

355
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,960
Jing said

356
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,080
you needed to have more soup

357
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,270
for detox.

358
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,750
Jing is so nice.

359
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,670
What do you think

360
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,480
about the naming?

361
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,080
What about your thought?

362
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:55,990
I...

363
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm not that fussed.

364
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,790
He's my son,

365
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,990
no matter what his last name is.

366
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,390
Right?

367
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,670
Can you just tell me the truth?

368
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,270
Biologically speaking,

369
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,150
I'm okay with it.

370
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,320
Though his last name could be Li,

371
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,990
he's still my son.

372
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,480
Right?

373
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,600
However,

374
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,600
traditionally speaking,

375
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,270
I'm not

376
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,320
okay with it.

377
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,390
So, it depends on what I value most.

378
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,870
My mom

379
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,150
got an idea

380
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,790
and put us in a pickle.

381
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,390
Won't she

382
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,840
feel sorry for the baby?

383
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,870
She had that idea

384
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,670
with a reason.

385
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,870
You may not understand.

386
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,750
Let me help you figure out

387
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,480
the Xu family's situation.

388
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,270
I don't need you view

389
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,560
my family situation.

390
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,270
She just felt sorry that

391
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,790
she didn't give birth a son

392
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,320
for my dad.

393
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,600
But why didn't she find a way out earlier?

394
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,960
Why does she have to bother us about it?

395
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,480
It's no use talking about it now.

396
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,360
Now that she asked for it,

397
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,200
we should

398
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,560
fix the problem.

399
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,080
And

400
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,150
your dad talked with me about it as well.

401
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,390
My dad?

402
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,080
When was it?

403
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,320
What did he say?

404
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,990
He said, "Li Lin,

405
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,120
if your mother-in-law asks about this,

406
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:31,840
tell her

407
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,440
I've already talked with you about it.

408
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,670
It's your turn."

409
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,790
My dad!

410
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,960
He went too far!

411
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,200
He only cares my mom's feeling.

412
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,080
Though he cares my mom,

413
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,240
it's his

414
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,960
business.

415
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,120
Why did he torture you by saying that?

416
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,360
Don't you care about me?

417
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,560
Yes, I do.

418
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,750
That's enough of that.

419
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,320
We'll talk about this matter later.

420
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,030
The problem can't be avoided.

421
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,670
Li Lin, you know what?

422
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,990
It lies on

423
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,120
how we treat this naming matter.

424
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,720
Seriously speaking,

425
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,960
it bears on the family lines.

426
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,720
On a smaller scale,

427
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,200
it is matter of our family.

428
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,480
Since it's our family issue,

429
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,750
we'll talk about it together

430
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,510
when Yunjie comes.

431
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,270
Good idea.

432
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,240
I take your point.

433
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,750
It has to be fixed

434
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,910
in a democratic way.

435
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,080
No!

436
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,390
Why do I have to change it?

437
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,390
As Little Grape is a boy,

438
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,630
you ask me to change my last name?

439
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,720
No, no.

440
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,200
Listen.

441
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,720
If your last name is Xu,

442
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,560
it's also good to you.

443
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,320
Take your maternal grandpa's last name,

444
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,990
then you'll also inherit

445
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,510
part of your grandma's house and money.

446
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,910
I promise,

447
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,960
you'll also get your share

448
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,910
of the clinic

449
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,320
and the house of the Li family.

450
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,360
What if I don't change it?

451
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,440
You intend to disinherit me of them,

452
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,960
don't you?

453
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
I didn't mean that.

454
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm discussing it with you.

455
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,080
I just don't get it, Aunt.

456
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,030
You're a woman.

457
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,720
Why'd you prefer a boy over a girl?

458
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,510
It's not the preference.

459
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Aren't we in a special situation?

460
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,240
Let me tell you...

461
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,510
Yunjie!

462
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,840
Where are you going?

463
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,720
None of your business!

464
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,120
The last person I want to see now

465
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,080
is you!

466
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,870
Are you able to walk?

467
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,360
I've to do it.

468
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,520
The doctor said I need to walk.

469
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,280
Did the doctor say that?

470
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,120
If you can't, go back and lie in bed.

471
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,080
This is

472
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,230
Yunjie.

473
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,190
Why is she squatting on the ground?

474
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,950
You go to see her.

475
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,840
Okay, you take care.

476
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,560
Yunjie,

477
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,390
why are you here?

478
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,670
Yunjie!

479
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,800
What's wrong?

480
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,800
Yunjie?

481
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,800
What's wrong?

482
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,280
What's the matter with you?

483
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't cry!

484
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,670
What's going on?

485
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,600
Who bullied you?

486
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,600
Tell me!

487
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,080
Tell me.

488
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,230
Tell me.

489
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,950
My aunt

490
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,360
told me to change my last name.

491
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,320
What?

492
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,080
I don't want to change it.

493
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,670
Don't call her aunt anymore!

494
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,080
No need to change it, you know?

495
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,870
Li Yungjie.

496
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,000
Your name is always Li Yunjie!

497
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,390
No one in the world

498
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,390
can change your name!

499
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,800
That's too much of her!

500
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,840
Lower your voice. We're in the hallway.

501
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,190
Yungjie, your dad's right.

502
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,840
Your name won't be changed.

503
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,080
Your name is Li Yunjie.

504
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,120
No one can change it.

505
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,600
Your dad can decide it.

506
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:22,910
Yes!

507
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,560
You know?

508
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,600
Just remember one thing.

509
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,080
Mom gave birth to you

510
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,670
and your brother.

511
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,600
No matter

512
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,760
what your brother's surname is,

513
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,910
he's your biological brother.

514
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,670
When mom and dad are old,

515
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,000
you are

516
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,320
the closest siblings

517
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,430
in the world.

518
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,080
Get it?

519
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
You've to guide him

520
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,600
and support each other.

521
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,560
Yunjie must be

522
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,600
feel aggrieved.

523
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Come and let Mom hug you.

524
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,230
Come.

525
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,080
Come.

526
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,840
Mom.

527
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,430
My dear daughter, you're wronged.

528
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,230
My dear daughter.

529
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,190
Mom and dad

530
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,190
have been waiting here for you.

531
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,950
We have something to discuss with you.

532
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,280
What's it about?

533
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,560
Oh, brother.

534
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,760
There is one thing

535
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,910
I've to tell you.

536
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,390
Here's the thing.

537
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,470
Our aunt

538
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,360
hopes you to take Dad's last name Li.

539
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,910
Our grandparents

540
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,950
want you to take Mom's last name Xu.

541
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,360
Which one will you select?

542
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
How could he answer you?

543
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,710
He couldn't.

544
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,000
Let's not

545
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
be in a dilemma.

546
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,390
Or else,

547
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,950
just get him your last name.

548
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,470
My last name?

549
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,950
How can you face your family?

550
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,910
Can you explain about taking my last name?

551
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,230
Oh,

552
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,360
neither of us can't face our families.

553
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,000
I have an idea!

554
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,800
He'll neither name after you nor you.

555
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,470
He'll name after me.

556
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,040
What's wrong?

557
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,280
You said

558
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,670
Little Grape is my biological brother

559
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,120
all my life.

560
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,280
And I'm gonna lead him

561
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,950
and take care of him.

562
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,840
So, he can take my last name.

563
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,910
Any question about this?

564
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,710
No.

565
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,520
Good!

566
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,040
It's a deal.

567
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,600
My dear brother,

568
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,470
you'll have a name.

569
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,150
It's Li Yanwu.

570
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,230
Li Yanwu?

571
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,080
The Chinese word Xu combines Yan and Wu.

572
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,710
My daughter has a lot of wisdom.

573
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,230
That's a great name.

574
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,710
It sounds like a leader's name.

575
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,000
He's gonna be a big shot.

576
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,430
That's good news for celebration.

577
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:00,870
Also,

578
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,800
Yunjie's had an excellent performance

579
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
in her high school entrance examination.

580
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,320
It's also worth celebrating.

581
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,870
Let's do it!

582
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,630
We can eat fried chicken

583
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,710
and barbecue.

584
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,320
Wonderful!

585
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,840
Mom,

586
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,390
can you eat the food now?

587
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,280
I...

588
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,360
I guess I can taste a little bit.

589
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,670
But you guys can eat it.

590
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,520
When you're enjoying it,

591
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,710
I'll be happy.

592
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,150
Perfect.

593
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,280
Place an order online.

594
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,280
Order take-out?

595
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,470
If we go back to cook, they'll find out.

596
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,120
She is smart!

597
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,560
And thoughtful!

598
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,120
Li Yanwu.

599
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,080
It's done.

600
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,760
I've finished my homework.

601
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,360
It's time

602
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,800
to play with you.

603
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
Little Grape.

604
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,870
Do dome exercise.

605
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,080
Very good!

606
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,870
Wanna get up?

607
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,390
I've to be gentle.

608
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,520
You're great!

609
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,120
Had a full sleep?

610
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,190
You're so lovable.

611
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
It's almost time.

612
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Come on.

613
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,150
She hung up.

614
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,190
Why?

615
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,150
It's 7 pm.

616
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,870
The time is right.

617
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,710
Yunjie?

618
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,520
[Hello, Dad.]

619
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,600
What's your mom doing?

620
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,950
She was not answering my calls.

621
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,190
My mom?

622
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,470
She is working.

623
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,710
Work?

624
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,670
What job is it?

625
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,080
She didn't tell me.

626
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,080
There's a lot you don't know.

627
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,760
My mom seems to

628
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,630
have a project.

629
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,870
She is working on it at home.

630
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,870
Look, I'm babysitting my brother.

631
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,390
[Babysitting?]

632
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,800
[You? You're bragging!]

633
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,560
Don't think I can't do it.

634
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,190
You know what?

635
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,150
When you come back,

636
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,520
he may not listen to you.

637
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,080
But he must listen to what I'm saying.

638
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,710
[He stops crying when I tell him to.]

639
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,870
He'll laugh when I ask him to.

640
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,560
Don't brag.

641
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,870
Let me see Little Grape.

642
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,430
Show me

643
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,520
how you

644
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,280
tickle him.

645
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,000
Watch it.

646
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,280
Baby.

647
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,320
Little Grape.

Well.

660
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,000
It's only more than a minute.

661
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,150
I wanna see him more.

662
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,280
Good, He.

663
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,710
This scheme

664
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,320
got the right direction.

665
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,230
You've grown a lot in 6 months!

666
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,560
You've got a clear mind.

667
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,040
Yeah, He.

668
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,000
Have your ideas straightened out?

669
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,190
I was inspired by Meng'an.

670
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,520
You can

671
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,950
take charge of the work alone.

672
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,150
Let's wrap it up.

673
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,760
Okay?

674
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,470
We can discuss it next time.

675
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,470
What's up?

676
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,560
Time to make the video call.

677
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,120
It slipped my mind.

678
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,470
I was in a meeting just now.

679
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,950
Didn't you make a video call to Yunjie?

680
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,040
She talked with me.

681
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,390
But it was just for a minute.

682
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,870
She hung up.

683
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,760
What...

684
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,120
what work are you doing?

685
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,560
Nothing.

686

It's

687
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,190
as same as before.

688
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,390
I was doing a part-time job.

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,950
No need to do that.

690
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,840
Listen up.

691
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,230
You'd better

692

No more nagging.

699
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,230
I only saw him for a minute.

700
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,150
Show him to me again.

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,560
Okay. You'll see him again.

702
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,670
Let me show you.

703
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm gonna show you.

704
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,470
Your dad wanna see Little Grape.

705
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,230
Mom,

706
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,760
why was he crying?

707
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,520
Is he hungry?

708
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,120
No, it's not the time.

709
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,040
Did he poo?

710
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,560
You're right.

711
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,470
Stinky!

712
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,280
Hurry up! Take him away.

713
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,360
I don't want the baby.

714
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,280
What did you say?

715
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
Nonsense!

716
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,600
Hasten to get some water.

717
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,670
Take a basin

718
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,390
and get some water.

719
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,520
Are you cleaning it on my bed?

720
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,390
If not,

721
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,360
where can I do it?

722
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,950
Don't stain my sheet.

723
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,760
Dear,

724
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,800
the

725
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,040
camera

726
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,950
isn't filming the baby.

727
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,000
I can't see him.

728
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,840
It'll be done soon.

729
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,600
Seriously? It's lunch time.

730
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,870
But he pooed.

731
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,760
He is so small,

732
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,670
but his poo stinks.

733
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,360
You're avoiding it?

734
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,190
You also shit when you were a baby.

735
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,760
Come on.

736
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,470
Quickly.

737
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,470
Tissues.

738
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,320
With your reaction,

739
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,120
aren't you embarrassed to brag

740
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,910
that you help dispose

741
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,670
his shit and piss a lot?

742
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,950
I don't care what you say!

743
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,870
I just can't wipe his poop!

744
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,320
Well,

745
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,360
go pour it.

746
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,280
Don't wanna do it?

747
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,670
I must say

748
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,280
I pour his shit and the piss a lot.

749
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
All right, take your time.

750
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,040
I...

751
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,950
I'll make the video call

752
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,950
to you next time.

753
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,190
Well, I'm gonna hang up.

754
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,040
It'll be done right away.

755
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,430
I'm hanging up.

756
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,280
Okay.

757
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,870
It's done.

758
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,320
Here.

759
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,670
Let Mommy hold you.

760
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,520
Baby.

761
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,040
Baby.

762
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,840
It's alright.

763
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,360
Hello, everyone.

764
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,560
Please take a look.

765
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,390
For this baked finishing powder,

766
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,670
the half of the face with it

767
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,910
looks delicate and well.

768
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,360
The other half of the face without it

769
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,390
looks not that good.

770
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,000
One of the fans

771
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,320
asked that

772
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,430
if she could use this cosmetic

773
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,520
during her pregnancy.

774
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,470
So, our brand anchor

775
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,360
is gonna introduce it for you.

776
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,710
This product

777
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,670
is purely made from plants and natural.

778
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,560
It's mercury-free,

779
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,120
lead-free,

780
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,280
and without other harmful substances.

781
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,190
I'm a mom

782
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,910
of two children.

783
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,560
So, I can

784
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,390
prove to you.

785
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:16,760
Even if

786
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,840
you're in lactation

787
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,600
or gestation period,

788
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,080
you can use it with confidence.

789
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,710
I was shocked.

790
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,000
You are already

791
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
a mother of two children.

792
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,760
Yeah.

793
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,950
You're great.

794
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,360
How to address you?

795
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,520
Hi,

796
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,150
everyone

797
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,670
in Dongzi Live Streaming Chat Room.

798
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,910
I'm Hot Mum.

799
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,470
Dongzi, thank you so much.

800
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,470
Not at all.

801
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,870
Thank you.

802
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,840
Please see him off.

803
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,520
Okay.

804
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Thank you very much for your support.

805
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,840
That's what we should do.

806
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,710
We need to cooperate a lot.

807
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,560
Yeah, sure.

808
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,390
Contact us if there is business.

809
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,600
Is Hot Mum

810
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,710
your personal account?

811
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,320
Yes.

812
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,190
I've kept you in mind,

813
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,190
Hot Mum.

814
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,800
I think

815
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,320
you have a good eye for products.

816
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,430
You're very professional

817
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,390
in beauty makeup field.

818
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,120
I believe we'll work together again.

819
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,630
That will be great.

820
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,710
In fact,

821
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,320
I've learned a lot

822
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,470
by working with you.

823
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,910
So,

824
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,520
thanks a lot.

825
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,520
My pleasure.

826
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,870
I'll link up with you privately on live.

827
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,470
Bye-bye.

828
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,320
Yes!

829
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,430
Don't call me with nothing serious.

830
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm not available.

831
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,150
Why did she hang up as well?

832
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,710
What is she doing?

833
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:03,910
Cook meals.

834
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,520
Finish cooking.

835
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,520
Have the meal.

836
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,000
Feed the baby.

837
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,520
And Yujie needs to eat as well.

838
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
Adults have to take turns eating.

839
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,710
Do the dishes.

840
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,000
It's a tight schedule.

841
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,320
Meng'an's to check Yungjie's homework.

842
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,320
Then it'll be 9 pm.

843
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,800
So, I've to put off

844
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,120
the video call.

845
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,600
I can call at 7 pm

846
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,560
and 9 pm.

847
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,470
Dear!

848
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,600
Dear!

849
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,150
Look!

850
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,710
My follower has increased to 100,000.

851
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,390
Have you seen it?

852
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,360
I've been making deliveries,

853
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
so, I've not noticed it, baby.

854
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,000
You know what?

855
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,870
The number could go up even more.

856
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,470
Do you believe it?

857
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,760
What did you do?

858
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,950
Dongzi, the celeb anchor, followed me.

859
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,670
Dongzi?

860
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,670
He also asked me to join him on live.

861
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,670
Let me see what to wear.

862
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
How about this?

863
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,600
I'm with a domineering lady style.

864
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,630
He's younger than me.

865
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,670
The fans will love to see our interaction.

866
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,430
Take a look.

867
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,390
Look.

868
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,150
How does it look?

869
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,870
You think I'm old?

870
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,870
Why do you interact with a younger man?

871
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
You're jealous.

872
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
You have dirty thinking.

873
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,360
Quit it!

874
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,950
It's to draw more followers for account.

875
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,040
Really?

876
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,080

for me to interact with him online,

878
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,120
I could get 100 thousand followers, too.

879
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,120
Here it is.

880

Put it on.

881
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,120
You think I dare not wear it?

882
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,670
Just put it on.

883
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,150
Little Grape's food

884
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,150
is simple.

885
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,360
It's rice paste.

886
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,670
Never put in more. Two spoonfuls are okay.

887
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,390
Want children to stay healthy?

888
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,870
Don't overfeed him or overclothe him.

889
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,950
Come on, better for his mom to feed him.

890
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,280
Okay.

891
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,360
You're good at it.

892
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,080
Whatever you say!

00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,430
Let me feed him.

894
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,080
Your hands just cleaned up the poop.

895
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,190
I washed my hands.

896
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,870
So?

897
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,840
You mean

898
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,520
my hands are useless after poop cleaning?

899
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:45,910
Mom,

900
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,080
I'll be honest.

901
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,190
You always

902
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,560
don't put a harness on Little Grape.

903
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,910
He becomes strong now.

904
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,390
It's dangerous for him not to wear it.

905

What's the foremost in baby care?

[Put on a harness.]

909
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,800
Baby specialist,

910
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,280
so, you just feed him

911
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,190
but won't care about him pooing?

912
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Well, you haven't done a complete job.

913
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,040
No more talking about pooing.

914
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Not decent.

915
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,870
A baby

916
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,870
will

917
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,040
shit and piss every day,

918

Don't worry.

You'll eat steaks.

934

Wonderful.

935

Woman fans are not that easy to get.

970
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,190
But,

971
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,560
their brand loyalty is high

972
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,910
and they spend a lot.

973
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,560
Look. We can also

Okay?

976
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,560

he was very pleased with me.

979
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,150
I was smart

980
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,520
and added him as a WeChat friend.

981
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,430
I gave him my account,

982
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,630
then he accepted it right away.

983
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,600
Isn't it cool?

984
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,000
You're a mom of two children.

985
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,600
Yet you were proactive to a man.

You are a dad of two children.

987
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,710
You were contacting female influencers

988
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,120
back in the day, right?

989
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm a man!

990
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,440
Hey, as a man, is it okay

991

and then have a coffee

993
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,230

You're still holding on to this thing.

Are you settling a score with me now?

998
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,960
So what? Who started this?

Okay, okay, you win.

1000

Look.

1001
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,960
He brought you live streaming traffic,

1002

and added your WeChat.

1003
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,350
This is about

1004
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,080
business and money.

1005
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:58,630
Why?

1006
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,750
Why did he do that?

1007
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,880
Because I'm exceptional.

1008
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,750
I'm a top player

1009
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,150
in the beauty anchor business.

1010
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,230
He offered to sign a contract today.

1011
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,310
He has a livestreaming team,

1012
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,350
with lots of internet influencers.

1013
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,270
If he signs a contact with me,

1014
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,440
I'll be a big influencer as well.

1015
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,350
Don't do that.

1016
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,270
Why do you have to sign it with him?

1017
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,520
We decided to start our own business

1018
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,670
and do living streaming on our own.

1019
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,040
Why do we need to sign it with him?

1020
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,830
Are you dumbhead?

1021
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,180
You are dumbhead.

1022
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,740
You!

1023
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,440
When you're in his trap,

1024
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,400
you'll be even helping him.

1025
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,190
You said I was dumbhead?

1026
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,670
You're. He is an internet celebrity.

1027
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,750
He's willing to sign a contract with you

1028
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,440
and lead you.

1029
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:25,960
What does that mean?

1030
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,560
It means you gotta seize the opportunity!

1031
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,350
Look how excited you are!

1032
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,830
I think he's gonna seize you!

1033
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,830
Seize the opportunity...

1034
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,750
Who am I?

1035
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,000
Xu Mengxin.

1036
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,600
Who does Xu Mengxin belong to?

1037
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,790
Of course, it's...

1038
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,670
Take a look!

1039
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,270
You make me startled!

1040
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,150
Extreme joy gives rise

1041
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,270
to sorrow!

1042
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,040
And you're even laughing at me.

1043
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,830
It hurts.

1044
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,790
Sorry, sorry, dear.

1045
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,670
That's pathetic.

1046
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,350
You're on live streaming a lot

1047
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,830
that your mouth is dry.

1048
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,750
You've worked hard.

1049
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,670
That's right.

1050
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,630
When you meet that guy in future,

1051
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,350
you can do this.

1052
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,670
You do it like this.

1053
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,400
Then he'll sign the contract with you.

1054
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,880
The pain is gone.

1055
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,520
I'm okay now.

1056
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,560
Am I awesome?

1057
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,880
Yes, you're.

1058
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,670
Let's kiss again.

1059
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,600
Hello, Dongzi!

1060
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,350
Hello, Hot Mum!

1061
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,350
We meet again.

1062
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,630
Dear followers,

1063
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,600
this is Hot Mum,

1064
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,080
the beauty anchor.

1065
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,230
Hello, everyone.

1066
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,080
I'm Hot Mum.

1067
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,000
Welcome!

1068
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,080
Welcome you.

1069
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,880
You know,

1070
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,080
my fans

1071
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,790
miss you so much!

1072
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,270
Since they knew we'd interact online,

1073
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,440
the number of people online in our studio

1074
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,400
has increased by nearly 50 thousand.

1075
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,190
Well,

1076
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,150
how about

1077
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,400
joining Dongzi' fan family?

1078
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,920
Really?

1079
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,790
Can I?

1080
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,920
Dear fans,

1081
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,790
do you welcome

1082
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,670
Hot Mum

1083
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,440
to join Dongzi's fan family?

1084
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,120
If yes,

1085
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,440
please input one

1086
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,520
on the screen, please.

1087
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,480
If not, please input two.

1088
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,670
Now let's get the number rolling.

1089
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,480
There are a lot of ones.

1090
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,600
The ones are already all over the screen.

1091
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,440
Goodness,

1092
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,710
you'd better

1093
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,440
think about it seriously.

1094
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,000
Well, then I gotta give it some thought.

1095
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,710
I'm looking forward to you

1096
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,600
 joining us.

1097
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,790
Alright.

1098
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,080
Dongzi,

1099
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,400
let's hurry up

1100
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,040
to introduce our first product.

1101
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,000
Hot Mom is so happy.

1102
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The fans number is soaring.

1103
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,600
It's so great!

1104
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,830
My assistant, please bring me

1105
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,480
the first product.

1106
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,120
Let Dongzi get it for you.

1107
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,560
Ladies, hold on a second, please.

1108
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,440
Because my helper

1109
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,230
is a little senior

1110
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,830
and elder than Dongzi.

1111
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,150
So, he reacts slowly.

1112
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,600
Let's wait a sec for him.

1113
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,040
He'll be here soon.

1114
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,710
He is coming.

1115
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,790
Here he is.

1116
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,480
What is it?

1117
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,190
A Lipstick gift box.

1118
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,350
The box is amazing,

1119
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:40,830
ladies.

1120
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,880
Ten lipsticks

1121
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,960
with various colors are in it.

1122
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,560
It's for personal use or as a gift.

1123
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,080
Mr Yu,

1124
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,600
as the founder of Blue Ocean,

1125
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,400
you can't bear

1126
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,440
to do massive rectification of it.

1127
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,350
In that case,

1128
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,080
it can't reach the expected target

1129
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,560
of our investors.

1130
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,150
No, Mr Zhao,

1131
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,040
please

1132
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,560
let me explain.

1133
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,080
Please give me more time.

1134
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,120
I think Blue Ocean

1135
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,960
is stable in our business foundation.

1136
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,830
It just takes time

1137
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,000
for it to be profitable.

1138
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,790
If we make a

1139
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,350
big rectification of Blue Ocean,

1140
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,560
it's like acting with undue haste

1141
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,670
and not the right way!

1142
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,190
You know?

1143
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,790
Yu Hai,

1144
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,040
you should listen to us,

1145
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,440
and not object to us.

1146
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,440
Now the majority shares of the company

1147
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
are in our hands.

1148
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,560
You're just a small shareholder now.

1149
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,920
We can let you

1150
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,750
be the CEO.

1151
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,830
But if you

1152
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,190
doesn't protect our interests,

1153
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,790
We can kick you out in a minute.

1154
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,270
All right, stop arguing.

1155
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,670
Let me say something.

1156
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,600
Mr Yu,

1157
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,310
your business capabilities

1158
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,310
are obvious to all.

1159
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,750
The profit of Blue Ocean

1160
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,520
is positive in the long run.

1161
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,920
But you've to understand our position.

1162
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,230
What investors want is

1163
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,190
earn more money.

1164
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,000
The capital investment has a deadline.

1165
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,750
We have an exit mechanism.

1166
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,120
Hope you'll

1167
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,190
consider these suggestions

1168
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,400
thoroughly.

1169
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,230
Then the

1170
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,400
next conference call can be arranged.

1171
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,190
Alright?

1172
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,040
Meeting adjourned.

1173
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,520
Wanzhen,

1174
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,080
I know you reminded me before.

1175
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,350
Financing is a double-edged sword.

1176
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,920
Looks like I'm losing my bet.

1177
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,270
I'm gonna lose

1178
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,270
the whole Blue Ocean.

1179
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,830
Sorry.

1180
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,040
I didn't listen to you.

1181
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,710
But do you really think

1182
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,230
I should

1183
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,630
give up control of the company?

1184
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,400
Lin.

1185
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,440
Yiduo.

1186
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,600
Why haven't you gone back yet?

1187
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,560
I have a telephone meeting

1188
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,350
with a North America partner later.

1189
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,440
It's so late.

1190
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,790
Why are you still here?

1191
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,270
I'm catching up with the progress.

1192
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,310
I hope

1193
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,310
our lab

1194
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,270
is able to go public and operate.

1195
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,630
You're so hasten to do it.

1196
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,040
The earlier it's done,

1197
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,120
the sooner

1198
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,670
experimental results you can get.

1199
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,480
Then I can go home.

1200
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,670
Honestly, if I don't go back soon,

1201
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,630
my family will forget me.

1202
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,120
You're exaggerating!

1203
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,230
You're the breadwinner of your family.

1204
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,350
I'm out there,

1205
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,920
so, it is my wife who

1206
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,790
takes care of the family, right?

1207
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,230
You've got something to say?

1208
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,150
I've got good news to tell you.

1209
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:06,960
Have a seat.

1210
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:07,670
Okay.

1211
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,350
A national-level

1212
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,400
biological lab

1213
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,480
is

1214
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,440
under preparation.

1215
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,560
You're

1216
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
very fit

1217
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,350
for the position of technical director.

1218
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,270
I think

1219
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,440
after our lab

1220
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,750
goes public,

1221
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,230
I can recommend you to them.

1222
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,230
Then you'll be in charge

1223
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,630
of lab projects.

1224
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,960
You can become

1225
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,270
a big shot

1226
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,920
in the field.

1227
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,150
