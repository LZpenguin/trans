00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,240
Just in Time EP32

3
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,999
Will the company

4
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:50,919
replace me

5
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,520
with someone else

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,800
after I have my baby?

7
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,079
No way.

8
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,960
Impossible.

9
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,079
After giving birth,

10
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,040
you'll only take a three to five-month

11
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,120
maternity leave, right?

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,760
There's no way they'll replace you.

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,279
You're the Content Director.

14
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,160
But now there's a better fit

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,919
for Content Director than me.

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,199
She is younger,

17
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,320
and energetic,

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,199
with a fresh perspective.

19
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,199
All her focus

20
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,479
is on work.

21
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,800
Whenever I see

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,039
her performance,

23
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,039
I can't help but wonder

24
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,039
if we're not as capable as she is,

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
and no longer needed?

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,039
I get what you're saying,

27
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,680
but I don't agree.

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,920
They may be youthful,

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,200
full of vigor and drive,

30
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,680
yet they tend to make mistakes,

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,480
and take risks,

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,279
unlike us in middle age,

33
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,400
who are experienced,

34
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,719
reliable,

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,039
and trusted by our bosses.

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,960
The company certainly

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,319
needs to grow,

38
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,559
but stability is more crucial.

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,559
Moreover, there are

40
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,159
hardly any young executives

41
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,080
in companies.

42
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,200
You're right.

43
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:51,800
So, now,

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
just focus

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,039
on nurturing pregnancy

46
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:54,839
to ensure the smooth delivery

47
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,240
of our baby.

48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,120
This is of

49
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,960
utmost importance

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,080
to you,

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
to us,

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,719
and to our whole family.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,240
But if they make a mistake,

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,360
should I point it out?

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Of course.

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,559
You must.

57
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,039
You're still working,

58
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,240
still getting paid, right?

59
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,400
It's your responsibility.

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,999
I must be responsible.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,240
Right.

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,999
This month, new member sign-ups

63
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,039
exceeded 300,000,

64
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,039
New user activity

65
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,599
increased by 32%.

66
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,559
The retention, conversion and ROI,

67
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,920
all get improved significantly.

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,240
We've surpassed Blue Ocean

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,439
to become the company with the most

70
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,279
registered users locally.

71
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,839
Though our market share is

72
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,080
not as high as that of Blue Ocean,

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,159
our shareholders

74
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,240
are quite satisfied

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,360
with our recent performance.

76
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,960
Mr. Zhang,

77
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,960
with the traffic up,

78
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,159
our marketing department's job

79
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,400
got easier.

80
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,159
In mere this month,

81
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,960
we saw

82
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,520
a 30% increase in ad sales.

83
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,360
At this pace,

84
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,839
we might become

85
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,120
the market leader.

86
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,559
Good.

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,800
If anyone else has any comments,

88
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,599
any ideas,

89
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,520
now's the time to share.

90
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,879
I'd like to mention

91
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,960
risk mitigation.

92
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,640
Network regulation

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,719
is tightening.

94
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,879
I've heard a few companies have

95
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,839
already received fines.

96
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,120
Rachel,

97
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,439
have you hired

98
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,039
the compliance officers?

99
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,639
I have.

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
This is serious.

101
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,840
I immediately posted

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
the job ads online.

103
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,199
I noticed Miss Huang also got fined

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,840
when promoting this combination strategy

105
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,959
in Blue Ocean.

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
I'm taking it seriously.

107
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,680
So, we must strengthen regulation.

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,600
Meng'an,

109
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,280
the project

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,559
is underway.

111
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
It's like a battle.

112
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,999
I said to charge ahead,

113
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,800
so, let's not talk about pulling back.

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,160
Otherwise, how can we win?

115
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,840
Here's a thought: how about

116
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,319
you go help Mr. Zhou with debt collection?

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
We have many outstanding receivables.

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,639
It hurts company operations.

119
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,800
I'll personally handle

120
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,240
Miss Huang's issues.

121
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Great.

122
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,040
Mr. Zhang,

123
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,680
since it's so important,

124
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,480
I'll accompany Ms. Xu

125
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,600
to collect the debt.

126
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,199
She's a content creator.

127
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,999
It would be embarrassing for her

128
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,720
to collect debts.

129
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,280
Besides, she is pregnant.

130
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,999
She can just sit there,

131
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,519
and leave the negotiation to me.

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Maybe it'll work.

133
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Alright.

134
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,639
Take care of Meng'an.

135
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,680
Thank you, Rachel.

136
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,519
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

137
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,879
Maybe

138
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,559
we can give Mr. Lin a call.

139
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,840
Maybe tomorrow.

140
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,680
We're done for today.

141
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,519
Let's

142
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,879
head home soon.

143
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,639
Doesn't that seem a bit off?

144
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,519
Didn't you understand

145
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,600
Mr. Zhang's hint?

146
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,800
He didn't mean for you to collect debts,

147
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,280
but rather wanted us to step out

148
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,360
refrain from interfering

149
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,720
with their traffic plans.

150
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,840
Our task is now complete.

151
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,439
Later,

152
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,559
I'll make a post

153
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,199
on WeChat Moments

154
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
and mention Huang Sisi.

155
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,879
Let her know

156
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,079
how different

157
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,800
our work is.

158
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
You wanna have banquet on company's funds?

159
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,600
Mr. Zhang asked us

160
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,639
to collect debts.

161
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,920
This meal will be considered a business expense,

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,280
and I'll ask Mr. Zhou to foot the bill.

163
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,240
Don't bother,

164
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,319
I'll take care of the bill.

165
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
I don't want them

166
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,920
to think I'm exploiting

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,879
the company

168
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,519
because of my pregnancy.

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,439
They've already taken a dislike to me.

170
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,959
How have you transformed,

171
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,399
since becoming pregnant,

172
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,120
from a tigress into a paper tiger?

173
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,240
You don't know me well enough.

174
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
True,

175
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,879
you're highly deceptive.

176
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,399
You seem to fear nothing,

177
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
but that's all acting.

178
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,079
Soft inside, huh?

179
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,079
You know how psychology

180
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,959
defines this?

181
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
Speak plainly.

182
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Because

183
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,840
it is fear and anxiety

184
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,240
that push you forward.

185
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,120
That's

186
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,879
not correct.

187
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,959
That stings.

188
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,439
But this is the case

189
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,120
for 90% of the people nowadays.

190
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,959
You're not the only one.

191
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,600
What can I do?

192
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm pregnant.

193
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,360
It's noticeable.

194
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,720
They all know that.

195
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,040
Whenever I become emotional

196
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,559
and express a different opinion,

197
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,439
they attribute it

198
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,920
to high levels of pregnancy hormones.

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,759
I'm pregnant,

200
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,999
not stupid.

201
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Mr. Zhang even thinks

202
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,280
I am losing my mind.

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,999
That hurts. You know that?

204
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,480
You're fine.

205
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,720
He won't fire you.

206
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,800
So just take it easy.

207
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,959
Is this the time to lie down?

208
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,360
Clearly,

209
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
Mr. Zhang is

210
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,639
taking a gamble.

211
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Would you dare to let him gamble?

212
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:17,999
If he wins,

213
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,999
I'm out.

214
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,920
If he loses,

215
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,639
the company is doomed.

216
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,680
This isn't the time to take it easy.

217
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,399
So, what do you want to do?

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,480
It's not up to me.

219
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,720
Then let him gamble.

220
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,920
He won't turn back

221
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,240
unless he loses everything.

222
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,800
It's not up to you anyway.

223
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,080
Since

224
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,999
Little Watermelon was born,

225
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,120
you've been walking more steadily.

226
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,240
I believe you'll

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,999
be able to run again

228
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,560
once Meng'an gives birth.

229
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,799
See how well you walk!

230
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,799
Sit down and rest.

231
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
Sit down.

232
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,560
Let me wipe the sweat

233
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,399
off your forehead.

234
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,960
Almost finished.

235
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,639
It's all sweaty.

236
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,080
Would you

237
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,879
like a sip of water?

238
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,799
Oh my, again I forgot to refill the bottle.

239
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,360
I... I won't

240
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,999
make the mistake again.

241
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,679
Blame on you.

242
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,560
You always spoil me,

243
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,519
and never let me do any chores.

244
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,399
It's your fault.

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,919
I think Xin and Haowen

246
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,639
argued again.

247
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,519
That's why she came back suddenly.

248
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,679
Right?

249
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,639
Xin is definitely

250
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,639
being capricious again.

251
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,120
Do you think so?

252
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Am I right?

253
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,879
But I think,

254
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,639
now that Xin has had a second child,

255
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,159
Haowen should

256
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,519
give her some slack.

257
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,120
Right?

258
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,600
If he's sensible,

259
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,240
how could he possibly argue with Xin?

260
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,120
He should be soothing her instead.

261
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,080
Am I wrong?

262
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,560
They've been arguing

263
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,320
quite often recently.

264
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm concerned that

265
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,360
their feelings of love fade

266
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,440
due to the frequent fights.

267
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Minor spats are no big deal,

268
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,919
but this time it feels like

269
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,440
something's off.

270
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,639
What's your opinion?

271
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,560
You... You got me confused.

272
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,360
Do you agree or not?

273
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,399
Am I right?

274
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,960
Right.

275
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,039
Listen,

276
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,519
I think our whole family

277
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,159
should cater

278
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,799
to Xin's needs.

279
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,200
It's hard for a woman to give birth

280
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,159
and recover.

281
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,879
She needs to stay calm.

282
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,720
You know,

283
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,560
if she stays calm,

284
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,919
she won't have lingering issues.

285
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,320
Right?

286
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:29,759
Right.

287
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,919
It makes sense, right?

288
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,080
Yes.

289
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,159
Well then,

290
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,799
you should talk to

291
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,919
Haowen about this matter.

292
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,240
I...

293
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,960
can't

294
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,159
speak clearly.

295
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,519
You're overacting.

296
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,999
Gotcha!

297
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,399
You old rascal,

298
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,320
you scared me!

299
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,679
Stop teasing me.

300
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,879
I'm scared to death.

301
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,600
Such an actor!

302
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,399
Talk to Haowen about this when you are free.

303
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,919
Talk.

304
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,679
Talk.

305
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:20,720
Talk.

306
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,159
Someone is fishing over there!

307
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,560
Let's go and have a look.

308
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,159
Looks like a big one.

309
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,159
Let's go.

310
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,360
Sorry, I didn't support you properly,

10311
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,679
using the wrong force.

312
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,240
Careful.

313
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,240
Looks like they've caught a big one.

314
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,999
Look.

315
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,600
Xin,

316
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,039
I'm here to pick you up.

317
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,519
I knew it.

318
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,679
I knew you couldn't leave me.

319
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,600
Let's go home.

320
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,279
Pack your things.

321
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:24,480
Okay.

322
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,240
Then divorce.

323
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,440
Haowen!

324
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,120
Haowen!

325
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,480
Xin, you're awake.

326
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Is Haowen here?

327
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:41,080
I... I made some cubilose soup for you.

328
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,360
I'll put it here.

329
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,879
Remember to eat it.

330
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,200
Mom,

331
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,440
take care.

332
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,279
Okay.

333
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,879
Call me if you need anything.

334
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:09,279
Got it.

335
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,039
Have you got everything?

336
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:10,679
Yes.

337
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,560
Do you have the house keys with you?

338
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,320
Yes, I put them in this handbag.

339
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,519
Mom, don't worry,

340
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,519
this time I'll teach her

341
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,399
a lesson.

342
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,440
Don't be too harsh.

343
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,440
After all, Xin

344
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,399
did give you two kids.

345
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,919
If you feel embarrassed,

346
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,440
I can

347
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,240
visit your mother-in-law.

348
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,399
No need, mom.

349
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,919
Your son's smart enough

350
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,440
to handle this.

351
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,360
Don't worry.

352
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,960
Alright.

353
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,320
Call me when you get home.

354
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:37,999
Okay.

355
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
Be kinder to Xin.

356
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,560
I will.

357
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,480
Don't quarrel with her.

358
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Alright.

359
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,560
Pluck those leaves.

360
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,799
There you go.

361
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,919
He hasn't fully recovered yet.

362
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,720
Leave it to me.

363
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,799
I'll do it.

364
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,679
Ma'am,

365
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,600
let him do it.

366
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,879
Go on, do it.

367
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
Look, sir,

368
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,879
look at me.

369
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,560
Pluck the leaf

370
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,200
with force.

371
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,399
He lacks strength.

372
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,039
That's why I want him to do it by himself.

373
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,639
Life lies in movement.

374
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,720
And if

375
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,200
he can pluck it,

376
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,960
he will be more confident.

377
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,039
Sir,

378
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,039
use your hands

379
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,679
to pluck the vegetables.

380
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,639
Right, use your hands.

381
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,200
Pluck it.

382
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,519
Pluck it.

383
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,360
Give it a try.

384
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,919
There you go.

385
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,519
Come on.

386
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,399
You can do this.

387
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,240
Come on.

388
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,560
See, he's smiling!

389
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,360
Gradually,

390
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,039
he will be more confident.

391
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,519
Good, good.

392
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,840
Let me tell you

393
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,960
how to manage his diet.

394
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,080
Just a moment,

395
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,120
I need to write it down.

396
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,799
You can take notes.

397
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,720
His

398
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
blood sugar

399
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,039
is slightly elevated, right?

400
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,639
He needs more than medication.

401
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,639
Dietary regulation

402
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,919
is essential.

403
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,240
Cut down

404
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,399
on rice

405
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
and wheaten food,

406
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,200
as well as his intake of

407
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,519
some veggies, namely,

408
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,240
pumpkin,

409
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,399
pickled lotus root,

410
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,560
and potatoes.

411
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,480
Pickled lotus root?

412
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,159
It's made of lotus root.

413
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,360
Right.

414
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,120
Don't regard them merely as veggies.

415
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,840
Keep in mind

416
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,360
that they're staples,

417
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,600
and their consumption can lead to

418
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,919
a rapid increase in blood sugar levels.

419
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,919
What should

420
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,600
I do then?

421
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,360
He can't go hungry.

422
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,039
He needs to consume more whole grains.

423
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,679
Is Little Watermelon crying?

424
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,399
Yes.

425
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,159
Did you hear that?

426
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,199
Neither did I.

427
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,479
Little Watermelon's crying?

428
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,080
No.

429
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,520
She just woke up,

430
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,000
but didn't cry.

431
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,280
I heard her cry.

432
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,520
No,

433
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
she's fine.

434
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,000
Mommy's here.

435
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,800
Mommy's here to see you.

436
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,239
Pumpkin, lotus root, potatoes.

437
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:12,800
No.

438
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Whole grains,

439
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,679
buckwheat.

440
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,919
He can consume

441
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:17,520
more buckwheat.

442
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,479
Plucking vegetables?

443
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:20,479
Meng'an is back.

444
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,560
Welcome back, An.

445
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,520
What's for dinner?

446
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,919
Celery dumplings.

447
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,280
Where's Xin?

448
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,159
Just returned to her room.

449
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,080
Be careful.

450
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,239
He's happy as soon as An returns.

451
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,320
Yeah.

452
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,080
Let them chat.

453
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,959
Go on.

454
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,199
The buckwheat...

455
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,879
What's wrong?

456
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,800
Xin,

457
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:58,120
not right.

458
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,479
Haowen

459
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,439
didn't pick her up.

460
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,800
Both

461
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,120
aren't right.

462
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:16,600
Check with Xin.

463
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,520
Okay.

464
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:43,040
You're back.

465
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,320
What's up?

466
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,560
I've been sitting all day.

467
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,560
Let's take a walk.

468
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:09,959
I'll look after the baby,

469
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,000
don't worry.

470
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,520
You need a break.

471
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,399
Lanxiang will

472
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,760
take care of her.

473
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,520
Don't worry.

474
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's go.

475
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,239
Come with me.

476
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,080
I feel as if I've returned to my childhood

477
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,159
back when you would hold my hand

478
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,679
and walk with me along the riverbank.

479
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,199
What's wrong?

480
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,800
Am I too old

481
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,840
to walk fast now?

482
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Of course not.

483
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,840
I want to be by your side forever.

484
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
Sounds great, let's take a rest.

485
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,199
Xin,

486
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,520
I've noticed you

487
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,239
seem a bit down lately.

488
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,520
What's bothering you?

489
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Is everything ok?

490
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,320
I think Haowen has changed.

491
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,280
Haowen?

492
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,399
Why do you say that?

493
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:35,840
He took

494
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:39,159
all my luggage to our parents' house.

495
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,239
When did this happen?

496
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,879
Just a few days ago.

497
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,840
If it had been in the past,

498
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,600
he would certainly come

499
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,000
with plenty of gifts

500
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,120
to cajole me into returning home.

501
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,719
But this time, he simply set the gifts down

502
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,600
and left.

503
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,199
I know he loves

504
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,159
kids, however,

505
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,040
this time, he barely spoke to Xiongxiong,

506
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,280
and didn't

507
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:13,439
even glance at Little Watermelon.

508
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:17,239
Something's off.

509
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,679
Maybe you're overthinking.

510
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,280
Everyone sees how

511
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,560
Haowen treats you.

512
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,719
We wouldn't lie to you.

513
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,080
Honestly,

514
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,040
I think you

515
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,159
also went overboard this time.

516
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,239
You came back with the two kids,

517
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
leaving Haowen to work alone

518
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,159
in a different city.

519
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
He must be very upset

520
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,239
and lonely

521
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,639
coming back

522
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,320
to

523
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,199
an empty house.

524
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,000
It must have been tough for him.

525
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,560
Maybe

526
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,320
he's angry too,

527
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,520
playing hard to get.

528
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,000
Isn't that part of your relationship?

529
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,159
But it's different this time.

530
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,399
Sometimes,

531
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
I'm frustrated with myself.

532
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,959
I don't know what's wrong with me.

533
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,479
I feel like I'm a grumpy woman,

534
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
interested in

535
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,000
nothing,

536
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,159
and dissatisfied

537
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,280
with anything.

538
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,520
I used to be

539
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,639
so confident,

540
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,840
and optimistic.

541
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,439
But look at me now.

542
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
I don't know why.

543
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,800
The moment

544
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,199
I start to speak,

545
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:12,679
my thoughts turn into

546
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:13,959
something completely different.

547
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,479
How did it come to this?

548
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,199
It's so negative,

549
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,800
just negativity.

550
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,439
Xin,

551
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,919
I have a suggestion:

552
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
don't overthink it.

553
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,320
I feel that

554
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,840
you are in

555
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,439
a poor state of mind.

556
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,800
Would you like

557
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,439
to see

558
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,919
a therapist?

559
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm not saying you're sick.

560
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,280
I can talk with you

561
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,159
for as long as you need,

562
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:15,840
but I think

563
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,280
you need

564
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,439
a professional

565
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,280
to help determine

566
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,399
whether you're

567
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,800
okay or if something

568
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,639
is wrong.

569
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,320
Will you come with me?

570
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,639
That's my girl.

571
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,479
Let me give you a hug.

572
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:49,679
It's okay.

573
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm here.

574
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:55,800
Everything will be fine.

575
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:30,320
After childbirth, women

576
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,959
experience changes.

577
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,560
When a new baby

578
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,719
joins the family,

579
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,879
you start having all sorts

580
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:36,760
of thoughts.

581
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,000
In such case...

582
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,639
I took Xin

583
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:06,520
to see a therapist.

584
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,879
The doctor said

585
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,439
she does have some issues.

586
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,000
Maybe she wasn't

587
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,479
ready mentally

588
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,080
for a second child,

589
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,479
but due to family expectations,

590
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,479
she still chose to have the child.

591
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,320
Those conflicting feelings

592
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,120
are battling

593
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,320
inside her,

594
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,360
making her

595
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,560
doubt everyone

596
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,800
around her,

597
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,439
even herself.

598
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,800
On top of that,

599
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,959
second-time moms don't get as much

600
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:01,719
attention

601
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,280
as first-time moms,

602
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,560
which led to a significant

603
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,600
psychological disparity for her.

604
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,800
I feel that since I had my second child,

605
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,280
my family

606
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,199
has distanced themselves from me.

607
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,399
It seems

608
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,439
they are unwilling to talk to me.

609
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,679
At home,

610
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,439
my husband,

611
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,360
my mother-in-law,

612
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:32,919
my dad, my mom,

613
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
and even the nanny ignored me.

614
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:38,280
It's strange.

615
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,199
At home,

616
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,719
they're all busy,

617
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,320
too busy.

618
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,199
But I,

619
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,040
I'm useless.

620
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:53,639
Sometimes,

621
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,560
they walked past me

622
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,800
as if I don't exist.

623
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,639
It was my fault.

624
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,520
I failed to offer her

625
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
more mental support and comfort

626
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,959
during that time,

627
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,080
and it made her sad.

628
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:29,120
She can get through this.

629
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,840
Families need to face tough times together.

630
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,679
I went on an outing a couple of days ago,

631
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:50,399
basking in the sunshine,

632
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,639
and embracing

633
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:52,679
nature.

634
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,360
Quite relaxing.

635
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:56,719
During that time,

636
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,239
my sister stayed with me,

637
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,479
comforting me.

638
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,719
Maybe opening up makes it

639
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,760
easier to accept others.

640
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
That's great.

641
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,679
Mom, I'm back!

642
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,560
Ying!

643
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,719
Haowen!

644
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,040
How is it? Did it pass?

645
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,560
Passed or not?

646
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,239
Check yourself.

647
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:07,600
Passed!

648
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,320
The partners' reaction

649
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,919
to investing in Blue Ocean was positive.

650
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,399
Congratulations, Mr. Yu.

651
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,320
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

652
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,199
I must thank you.

653
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,199
It's only because of your help

654
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,239
that I passed.

655
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:19,679
It wasn't me.

656
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,239
It was Yaohui and Mr. Zhou's

657
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,560
stellar reputation.

658
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,479
No,

659
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:26,600
before you came on board,

660
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,399
I was chasing Yaohui

661
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,439
for half a year.

662
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:31,239
Without your help,

663
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:32,199
my proposal

664
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,199
wouldn't have reached Mr. Zhou's desk.

665
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:35,840
Maybe it's because

666
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,879
I understand you

667
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,040
and Blue Ocean better.

668
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,840
But I must warn you

669
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
of the risks in advance.

670
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,679
Hold on,

671
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,120
let's talk about this some other time, okay?

672
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,760
What's wrong?

673
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,719
I have

674
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,159
to rush back to the office

675
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,399
for a transition meeting.

676
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,280
It's crucial.

677
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,439
I must go now.

678
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,239
Can we reschedule?

679
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:54,800
Maybe to another time.

680
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,439
We're just...

681
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,320
Sorry!

682
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
You two, hurry up!

683
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,760
It serves you right, Zhu Kexin!

684
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,320
You deserve it.

685
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,239
He Lu, don't say that.

686
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,479
She treated you like that,

687
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,360
yet you're still defending her?

688
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:19,360
She hurt me,

689
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,840
but I can't

690
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,879
kick her when she's down.

691
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:23,959
You claimed your mom is a saint.

692
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,679
I think

693
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,159
you're excessively kind, too.

694
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:27,560
I certainly am not.

695
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,919
Her notebook.

696
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,040
Return it to her.

697
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,239
Honey.

698
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,280
Welcome back.

699
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,719
Do you think I'm sincere

700
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,520
enough?

701
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,439
Absolutely.

702
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,959
We've agreed before

703
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,280
you'd help save my face.

704
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:58,959
Yunjie,

705
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,360
your mom bought you

706
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,840
lots of tasty treats.

707
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,080
Come and take a look.

708
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:07,679
Why did you buy them?

709
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,879
It may not

710
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,000
seem healthy,

711
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,040
but

712
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,280
sometimes,

713
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,600
we need it

714
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,319
to improve our moods,

715
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,040
right?

716
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,080
Mommy.

717
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,080
I thought you'd hug fried chicken.

718
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,159
See?

719
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,319
No grudges between mother and daughter.

720
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:27,880
Right?

721
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,719
Come on,

722
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,920
let's savor the fried chicken

723
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,120
while your aunt is away!

724
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,520
Zhu Kexin's father

725
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,440
not only neglects them

726
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,719
but even asks them for money.

727
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,199
How could

728
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,239
her father treat her

729
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,520
like this?

730
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,839
Exactly, so I can't

731
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:48,799
hold a grudge against her

732
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:49,679
anymore,

733
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,440
and He Lu won't call her

734
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,679
by nicknames any longer.

735
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,239
By comparison,

736
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:53,880
I feel

737
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
we're truly blessed.

738
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,279
But she gets good grades

739
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:58,639
even with all this.

740
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,319
Why do you always

741
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,080
bring up my scores?

742
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:02,880
And now you'll

743
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,920
link it to me, right?

744
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,279
You little genius,

745
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,560
can't you channel this genius...

746
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:08,920
into...

747
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,920
Into my studies?

748
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,239
I know you well.

749
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,199
Dad,

750
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,480
help me!

751
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,960
Dad.

752
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,600
What now?

753
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:19,639
Mom starts lecturing again.

754
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,279
Again?

755
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:21,120
I'm telling you,

756
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,520
you kids don't understand.

757
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,520
Don't dismiss

758
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,920
what adults say.

759
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,639
There's a song that goes,

760
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,920
"Listen to mom's words."

761
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,120
The baby's kicking, honey.

762
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,199
Kicking?

763
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:33,359
Where?

764
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,080
In my belly.

765
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
When did it start?

766
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,960
Just now.

767
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,520
It's the first time.

768
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,199
Why isn't it kicking?

769
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,319
Little Grape, kick for me.

770
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm your sister,

771
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,520
Come on, give it a kick.

772
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,319
Be good, kick.

773
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,080
It really works!

774
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:53,520
Right.

775
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,040
Kicking!

776
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,480
Here.

777
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,719
It's kicking!

778
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,400
Kicking!

779
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
Here, here!

780
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,679
Feel it, feel it.

781
00:35:59,239 --> 00:35:59,799
Put your hand here.

782
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:00,440
Here.

783
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,279
Right?

784
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,880
It's really kicking!

785
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,679
It's turning sideways.

786
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,480
No,

787
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,480
it's following

788
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,719
my words.

789
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,279
Yes... You're right.

790
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,520
So, make sure it behaves,

791
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,799
like your mom cares for Xin,

792
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:13,359
Got it?

793
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:13,799
Okay!

794
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,000
I can now give orders as well!

795
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,719
Little Grape,

796
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,000
focus all your attention

797
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
on your studies!

798
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,839
You hear me?

799
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,520
Really?

800
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,480
Yes, really.

801
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:27,759
I'm so happy!

802
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:28,719
Little Grape!

803
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,560
Yu Hai,

804
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,719
you booked the whole place again?

805
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,600
I really don't like

806
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,679
your random sense

807
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,560
of ceremony.

808
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,480
What a nice cake.

809
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,679
The kids will love it.

810
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,120
I'll take it back for them.

811
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,880
A token from their dad.

812
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,679
Thanks.

813
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:29,199
No need.

814
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,000
I've put the gifts

815
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,199
for the kids

816
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,639
into your car's trunk.

817
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,120
You've become thoughtful,

818
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,159
even remembering to buy gifts

819
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:36,960
for the kids.

820
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,000
I know. I know.

821
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,600
I know

822
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,960
I've been

823
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,960
terrible before.

824
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,679
Last year,

825
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,000
I wasn't able to get back

826
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,040
for their birthdays.

827
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,639
What do you mean by that?

828
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:48,319
Hinting that I'm not with the kids

829
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:49,839
for their birthday this year?

830
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,520
No,

831
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,199
no, no, no!

832
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:51,960
I wouldn't dare.

833
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,839
That's not what I meant.

834
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:53,359
Don't worry,

835
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,239
I've talked with them

836
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,520
about making up for it.

837
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:56,359
Then,

838
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,679
can I join in too?

839
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,040
I'd love to be part of it.

840
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:01,880
No problem.

841
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,040
I'll invite you,

842
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,359
but stop

843
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:05,480
with these gestures.

844
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,960
The kids have their own likes.

845
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,359
Okay.

846
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,839
But I think,

847
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,960
actually,

848
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,080
for the birthdays,

849
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,600
I think,

850
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,120
you are the one

851
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:24,520
who deserves

852
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,679
the most gratitude.

853
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,679
Take a look, please.

854
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,480
I'm just

855
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,719
a regular guy, right?

856
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,319
Will you ever stop?

857
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,279
Yes, yes.

858
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,080
Look at you,

859
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:35,960
you

860
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,520
gave me two daughters.

861
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,639
Their birthday

862
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,480
is your suffering day.

863
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,279
You suffered.

864
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,120
Take it.

865
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:47,960
Take it.

866
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,120
Thanks.

867
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,359
At least you didn't put it in the cake.

868
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,839
That'd be too tacky.

869
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,319
Even I couldn't stand that.

870
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,679
I've always known

871
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,040
you're better than me.

872
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,000
I've reflected a lot lately.

873
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,719
Deep down,

874
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,239
I realized

875
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,000
I was afraid

876
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,679
you would surpass me.

877
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:12,600
After you had the kids,

878
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,279
I wanted you to stay home,

879
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:15,679
to trap you there.

880
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,040
I didn't want you to work,

881
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,040
otherwise, I would lose

882
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,960
my place at home.

883
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,040
It's wrong.

884
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,279
I was so selfish.

885
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:22,960
I owe you an apology.

886
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,520
Apology accepted.

887
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,120
But our separation has

888
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,639
been good for us.

889
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,480
Right?

890
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:30,400
No, no, no.

891
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,239
You can't say that.

892
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,520
If I'm no longer selfish,

893
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,600
I mean,

894
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,239
if I've changed,

895
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:38,400
then we...

896
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,799
If you're really bored,

897
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,080
look over these files.

898
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
What's wrong with your eyes?

899
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm getting farsighted.

900
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,000
But your eyesight was

901
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,120
always good.

902
00:39:58,799 --> 00:39:59,239
Yeah,

903
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:00,600
the doctor said

904
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,359
people with good eyesight in their youth

905
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,440
are more prone to presbyopia

906
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,679
as they age.

907
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,359
In high school,

908
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,920
I even passed the pilot exam

909
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,319
with 20/20 vision.

910
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,040
Haowen!

911
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,440
Hotpot noodles.

912
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,839
Looks familiar, right?

913
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,080
Before,

914
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,839
we ate it almost every day

915
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,880
at the clothing market,

916
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,520
remember?

917
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,920
Stop reminiscing.

918
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,880
Haowen,

919
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,960
I was wrong.

920
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,000
Let's reconcile.

921
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,319
I won't act up anymore.

922
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:52,639
Let's live a good life.

923
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,480
okay?

924
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,920
I'm talking to you, Haowen.

925
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,239
Let's get a divorce.

926
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,319
Why?

927
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:07,639
You tell me.

928
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,440
Haowen, I was wrong.

929
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,120
I was wrong!

930
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,040
I really know my mistake!

931
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,000
I'll behave well from now on,

932
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,560
please.

933
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,880
I was too willful before.

934
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,199
I didn't care

935
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,480
about your feelings.

936
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:20,080
I took advantage

937
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
of your kindness.

938
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,960
That's all on me.

939
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,400
Forgive me, okay?

940
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,679
I've started seeing a therapist.

941
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,920
If I actively cooperate with treatment,

942
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,239
I'll get better.

943
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:30,040
Haowen, Hao...

944
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,319
Xu Mengxin,

945
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:44,080
a harmonious family is essential.

946
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,839
But you stir up trouble every day,

947
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,960
making it impossible for me

948
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,040
to focus on work.

949
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,199
I have to handle both the family

950
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,679
and work.

951
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,279
I barely had time

952
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:57,920
to breathe.
