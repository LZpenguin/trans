3
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,880
What would you say

4
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,199
my weak spot is

5
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,279
when it comes to

6
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,919
being a good investor?

7
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,120
You weak spot

8
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,719
is...

9
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,719
not having one.

10
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,079
Stop kidding me.

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,960
Your instinct for investment is spot on,

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,839
and you're investing in areas

13
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,320
that you're familiar with,

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,760
categories like baby care.

15
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,719
You're able to make

16
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,760
comprehensive and accurate judgements.

17
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,359
But to go from here,

18
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,199
you need to step into

19
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,079
a broader track of investments,

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,159
involve yourself in all kinds of projects,

21
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,960
and broaden your horizon.

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,319
Seems like I have a lot to catch up on.

23
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:22,599
Mr. Zhou,

24
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,719
if there're more occasions like this,

25
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,360
please bring me along with you.

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,159
No problem.

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,559
I have a couple more things

28
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,080
to tell you, Wendy.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
Aside from broadening your horizon,

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
you need to find your strength.

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,920
Give your best shot

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,640
at what you're best at.

33
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,879
One more thing,

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,520
don't be afraid of making mistakes.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,640
Have the courage to test things out.

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,759
Sometimes what you learn from mistakes

37
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,839
become valuable experience.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,039
Whatever goes wrong,

39
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:44,960
you have me behind you.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,759
Keep in mind,

41
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,480
behind every successful woman,

42
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,400
there is a man.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,879
And the man you have behind you

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,279
is me.

45
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,480
Cut the jokes.

46
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,159
That's the beat I want.

47
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,680
This is it.

48
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,800
They are doing an excellent job.

49
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,159
We'll work with them next time.

50
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:10,599
Good job.

51
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,279
No problem.

52
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,400
[Good job.]

53
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:13,920
[But]

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
[30 seconds?]

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,039
[Who can keep]

56
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,520
[the vibe going for 30 seconds?]

57
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,080
[No,]

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,879
[10 seconds at most.]

59
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,920
[In 10 seconds, we'll have them]

60
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,480
[completely warmed up and excited.]

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,120
[So we have to pack]

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,480
[the best parts]

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,800
[into the first 10 seconds,]

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,520
okay?

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,719
No problem.

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,279
No problem?

67
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,839
How does it feel to just sit back?

68
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,039
Honestly?

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,080
Yeah.

70
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,240
It's pretty nice.

71
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,080
You're living in your own world.

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
What do you want me to do then?

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,879
You're the director.

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,800
Do your job.

75
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,639
You can't be too optimistic.

76
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,480
What if something goes wrong?

77
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,079
It shouldn't.

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,360
I wanted to start

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,639
this project half a year ago.

80
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,120
The perspective is very original.

81
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,879
It doesn't involve any sensitive contents.

82
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,280
Even if you have Mu work on it,

83
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,319
it can't go wrong.

84
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
Not to mention her.

85
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,480
When this project gets going,

86
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,959
it'll, at least, last half a year.

87
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,120
In half a year,

88
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,399
my kid will be born.

89
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,840
That will be a smooth transition.

90
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,199
They say pregnancy leaves a woman dumb.

91
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,360
Is it true?

92
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,759
You're calling me dumb.

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm not saying you're dumb.

94
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm saying you can't just sit back.

95
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
Regarding the strategy,

96
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,879
talking is not enough.

97
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,480
We have to carry it out.

98
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,199
Did you forget

99
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,280
about our plan?

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,639
They're already on it.

101
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,480
It's already in action.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,120
They're already brought into the company.

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,079
If I don't sit back now,

104
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,160
when would I?

105
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,319
We had a deal that I could rest

106
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,439
for the baby here.

107
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,559
You become scheming.

108
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
It's called wisdom.

109
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,280
Haowen.

110
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,240
Lin.

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,439
What's up?

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,040
How did Little Watermelon's

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,680
hearing test go?

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,920
Don't panic.

115
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,600
Calm down.

116
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,800
Haowen, there's got to be a way.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,999
Sometimes the test... There...

118
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,319
must've been some mistakes.

119
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,680
We'll go to a different hospital.

120
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
We'll take the test again.

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,079
Maybe...

122
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,999
No, I think it'll definitely...

123
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,079
Lin,

124
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,319
can't you wish us something good?

125
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,079
Even though Little Watermelon

126
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,199
failed both tests,

127
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,559
we're doing great.

128
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,319
In addition,

129
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:20,879
my wife

130
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,759
has left the maternity hotel now.

131
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,559
We also got

132
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,639
an amazing nanny.

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,879
Everything's great

134
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,759
Her hearing is fine?

135
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,639
Of course.

136
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,280
It's normal?

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
Of course.

138
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,680
Congratulations. This is awesome

139
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,319
Haowen,

140
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,280
those days are finally over for you,

141
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,920
right?

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,600
How about this?

143
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,079
Haowen,

144
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,840
it's too late today,

145
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,680
but some other day,

146
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,360
I'll take you to a great place to eat.

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,280
No need for the courtesies between us.

148
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,639
I come here for this,

149
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,480
from Xin to her sister.

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,079
She had it when she was pregnant,

151
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,759
the supplements.

152
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,720
She said it'll be great for her,

153
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,639
for her pregnancy.

154
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,040
So here it is.

155
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,439
The good news

156
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,040
would've been enough.

157
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,280
There's no need to bring gifts.

158
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,120
Well, it's not for you.

159
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,840
You're not pregnant.

160
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,600
It's for Meng'an.

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,399
Okay,

162
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,879
thank you then.

163
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,360
Okay.

164
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,280
Lin, let me tell you,

165
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,639
Meng'an's pregnancy is stable now.

166
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,199
It's a relief.

167
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,040
You'll soon have a new kid, too.

168
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
You'll be just as happy as I am.

169
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,079
But I'm telling you,

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,800
you must be as cautious as I am.

171
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm very cautious.

172
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,240
I always keep your words in mind

173
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,759
as the truth.

174
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,319
"If there's a will, there's a way."

175
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Nope.

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
"Pretending to be timid keeps you safe."

177
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,840
Nope.

178
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,040
What else then?

179
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,079
Work hard and bear hardships.

180
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,559
That's no news.

181
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,720
I'm like

182
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
the hardest working man

183
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:27,840
himself.

184
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,120
We are the same,

185
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,879
Lin.

186
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,720
I'll leave you to it then.

187
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,360
Alright,

188
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
I'll get back to it.

189
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,280
It's been so hard for you...

190
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,399
Don't forget the gifts.

191
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,720
Okay, I got it.

192
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Bye, Lin.

193
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,920
Alright.

194
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,519
Okay.

195
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,639
Keep up the good work.

196
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,680
Hang in there.

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,680
Work hard and bear hardships.

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,480
You've had such a hard time

199
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,280
for the past months

200
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,439
It must've been overwhelming.

201
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,079
Our company focuses on

202
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,999
diagnostic equipment,

203
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:52,999
chemotherapy equipment,

204
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,160
and relevant training.

205
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,480
We hope we have

206
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,160
the chance

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,079
to see you often, Mr. Zhou.

208
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,559
Sure.

209
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,639
Thank you.

210
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,639
Mr. Zhou.

211
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,639
Mr. Yu.

212
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,040
Are you available now?

213
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,999
I'd like to talk about my project.

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,519
We have to confirm it

215
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,319
in the meeting this afternoon.

216
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,079
Sure, let's talk over there.

217
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,439
[The two project proposals I gave you,]

218
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,319
[you can start working on]

219
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,559
[gathering the basic information.]

220
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,480
[Pay special attention to their]

221
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,680
[funding source in the past two rounds.]

222
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
Okay, have it ready for me next Monday.

223
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,680
Mr. Yu, let me introduce.

224
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,040
[Mr. Zhou.]

225
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
This is our

226
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,840
Senior Investment Manager, Wendy.

227
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,280
Wendy,

228
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,360
this is Mr. Yu from Blue Ocean Media.

229
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,480
You know each other well.

230
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,720
Hello, Mr. Yu.

231
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,680
You work for

232
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,879
Mr. Zhou now?

233
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,519
Wendy is our

234
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,199
best investor,

235
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:39,559
as well as

236
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,799
a future partner of Yaohui.

237
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,519
Blue Ocean Media

238
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,600
has been working with us for a long time.

239
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,120
Wendy,

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,679
I think you are the best choice

241
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:47,879
for this project

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,480
Mr. Zhou, I think

243
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,320
it's better for me to withdraw.

244
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,840
No,

245
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
no one knows Mr. Yu

246
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,759
and Blue Ocean Media better than you.

247
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,480
I trust you,

248
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,639
as a professional investor,

249
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,799
you won't be

250
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,919
affected by your personal emotion.

251
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,560
I'm sure

252
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,999
you'll make the right

253
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
and unbiased judgement.

254
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,600
This is our project proposal,

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,240
Wendy.

256
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,519
I know about this project.

257
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,960
Mr. Yu,

258
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,080
I heard that your company just lost

259
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,999
your content director

260
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,120
and the core team.

261
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,639
Does it have any effects on you?

262
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,720
We are the biggest

263
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
media company

264
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,560
in Chunjiang City.

265
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,279
Slight alteration in personnel

266
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,759
won't affect our business.

267
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,360
I still need to

268
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,639
look into that.

269
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,679
I hope to have your cooperation.

270
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:35,840
You see,

271
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,480
I said you are the best choice,

272
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,879
you know about it more than anyone.

273
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,159
That's why

274
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,919
this project belongs to you.

275
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,279
That's it then.

276
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:44,960
I'll leave Blue Ocean to you.

277
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,039
Sure.

278
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,480
Since Mr. Zhou said the word,

279
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,720
I won't refuse.

280
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,600
Okay, that's it for business.

281
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,200
Since we all know each other well,

282
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,279
we can get together

283
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,240
once in a while.

284
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
Mr. Yu, do you play golf?

285
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,360
If you do,

286
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,480
let's practice together next week.

287
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,440
Sure, I do have a set of clubs.

288
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,879
Then I'll follow your schedule.

289
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,600
Great.

290
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Wendy, please arrange a time for us

291
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,519
next week.

292
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,360
Let's go together,

293
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,080
play some golf and chat about business.

294
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Okay.

295
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,919
Mrs. Li, you're so lucky.

296
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,560
Are you almost due?

297
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,879
In a few more months.

298
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm so jealous.

299
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,240
At my age,

300
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,519
there's no chance.

301
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,600
Why not?

302
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Have one if you can.

303
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,639
[My kid]

304
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,480
[is so easy to bring up.]

305
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,120
Easier said than done.

306
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm unable to do what I hope to do.

307
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,200
[My hands are full]

308
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
[with just one kid.]

309
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,639
[Don't overthink it.]

310
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,600
[It's not that much work.]

311
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,120
[Keep working on it.]

312
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:38,999
[Have another one.]

313
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,600
Here they come.

314
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,480
It's mock exam today.

315
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,120
Yeah.

316
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
I wonder how it goes.

317
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,759
It seems like it goes well.

318
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,639
Here's Wang Zhe.

319
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,480
Wang Zhe,

320
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,039
here.

321
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,999
How was your exam?

322
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,159
What do you think?

323
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,600
That's my son.

324
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,440
Excuse us.

325
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,360
Mr. and Mrs. Li,

326
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,159
Yunjie has to stay after school.

327
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,039
[Stay after school?]

328
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,560
[What happened, Lu?]

329
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
[After she eats,]

330
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,679
[put her on her left side,]

331
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,919
[or she might vomit.]

332
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,919
[Right.]

333
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,999
[Yeah, but the baby can't]

334
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,200
[just sleep on one side all the time.]

335
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,200
[The shape of her head]

336
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,080
[might be abnormal, right?]

337
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,679
[Right.]

338
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,919
[The head shape]

339
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,960
[is a big deal now.]

340
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,799
Yeah.

341
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,159
Yeah, we just wanted

342
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,639
her head to look nice.

343
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,639
Yeah.

344
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,120
But,

345
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,600
but the baby can turn over herself.

346
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
Just adjust her position

347
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
once in a while.

348
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,360
Turn her over.

349
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,240
Let me note it down.

350
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes, the left side.

351
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,080
Left side.

352
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,159
Looking after babies these days

353
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,639
are completely different from the past.

354
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,080
Yeah.

355
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,879
I have to write down what you said.

356
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,840
Yeah, write them down.

357
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,879
[Your baby]

358
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,279
[is so lucky to have]

359
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,519
[such a loving grandmother.]

360
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,399
Now that we have you,

361
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,440
I get nothing to worry about.

362
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,999
You're doing all the work.

363
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,840
I have to learn from you

364
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,799
the scientific and modern nursing.

365
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,159
Shanshan, teach me too.

366
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:07,759
Mrs. Jia,

367
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,600
maybe one day

368
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,639
I'll be working as a nanny.

369
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,720
Ask me whatever you want.

370
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,200
Okay.

371
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,279
Um...

372
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,600
inform shareholders about meeting tomorrow

373
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
and send me the revised blueprint.

374
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,679
I'll have a look tonight.

375
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,320
Alright.

376
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,120
[Okay.]

377
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,080
[Shanshan,]

378
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,399
[what you said...]

379
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,960
[Daddy's back.]

380
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,600
[My baby.]

381
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,759
[Daddy loves you.]

382
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,919
[Daddy loves you.]

383
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,560
Was she behaving well today?

384
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,679
She was so good.

385
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,080
She ate well and slept well,

386
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,279
such an angel.

387
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,159
[Yeah.]

388
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,240
[Shanshan did such a great job.]

389
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,279
She's got so much experience.

390
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,759
After we got Shanshan with us,

391
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,320
the baby hasn't puked once.

392
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,120
[Professionals]

393
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,399
[are different after all.]

394
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,360
Shanshan, thank you.

395
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,639
You did such a great job.

396
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,879
[It's such a relief for me]

397
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,120
[that you're here.]

398
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,960
[You are taking good care]

399
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,039
[of the three ladies.]

400
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,560
Yeah.

401
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,720
I don't have to worry at work,

402
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,080
right, mom?

403
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
That's right.

404
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,879
My mom speaks highly of you every day,

405
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,879
in every way possible.

406
00:12:59,159 --> 00:12:59,440
Thank you.

407
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,240
Thank you.

408
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,039
Shanshan is so great.

409
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:02,840
[Yeah.]

410
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,879
[Now that we have her,]

411
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,999
[I have]

412
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
nothing to worry about.

413
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,240
[She can cook]

414
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,639
[and has so much energy.]

415
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,200
[She's quick with her hands.]

416
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,720
Most importantly, she's good to our kid.

417
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:14,759
Have you seen her

418
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,120
holding Little Watermelon?

419
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,919
You can tell that

420
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,159
she really likes

421
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,999
Little Watermelon.

422
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah.

423
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
[Little Watermelon]

424
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,360
[is so lucky]

425
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:23,840
[Yeah.]

426
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,799
to have Shanshan,

427
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,120
such a good nanny,

428
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,600
right?

429
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,320
Lucky girl.

430
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:29,560
[She's laughing.]

431
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,879
It makes her happy.

432
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,879
Keep it down.

433
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,919
Don't scare her.

434
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,399
You're happy?

435
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,080
Is she laughing?

436
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,879
Yeah, she's laughing.

437
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,440
[She can recognize people now.]

438
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,720
[Yeah.]

439
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,799
Are we eating or what?

440
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,560
[She's so happy.]

441
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,240
Time to eat!

442
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,519
Xin,

443
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,999
I come back just to eat with you.

444
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,240
[Come on, let's go eat.]

445
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,039
Ms. Xue,

446
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,279
is there any

447
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,120
misunderstandings.

448
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,120
I know my daughter.

449
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,200
These notes can not be hers.

450
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,039
Ms. Xue,

451
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,560
even if my daughter fails a test,

452
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,360
she wouldn't do something like that.

453
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,919
But we all watched

454
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,039
the whole security footage.

455
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,840
The exam proctor

456
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,240
did find them in her desk.

457
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,799
We've all the evidence.

458
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,320
Yes,

459
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,999
in the footage,

460
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:31,799
the exam proctor

461
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,480
did find the notes

462
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,360
in Yunjie's desk,

463
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,919
but we didn't see

464
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,080
Yunjie

465
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,840
putting the notes there herself,

466
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,560
right?

467
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,560
Maybe it is her deskmate?

468
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,600
It can't be. Her deskmate

469
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,919
is the student leader of study.

470
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,639
Ms. Xue, that,

471
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,519
I also disagree with.

472
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,279
There's no guarantee that

473
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,480
the student leader of study

474
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,960
definitely won't cheat.

475
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,480
I agree.

476
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,279
I was the student leader of study,

477
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,399
and I was so scared

478
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,039
when we had exams.

479
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,440
Yeah.

480
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,919
But Zhu Kexin's grades

481
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,919
are top of the class.

482
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
I put her next to Yunjie

483
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,039
in order to

484
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,399
motivate Yunjie to study.

485
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,279
Ms. Xue,

486
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,360
you know,

487
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,279
you asked to see us

488
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,759
so we can resolve this.

489
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,399
Can we now

490
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,560
look closer into it?

491
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,679
Maybe it wasn't her deskmate.

492
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,200
Maybe those in front of or behind her?

493
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,960
Do you think you can

494
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,440
call their parents

495
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,919
and ask them

496
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,560
about the situation?

497
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,600
There could be a chance.

498
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,120
Yeah.

499
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
We need to look closer into it.

500
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,919
We can't wrong

501
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,600
an innocent child.

502
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,840
Okay, I'll make some calls.

503
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,039
What a big meal.

504
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,600
Mom,

505
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,519
this is great.

506
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,639
Xin,

507
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,879
mom made all these food

508
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,159
to help you recover.

509
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,120
Just eat more.

510
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,200
It's all thanks to you.

511
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,480
Shanshan made all these.

512
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,360
I can't cook them all.

513
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,080
[Shanshan]

514
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,960
[is so good at her job.]

515
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,919
[She's not only good at babysitting.]

516
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,360
[You see,]

517
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,320
[after the baby goes to sleep,]

518
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,999
[she goes on]

519
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,480
[to do the laundry, cook, and clean up.]

520
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
[What a great meal she made,]

521
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,480
much better than me.

522
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,840
I will ask Shanshan to be my teacher.

523
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,799
That's enough, mom.

524
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,999
Be your teacher.

525
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,999
Cooking takes talent.

526
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,159
It's about a feeling.

527
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,919
You should just sit back and enjoy.

528
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,399
Okay.

529
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,159
What do you think, Xin?

530
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,360
There's no taste at all.

531
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,360
And it's greasy.

532
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,519
It's terrible.

533
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,679
I'm done.

534
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,639
Mom,

535
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,320
there's really no salt in it?

536
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,480
She can't have any salt.

537
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,519
If she has any...

538
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,560
That's enough.

539
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,879
Everything is about producing milk.

540
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,159
How can you have it without salt?

541
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,960
Tastes like nothing.

542
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,120
You.

543
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,879
Ying,

544
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,440
bring the salt over.

545
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,039
You're really...

546
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,520
You've changed a lot.

547
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,879
I never change actually.

548
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,560
It's just

549
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,439
you didn't notice before.

550
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,600
Can you give me another chance?

551
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,639
Please talk about business.

552
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,639
Okay,

553
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,040
business.

554
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,000
Mr. Zhou Yao

555
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,360
is a leading figure

556
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,280
in the field of investment.

557
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,800
Blue Ocean

558
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,479
wants to make our transition,

559
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,360
and we need the support of Yaohui group.

560
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,439
It doesn't need to be a lot,

561
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,919
just to show

562
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:49,760
that Yaohui group

563
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,199
values

564
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,399
and supports Blue Ocean.

565
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,600
Are you afraid

566
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
that I might trip you up?

567
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,040
Don't worry.

568
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,040
I'm now a professional investor.

569
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,439
I will not be biased.

570
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,840
I will look into your company

571
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,800
and your projects.

572
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,360
Is there anything else?

573
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,800
If that's all,

574
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,199
please excuse me.

575
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,560
Your mom and I both trust you.

576
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,320
We know you didn't cheat.

577
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,080
You're a good kid.

578
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,679
Our daughter

579
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,080
never lies.

580
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,399
What're you doing?

581
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,320
I'm trying to think of evidence.

582
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,360
You can't think of evidence.

583
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,399
You have to find it.

584
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:47,040
Right now, say something.

585
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,600
Yunjie...

586
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,919
Ms, Xue.

587
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
I called

588
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,239
Zhu Kexin's mother.

589
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,479
Zhu Kexin admitted

590
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,919
that the notes were hers.

591
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,399
She heard that the proctor was coming,

592
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:58,879
so she tossed the notes

593
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,560
in Yunjie's drawer.

594
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,399
Zhu Kexin's mother

595
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:03,439
is on her way.

596
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,520
She'll be here soon.

597
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,399
I told you it wasn't me,

598
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,040
and you wouldn't believe me.

599
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:14,679
We believe you.

600
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:15,959
Your dad and I always believe you.

601
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:16,679
Ms. Xue

602
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,120
helped you clear it out,

603
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,800
right?

604
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
It was our negligence.

605
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,760
It's fine.

606
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,560
Thank you, Ms. Xue.

607
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,479
Mr. Li,

608
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,600
Mrs. Li,

609
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,120
Ms. Xue,

610
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,280
I got some drinks

611
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,080
for you.

612
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,840
This kid

613
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,560
got us drinks.

614
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:29,239
Okay, thank you.

615
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,040
Mrs. Li, please.

616
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,840
You, too.

617
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,840
Thank you.

618
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,760
Goodbye Mr. and Mrs. Li.

619
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,439
Goodbye Ms. Xue.

620
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:34,959
Okay.

621
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,479
Okay.

622
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
This is Mrs. Zhu.

623
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,320
Mrs. Li,

624
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,280
I'm so sorry.

625
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
Those notes,

626
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:45,239
Kexin admitted they were hers.

627
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,199
Ms. Xue said

628
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,439
Kexin's grades are not bad.

629
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,919
Why would she...?

630
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,719
She's afraid she can't surpass Wang Zhe,

631
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,040
so she went to the printing shop

632
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,080
and printed those out.

633
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:58,959
It's my fault, too.

634
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,800
I forced her.

635
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,280
I forced her to get first in the exam.

636
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,120
She's under so much pressure,

637
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,080
so she...

638
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,399
Li Yunjie,

639
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:12,479
you have been wronged.

640
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,159
It's my daughter's fault.

641
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,560
I apologize to you on her behalf.

642
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,239
Mrs. Zhu, it's okay.

643
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,800
You didn't do anything wrong.

644
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,040
It was Zhu Kexin

645
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,120
who made a bad mistake.

646
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,080
It should be her

647
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,239
apologizing to me.

648
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,120
She...

649
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,919
Mrs. Zhu,

650
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,040
maybe you should take them

651
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,959
to Kexin.

652
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,199
[Mr. Jia,]

653
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:47,000
[you're so good at it.]

654
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,439
[You know exactly what you're doing.]

655
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,719
[No, I'm not.]

656
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,719
[We weren't well off back then.]

657
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,159
[Xin just had the baby.]

658
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,800
[As the dad, I've got to step up.]

659
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,120
[I burped him, fed him at night,]

660
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,760
[gave him bath.]

661
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
[I had to do it all.]

662
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:00,919
[There was no other way.]

663
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,320
[It was difficult for the kid.]

664
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,239
[It was also difficult for Xin.]

665
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:03,719
[She was going through so much.]

666
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:04,719
[I couldn't let her do it.]

667
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,159
You're such a good husband,

668
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:07,840
a good father.

669
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:11,879
[Don't flatter me.]

670
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,280
I was so busy in the daytime.

671
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,600
I could only be with the baby at night.

672
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,840
Because I love you.

673
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,360
Really, the company

674
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,679
grew up with my child.

675
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:20,360
Here, let's

676
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,040
turn over.

677
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,959
Take it slow.

678
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,120
Such a

679
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,360
devoting father like you

680
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,000
is hard to find these days.

681
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,959
The truth is,

682
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,280
my conditions at first

683
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,879
weren't great.

684
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,120
I was not

685
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:33,439
that ambitious, either.

686
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,679
All I want

687
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,840
is a happy family with my wife and kids.

688
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,399
[I'll be home whenever I get the time.]

689
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,120
[Right?]

690
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:39,280
Right?

691
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
Be home for you.

692
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
If everyone's like you,

693
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,159
I won't have a job.

694
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,360
Shanshan, that's not true.

695
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,360
It's not the same thing.

696
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,320
We all play different roles.

697
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
I'm jealous of your job.

698
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,320
You're the boss of such a big company,

699
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,199
and you're still so busy?

700
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,879
What boss?

701
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,919
[Daddy is not a big boss.]

702
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,800
[Daddy works for the investors]

703
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,439
[to feed you.]

704
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,239
[Your job is great,]

705
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,040
[Shanshan.]

706
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,479
[What a pleasant job to]

707
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,760
[look after such a cute baby every day.]

708
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,399
Why put me in charge

709
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:19,120
of the project with Blue Ocean?

710
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,560
I find

711
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,520
it's better for me to withdraw.

712
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:25,479
You're not testing me, are you?

713
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,600
To see if I'm loyal to the company?

714
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,399
You've watched too much spy movies.

715
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:30,520
There's no need for that.

716
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,879
I put real money

717
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:32,879
in it.

718
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,959
Wendy,

719
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,000
you're overthinking it.

720
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,679
Why then?

721
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,479
I'm just curious.

722
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,120
Seeing you two today,

723
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,320
I think it is pretty funny.

724
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:46,280
Don't you think

725
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,040
being around your ex-husband

726
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,600
as who you're today

727
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,719
is quite satisfying?

728
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,360
Mr. Zhou, please don't put me in

729
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
any more of these occasions.

730
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,040
I can't satisfy

731
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,479
your curiosity.

732
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,479
I was just joking.

733
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,760
Actually, I did it

734
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,919
for a good reason.

735
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,399
I want you

736
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,919
to test

737
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,320
your own limit.

738
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,439
You know,

739
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,800
you and Yu Hai have an unusual relation.

740
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We can all understand that.

741
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,959
But as investors,

742
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,000
we have to deal with

743
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,439
complicated relationships like that,

744
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,600
to maintain,

745
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,840
clients,

746
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,479
investors,

747
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,199
and startup companies,

748
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,520
complicated relationships between them.

749
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,679
And I think

750
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,639
women

751
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,159
can deal with them better than men.

752
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Really?

753
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:27,560
Don't you think so?

754
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
Don't you want to try?

755
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,280
Prodding me into action?

756
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,159
You have what it takes.

757
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,199
Look,

758
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,399
you've balanced your family,

759
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,239
career planning, vocational learning

760
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,199
so well.

761
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:40,199
I hope, with this case,

762
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,080
through working with your ex-husband,

763
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,719
you can manage

764
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,040
the most difficult relation like it.

765
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,239
I need someone like that

766
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,280
as my career partner.

767
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,199
I've given you a task.

768
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,360
Here you go.

769
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,040
But it seems to me

770
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,600
that your divorce

771
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,879
was rather unpleasant.

772
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:11,399
If you can learn

773
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:13,760
to manage your relation,

774
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,399
I think

775
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:16,239
it'll be good

776
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,080
for your kids' growth

777
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,840
and for your

778
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,080
future career development.

779
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,719
It's true.

780
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,040
You're right.

781
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,879
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

782
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,280
I know you're taking care of me.

783
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,719
I'm also training you.

784
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:27,360
You're welcome.

785
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,040
Don't you think the wine today

786
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,120
has a peculiar taste?

787
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,399
Peat flavor.

788
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,639
No,

789
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:38,840
it's a bit straight.

790
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,040
What?

791
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,479
Is it?

792
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:46,360
Yeah, it's just like the straight face

793
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,280
when you are talking nonsense.

794
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,000
Kexin.

795
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,919
Let's go.

796
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:45,719
Why did you pull me away?

797
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:47,080
She didn't apologize yet.

798
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,239
But

799
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,959
you saw

800
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,159
how hard it is

801
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,280
for Zhu Kexin and her mother.

802
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,439
It is hard for them,

803
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,600
but is it easy for anyone these days?

804
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,600
Dad

805
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,439
was unemployed.

806
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,120
Still, our conditions

807
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,479
are much better.

808
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,520
Didn't you hear her on our way there?

809
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,360
She's a single mom right now.

810
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,840
So what?

811
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,800
Your logic is flawed.

812
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,439
Being unfortunate doesn't excuse you.

813
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,919
Ever since you were pregnant,

814
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,360
you've gotten a lot more unreasonable.

815
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
Watch your language, Yunjie.

816
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,199
I'm not wrong.

817
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,399
I just want

818
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:19,199
her apology.

819
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,000
Is that wrong?

820
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,120
Is that too much?

821
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,479
But I think

822
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,120
Yunjie's got a point too.

823
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,639
Well then...

824
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
Am I wrong?

825
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
My progesterone level is high right now.

826
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,679
I can't see them crying there,

827
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:33,399
okay?

828
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,399
It was obvious

829
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:36,439
that Zhu Kexin knew

830
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,040
that she made a mistake.

831
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,520
What else do you want from her?

832
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:41,000
Enough is enough.

833
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,439
What do you want?

834
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,399
You're old enough

835
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:48,040
Can't you learn to be more forgiving?

836
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,959
Am I wrong?

837
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,479
Honey,

838
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,280
I love you honey.

839
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,120
You work so hard.

840
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,800
You've done the most

841
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,360
for our family.

842
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,679
You went through so much

843
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,280
to bring that kid

844
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,760
into the world.

845
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,600
You had to have a C-section.

846
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,280
The cut

847
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,600
went into you,

848
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,959
but it hurt me, too.

849
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:05,239
I should've charged in there

850
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,080
and taken it for you.

851
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,080
I felt so terrible, honey.

852
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,639
I felt so terrible.

853
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,040
You've gone through so much, honey.

854
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,639
My sweetheart.

855
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,320
Go away.

856
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,560
Honey, how can I go?

857
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,040
Where can I go?

858
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,840
I can only be next to you,

859
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,080
by your feet,

860
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,639
fall for your beauty,

861
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:26,320
honey.

862
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,760
There's no guarantee

863
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,000
who you'll be with.

864
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,399
Honey,

865
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,840
that's really not true.

866
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,840
Listen to me,

867
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,520
every single moment,

868
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,280
I'm thinking of you.

869
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,520
I think of you when I drive,

870
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,239
when I work,

871
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,919
when I eat.

872
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,919
Honey,

873
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm so lonely

874
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,080
without you.

875
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,159
Honey,

876
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,399
I passed by

877
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:56,879
a silk store today

878
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:57,479
and saw

879
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,239
a gorgeous kerchief.

880
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,399
I took it out

881
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,360
and knew that this kerchief

882
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,239
would look better

883
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,159
on my wife

884
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,080
than anyone else in the world.

885
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,120
It's just a kerchief.

886
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,239
Stop it.

887
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
Your gifts before I had the baby

888
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
were much better than a kerchief.

889
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,600
The thought behind it really counts.

890
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,320
Honey,

891
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,320
I've sinned.

892
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,280
This is my fault.

893
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,879
It's been

894
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:27,840
so many days

895
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,760
since our baby's birth.

896
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,879
I didn't think of

897
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:30,919
a decent gift for you.

898
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,360
I'm so sorry, honey.

899
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,199
This is completely

900
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,320
my fault.

901
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,360
It's my fault.

902
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,280
Let me make up

903
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,080
for my sins.

904
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,560
I have a magic trick to show you.

905
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,399
It'll definitely

906
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:40,120
make you laugh.

907
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:40,800
Honey, look.

908
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,679
Look.

909
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,600
I learned a magic trick, look.

910
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,639
Blow on it.

911
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,959
Blow on it.

912
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:53,719
Do you like it?

913
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,280
I love you.

914
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,639
It'll look gorgeous on you.

915
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:04,719
Do you like it?

916
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,000
Actually,

917
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,120
I don't want anything right now.

918
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:14,639
I just want to be on my own,

919
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:15,959
take some time off somewhere,

920
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,520
lie on the beach,

921
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,199
no more feeding at night,

922
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,000
no more distress over the baby,

923
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:25,879
no more being around the family.

924
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,239
Easy.

925
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:29,199
Got it.

926
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,760
That's all?

927
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,280
It's too easy.

928
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,639
When our child gets a bit older.

929
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,120
The four of us,

930
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,040
we'll go to the beach.

931
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
We'll go see the blue ocean,

932
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,719
feel the breeze,

933
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,280
watch sunrise over the sea.

934
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,399
We watch the beach,

935
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,120
go surfing with the kids,

936
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,679
enjoy sunbath with my wife

937
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,919
and our nephew and niece,

938
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,959
and our parents.

939
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:25,719
What a happy family I have.

940
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:27,520
What

941
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,600
did I, Jia Haowen, do

942
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,879
to deserve this?

943
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,399
My sweetheart,

944
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,800
the ocean,

945
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,520
the waves,

946
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,080
seabirds

947
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:41,879
flying

948
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:43,760
over the water.

949
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,239
So beautiful.

950
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,600
[Hold it yourself.]

951
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,280
Hold it yourself.

952
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:28,479
Daddy loves you.

953
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,280
Baby.

954
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,360
Look.

955
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,679
Okay.

956
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,360
Here, hold one yourself.

957
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,959
Touch it.

958
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,040
She's a little upset.

959
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,439
Baby.

960
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,000
Jia Haowen!

961
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,760
I'm here.

962
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:01,560
What's wrong, honey?

963
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,320
Where's Little Watermelon?

964
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,479
You scared me, honey.

965
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,520
She's with the nanny.

966
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,280
How will I feed her at night?

967
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,600
It's fine, honey.

968
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:12,199
There's still some breast milk

969
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:12,879
in the fridge.

970
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:13,520
If it's not enough,

971
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,120
Shanshan will give her some milk powder.

972
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:17,040
But what if Shanshan

973
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,760
does something bad to her?

974
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
Honey, don't worry.

975
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,399
There're cameras.

976
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,000
What's more,

977
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:25,080
mom is with them.

978
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Don't worry.

979
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,159
Honey,

980
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,360
I really think

981
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,320
you need

982
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:33,360
a good sleep.

983
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:33,959
Really

984
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,959
It's been so hard on you.

985
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,520
You see,

986
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,320
before we had Little Watermelon,

987
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,639
as soon as there's

988
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:41,479
one single wrinkle on your forehead,

989
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,760
you'll be going to the beauty salon.

990
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,879
You looked great.

991
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:44,600
And now,

992
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,000
you haven't been out for days,

993
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,120
never go downstairs,

994
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,840
right?

995
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,639
Right?

996
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:49,719
Why would I go down?

997
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,000
Who should I go out with?

998
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:52,479
My hands are full with the baby.

999
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,879
Jia Haowen,

1000
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:59,159
you think I'm not pretty anymore?

1001
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:00,840
Honey,

1002
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,360
I wouldn't dare.

1003
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,719
Honey,

1004
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:06,959
honey, look,

1005
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,479
we have a nanny now,

1006
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,040
right?

1007
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,360
She's not bad.

1008
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,639
Little Watermelon is healthy

1009
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,120
and strong.

1010
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,080
So I think

1011
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,199
you should take a break

1012
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,159
and love yourself.

1013
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,279
Honey,

1014
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,199
have a good sleep tonight.

1015
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,040
Don't worry about anything else.

1016
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,400
When you wake up, don't worry about her.

1017
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,040
I have meetings the whole day tomorrow.

1018
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,400
I'll pick you up when I'm done.

1019
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:28,480
It's been a while since our last date.

1020
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:29,920
I've made a reservation

1021
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,199
for a candlelight dinner,

1022
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,199
just the two of us.

1023
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,319
Are you happy?

1024
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,639
That's great.

1025
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,600
Wendy,

1026
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,279
Mr. Yu is waiting for you upstairs.

1027
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,159
Mr. Yu.

1028
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:22,960
Mr. Yu,

1029
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,159
we're here.

1030
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:24,920
Let's get started.

1031
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,759
I've been waiting

1032
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,920
for this moment for a long time.

1033
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:28,719
Please.

1034
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,000
This is last week's

1035
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,159
user analysis report.

1036
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,120
The user conversion rate is so high.

1037
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,080
And most importantly,

1038
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,359
there are a lot of

1039
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,880
registered and active new users.

1040
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,199
In fact,

1041
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,120
the outsourcing team

1042
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,960
has had some great results

1043
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,199
through their work

1044
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,480
and recent small-scale tests.

1045
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,040
Okay.

1046
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,000
That is to say

1047
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,120
this team is good.

1048
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,279
Ms. Huang,

1049
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,440
you have a great team.

1050
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,440
That's it from me.

1051
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,000
Ms. Xu,

1052
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,839
do you have anything to add?

1053
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:00,440
No.

1054
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,040
That's it then.

1055
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:05,600
Ms. Huang,

1056
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,199
can you send me a copy

1057
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,719
of your summary report?

1058
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,000
I didn't get your email.

1059
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm sorry. I forget it.

1060
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,679
I'll do it right away.

1061
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,279
And

1062
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,719
if you don't mind me asking,

1063
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,159
how can you acquire

1064
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,199
the user information

1065
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,719
of the new users?

1066
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,839
Ms. Xu,

1067
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,719
that's a commercial secret

1068
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that must remain confidential.

1069
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,400
You're at the top.

1070
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,199
As long as the results are good,

1071
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,080
leave the hard work to us.

1072
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,359
You can just

1073
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
focus on your baby.

1074
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,679
Take it easy.

1075
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,239
Blue Ocean is one of the earliest

1076
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,600
media companies in Chunjiang,

1077
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,719
with the largest share of the market.

1078
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,960
The founder, Yu Hai,

1079
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,159
is a pretty famous

1080
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,080
local media specialist.

1081
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:03,799
He used to work

1082
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:04,920
in traditional media advertising,

1083
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,839
has incredible

1084
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,639
revenue capacity and industry resources.

1085
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,480
Professionally speaking,

1086
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,120
he is a very capable and experienced

1087
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,040
leader of new media, as well as the

1088
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,639
actual controller of Blue Ocean.

1089
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,480
Now,

1090
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,639
let's welcome Mr. Yu to give

1091
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,920
an introduction of the company.

1092
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,279
Okay, Wendy.

1093
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,639
Don't bend over.

1094
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,120
What are you looking for? I'll get it.

1095
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,159
I want to see

1096
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,480
the industry report of the last year.

1097
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,159
It should be

1098
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,400
in one of these two boxes.

1099
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,920
I've rummaged this one. It's not there.

1100
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
It should be in a plastic folder.

1101
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,440
That's it.

1102
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,000
This one.

1103
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,080
How did you get them down?

1104
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,520
They are so heavy.

1105
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,520
Are you in such a hurry?

1106
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,880
You can't wait for me to do it?

1107
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,319
Blue Ocean also has made a big increase

1108
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:34,400
in user statistics earlier this year.

1109
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,239
It seems like Huang Sisi

1110
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,159
is confident to make her promises,

1111
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,600
because she's made it before.

1112
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,520
So that means

1113
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,040
she is really capable.

1114
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Do you know

1115
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,239
how she does it?

1116
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,040
No.

1117
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,040
An increase in the statistics

1118
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,239
is expected due to the project.

1119
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,639
But now,

1120
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,719
to such an extent,

1121
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,199
this is way beyond my expectation.

1122
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,120
If she's really that good,

1123
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:04,520
Blue Ocean would never let her go.

1124
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,839
She had other reasons

1125
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,159
leaving Blue Ocean.

1126
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,040
The biggest question I have

1127
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,759
is that if she's so capable

1128
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,120
to maintain so many users,

1129
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,040
In the past several years, Blue Ocean

1130
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,080
should've been much better than us.

1131
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,120
That's definitely not true.

1132
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,520
I heard

1133
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:24,679
Mr. Yu of Blue Ocean

1134
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,480
is diluting his equity,

1135
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,960
raising funds everywhere.

1136
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,560
That's a good point.

1137
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,639
I should give Yu Hai a call.

1138
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,400
Hello, Mr. Yu,

1139
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,239
are you available now?

1140
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,239
[Ms. Xu,]

1141
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,279
I'm waiting on a call.

1142
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:46,520
Go ahead and make it short.

1143
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,960
I'm reading

1144
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,000
the industry report.

1145
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,159
Blue Ocean

1146
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,600
had a big increase in users

1147
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,560
in first half of the year.

1148
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,199
I just want to ask

1149
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,759
about the quality

1150
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,520
of the new users.

1151
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:00,880
Were they active users?

1152
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,120
Half a year ago?

1153
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,080
Did Huang Sisi

1154
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,199
join your company

1155
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,120
and made some great numbers?

1156
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,199
The secrets to boost online traffic?

1157
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,440
Is there anything

1158
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,359
you can disclose to me,

1159
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,400
my old friend?

1160
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,400
Ms. Xu,

1161
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,279
don't pull that with me.

1162
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,040
When you need something from me,

1163
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,759
it's old friends

1164
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:22,120
and good friends all over the time.

1165
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,199
But when you don't,

1166
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,639
I'm just Mr. Yu.

1167
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,000
Then what do you

1168
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,960
want me to call you?

1169
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,679
[Come on,]

1170
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:30,279
[give me something.]

1171
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,920
I can't.

1172
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,279
This is a commercial secret.

1173
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:35,080
Commercial secret?

1174
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,319
Then tell me,

1175
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,359
her way to do this,

1176
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,719
did it come from you

1177
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,040
or Huang Sisi?

1178
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,159
From her?

1179
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,400
What she knows,

1180
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,639
she learned everything

1181
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,359
from Blue Ocean.

1182
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,199
There's no need for me to tell you.

1183
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,639
You'll know soon yourself.

1184
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,080
Just tell me then.

1185
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,359
No, it's that I'm afraid

1186
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:51,799
that it'll affect

1187
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:52,880
the image you have of me.

1188
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,400
What image

1189
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,920
do you think you have?

1190
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,159
What's that tone?

1191
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,120
Do you want to know

1192
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,279
or not?

1193
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,839
[But I'm afraid]

1194
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:04,400
[that someone like you,]

1195
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,000
[with such a]

1196
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,480
[sense of responsibility for the society,]

1197
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,799
with sense of justice,

1198
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:08,679
as a media person,

1199
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,600
wouldn't accept

1200
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,400
this secret to boost online traffic.

1201
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:13,719
What do you mean?

1202
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,440
Putting me on a pedestal?

1203
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,400
Cut the nonsense

1204
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,080
and tell me.

1205
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,679
My call is coming in.

1206
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,319
That's it for now.

1207
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:21,920
Hello?

1208
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,560
What?

1209
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:26,759
He hung up on me.

1210
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,319
He didn't tell you?

1211
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,159
It seems to be

1212
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,560
a secret that can't be spoken of.

1213
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,480
It's looks great on you.

1214
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,040
Mrs. Jia, I can't take this.

1215
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:29,639
Keep it, you have to.

1216
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:30,759
Shanshan,

1217
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:31,920
ever since we hired you,

1218
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,040
our house became so clean and neat.

1219
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,080
I have to thank you.

1220
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:36,960
It looks great.

1221
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,520
It looks great.

1222
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,279
Mrs. Jia,

1223
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,199
making you satisfied

1224
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,679
is my job.

1225
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:42,639
This kerchief is too big a gift.

1226
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,359
I really can't accept it, Mrs. Jia.

1227
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:46,040
You must keep it.

1228
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,679
Shanshan, look,

1229
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,159
at my age,

1230
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,639
this color

1231
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,319
is too light on me.

1232
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,040
I can't wear it.

1233
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
It's perfect on you.

1234
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,440
It really looks great.

1235
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,719
Am I right, Ying?

1236
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,639
Yeah.

1237
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,319
This color

1238
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,440
really suits your skin tone.

1239
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,279
It looks great.

1240
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:01,120
Keep it.

1241
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,960
It's great. Keep it.

1242
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,080
Mrs. Jia, you're very nice.

1243
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,759
I'm not. It really looks great.

1244
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,400
This is to thank you.

1245
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,040
Look at you.

1246
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,480
Mrs. Jia.

1247
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,239
It looks great.

1248
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:07,639
Yeah.

1249
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,600
It really looks great.

1250
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,440
Really?

1251
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,080
Yeah.

1252
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:11,639
Even the baby thinks so.

1253
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,120
It looks great.

1254
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,719
[It's yours.]

1255
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:13,759
[Keep it.]

1256
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,080
[Mrs. Jia, you're too nice.]
