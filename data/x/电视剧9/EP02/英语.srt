3
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,359
Have you decided to confess to me?

4
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,160
About what?

5
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,479
So you know all this?

6
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,320
I was planning to confess everything.

7
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,999
You'd receive a lighter sentence.

8
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,400
I see.

9
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:34,999
Actually,

10
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,680
I was planning to be honest,

11
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,480
but I didn't find a chance.

12
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,879
Until this morning

13
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,520
when I heard that career course,

14
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,439
I was very touched,

15
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
and they were quite right.

16
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,439
The competition within the industry

17
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,960
is too fierce now,

18
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,159
so I plan to

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,839
go on a business trip to Beijing.

20
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,680
Who will you meet with?

21
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,960
Just a conference within the industry.

22
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,439
I'm not going to see someone.

23
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,640
It's beneficial for me

24
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,439
to expand my network

25
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,400
by meeting

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,599
more people, right?

27
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,159
Just a conference?

28
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,520
This is the invitation letter.

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,879
Take a look.

30
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,279
[You were right.]

31
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm not trying hard enough.

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,759
I'm in my forties now,

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,920
and I can't go on like this anymore.

34
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,640
At this moment,

35
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
I should roll up my sleeves

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
and work hard.

37
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,759
Why didn't I hear that

38
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,400
you were going to attend

39
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,640
a conference before?

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
I just

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,839
didn't understand this before

42
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,559
and wasn't proactive about it.

43
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,640
I mean...

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,520
It's okay not to go to this conference.

45
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,360
There are many other ways.

46
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,640
Let me think about it.

47
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,120
I'll come up with a plan.

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,759
Oh, you have to think carefully.

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,759
Deliberately concealing

50
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
and refusing to confess

51
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,240
can have serious consequences.

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,200
Darling,

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,559
as for my job...

54
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
What's wrong with your job?

55
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,719
Is there a problem?

56
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,960
Did you fight with a colleague?

57
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:26,800
No.

58
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:27,800
Have you been criticized by your boss?

59
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:28,520
Not at all.

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,520
Really?

61
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah.

62
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,920
The job's going well.

63
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,159
What are you worried about?

64
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah,

65
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,559
I don't need to worry.

66
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,800
Nothing.

67
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,959
It's okay.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Nothing.

69
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Go to sleep.

70
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,480
Well,

71
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,319
okay,

72
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,759
it's time for bed.

73
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,439
Good night.

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,439

led by Professor Shang,

78
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,639
has been officially launched.

79
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,040
It is worth celebrating that

80
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,160
we sold over 7000 classes

81
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
within 48 hours of our launch,

82
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,399
and the development costs

83
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
have been recouped.

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,920
This afternoon,

85
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,319
we will have a live broadcast

86
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,639
with Professor Shang

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
to sell courses online

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,800
and strive to achieve

89
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
our profit goals.

90
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,840
Guys,

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
you should learn from Meng'an.

92
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,759
We all know

93
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,840
the current situation of the company,

94
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
so I won't say much about it.

95
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,280
Projects like this,

96
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,360
with low investment

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,519
and short monetization cycle,

98
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,480
are worth promoting.

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,480
I think this kind of project

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,879
is worth continuing.

101
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,319
So we have started preparing for

102
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,759

for the next quarter.

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,639
I'll make appropriate arrangements

105
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,879
regarding manpower.

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,319

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,680
Excuse me.

110
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,959
Stop!

111

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,079
[Stop! I am not!]

114
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,559
She's running away.

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Hello, Ms. Xue?

116
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,720
Ms. Xu,

117

are you free now?

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,759
Can you come to school?

119
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,160
Now?

120
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,160
Is it about the advances to her?

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,559

her daily affairs.

123
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,360
But I think

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,280
we still need to

125
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,040
communicate with you about this.

126
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,680
After all, she's a girl.

127
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,600
Oh, I see.

128
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,600
I'll go over now.

129
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,280
What's the fuss for?

130
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,079
Mu?

131
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,360
I have something to go out for.

132
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,840

I'm sorry,

139

I'm just too excited to win.

140
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,319
I'm sorry to

141
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,759
have implicated you.

142
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,680
Can you not show off?

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,399
OK.

144
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,600
Since you don't like this way,

145
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,160
next time

146
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll try a different way.

147
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,920
Save it.

148
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,680
Can you stop doing stupid things?

149
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,840
No wonder people say

150
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,079
you have more brawn than brain.

151
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,360
They were jealous of me!

152
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,559
I won the championship this time,

153
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,759
and I can choose

154
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,720
any high school in the city.

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,639
Which one you want to go to?

156
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,879
I want...

157
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,240
I would choose the same one as you.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,280
Why on earth do you like me?

159
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
I can make changes.

160
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,360
How can you say that?

161
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,519
Sorry,

162
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,960

163
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,159

00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,679
Where is he?

180
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,840
Professor Shang?

181
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,879
[OK, listen,]

182
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:48,720
[I'm talking to Ms. Xue now,]

183
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,759
and I'll call you back later.

184
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,240
Sorry for that.

185
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
As elementary school classmates,

186
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,799
Liu Siming and Li Yunjie

187
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,080
have been close,

188
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,120
and Li Yunjie is quite helpful

189
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,159
and caring

190
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,039
to Liu Siming.

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm not!

192
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,159
I didn't care about him,

193
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,120
nor did I help him.

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,999
Yunjie,

195
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,200
it's normal for classmates

196
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,799
to care about each other.

197
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,120
I really don't.

198
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
Mind your manners.

199
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,639
Ms. Xu,

200
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,480
Ms. Xue,

201
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,360
this is all my fault

202
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,320
[and has nothing to do with her.]

203
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,519
She bothers me,

204
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,919
really.

205
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,159
Maybe it's not true.

206
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,320
Ms. Xu,

207
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,120
are you busy now?

208
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,720
Now it's in silent mode.

209
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,440
Liu Siming,

210
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,999
you don't have to

211
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,200
[blame yourself for everything.]

212
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,120
The children in our class

213
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,840
are quite simple and positive.

214
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,279
[Siming and Yunjie]

215
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,519
[are both]

216
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,639
[good children,]

217
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,200
[however,]

218
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,919
[as students,]

219
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,799
[your only task at this stage]

220
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,999
is to study for the

221
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,759
high school entrance examination.

222
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,999
Right?

223
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,480
[Ms. Xu?]

224
00:10:59,639 --> 00:10:59,960
Yes.

225
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,320
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,679
Yes.

227
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:01,360
Right.

228
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,279
Yeah.

229
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
It's actually not a big deal.

230
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,960
Because of this incident,

231
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,759
the school asked me to

232
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
explain the situation to you.

233
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,039
You don't need to

234
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,519
care about that video either.

235
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:14,919
[Just]

236
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,240
[adjust your mindset,]

237
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
[focus on studying,]

238
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,399
and not be distracted

239
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,200
by other opinions.

240
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,279
We can rest assured that

241
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,399
the school is so strict

242
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,679
and responsible.

243
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,720
We are very assured.

244
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,279
Right.

245
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,399
Not quite.

246
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Education requires

247
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,999
joint efforts

248
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,279
from parents and schools.

249
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,080
[In case of an accident,]

250
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,799
the school will be

251
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,999
held responsible.

252
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,440
Got an emergency.

253
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,360
One minute, please.

254
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,840
OK.

255
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,399
One minute.

256
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:45,440
Hello?

257
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,360
If you can't find him,

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,960
just withdraw the plan first.

259
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,480
[Wait until I go back]

260
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,799
and don't call me again,

261
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,440
okay?

262
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,320
OK.

263
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,240
Well,

264
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,279
since both of you

265
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,519
are aware of the situation,

266
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:06,840
I won't

267
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,440
take up your time.

268
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,360
Alright.

269
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,440
The examination is approaching,

270
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,399
and studying is not

271
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,159
solely the responsibility of the child.

272
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,600
Parents should put in more effort

273
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,919
at home,

274
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,360
okay?

275
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,999
Sure.

276
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:19,840
Alright.

277
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,039
Thank you.

278
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,960
Thank you.

279
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,799
Goodbye.

280
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:35,120
Is there a teacher

281
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,720
surnamed Shang here?

282
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,200
I have no idea.

283
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,399
I just praised you in the morning,

284
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,960
and in the afternoon came the seizure!

285
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,240
More than 7000 classes

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,080
worth over 2 million yuan,

287
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,919
what about the after-sales services?

288
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,879
What about compensation?

289
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,120
Who conducted the risk assessment?

290
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,639
Xu Meng'an!

291
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,360
Where is she?

292
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,879
Tell me!

293
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,039
She went to see Ms. Xue.

294
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,200
Who is this again?

295
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,799
It must be a substitute.

296
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,919
No wonder she is the director.

297
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,799
She must have anticipated that,

298
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,480
so she found a substitute in advance,

299
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,879
right, Mu?

300
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,399
Yes.

301
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Don't cover for her.

302
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,360
Tell her to see me later.

303
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,519
Who is Ms. Xue?

304
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,399
[Your act today is not appropriate.]

305
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,879
[After all, the teacher is talking to you.]

306
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,759
It's inappropriate.

307
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,879
There is an emergency situation

308
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,080
at work.

309
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:37,999
Is that serious?

310
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,279
Nothing.

311
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,519
Well,

312
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,360
what did you think about

313
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,440
the teacher's conversation today?

314
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,399
It's not a big deal.

315
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,480
Someone likes my daughter,

316
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,639
which is good.

317
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,159
It shows that my daughter is excellent.

318
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,279
But puppy love is not allowed.

319
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,039
That's for sure.

320
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,480
I don't like him anyway.

321
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,799
He's not that outstanding.

322
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,919
Mainly because you're too young.

323
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,999
Yes.

324
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,759
I can't go home

325
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:04,720
for dinner tonight.

326
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,039
Why don't you go out with your dad?

327
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,039
My dad?

328
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,120
Didn't he go to Beijing?

329
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,639
When?

330
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,759
Don't you know?

331
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,560
Oh, maybe I forgot.

332
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,320
I'll go to my grandmother's house.

333
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,519
Sure.

334
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,279
OK.

335
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,679
I won't be going home tonight.

336
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,560
It's okay.

337
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,360
Send me a message

338
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,080
when you arrive.

339
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,720
OK.

340
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,240
I have to go.

341
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:26,999
Go ahead.

342
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,639
Bye, mom.

343
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,279
He Lu!

344
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,320
My mom didn't criticize me.

345
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:41,919
See?

346
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,759
Look how fast my mom runs.

347
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,440
Her physical fitness is good.

348
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,120
What did your mom say?

349
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,679
She told me

350
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,759
puppy love is not allowed.

351
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,679
Especially He Lu,

352
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,320
no puppy love!

353
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,999
Nonsense.

354
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,159
Yiduo,

355
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
it's been a long time.

356
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Let's gather together

357
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,200
this time

358
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,480
and catch up.

359
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,720
Give me a chance.

360
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,720
Too straightforward

361
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,519
and impolite.

362
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,039
Yiduo.

363
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,879
No need to bow.

364
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,440
Whatever.

365
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
It's been a while.

366
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,960
Yeah.

367
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,759
The last time we met

368
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
was at the decade alumni association.

369
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,080
Oh, yeah.

370
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,600
It's been ten years.

371
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,840
Time flies.

372
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,720
How are you doing?

373
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,080
Everything's fine with me.

374
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
It's great that

375
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,999
we can meet together

376
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,919
and recall

377
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,399
the past.

378
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,960
Besides,

379
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
I actually want to...

380
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,560
How to put it?

381
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:11,639
Well,

382
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:12,560
let me see,

383
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:13,840
if you are...

384
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,279
I want to...

385
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,039
Mei Yiduo?

386
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,919
Do you remember me?

387
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,399
I'm Zhao.

388
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,320
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Jia.

389
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,240
Sure.

390
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,480
We met at a conference

391
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,960
in the US.

392
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,480
Yes.

393
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:25,999
That's right.

394
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:26,279
Yeah.

395
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,999
Please sit down.

396
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:27,879
OK.

397
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,159
Professor Mei,

398
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,080
with the current favorable

399
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,799
research environment at home,

400
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,519
have you ever considered

401
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,200
returning to your home country

402
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,519
for development?

403
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,440
[Oh, sure.]

404
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,799
Especially when I came back this time,

405
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,519
I found that

406
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,960
the research environment

407
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
is really good.

408
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,759
It seems that I really need to

409
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,200
plan carefully.

410
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,519
Let me introduce to you,

411
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,679
my senior schoolmate, Li Lin,

412
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,799
of the same industry.

413
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,720
I will have to rely on his care

414
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,919
if I want to return.

415
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:51,960
Nice to meet you.

416
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,879
Are you Li Lin?

417
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,560
The top student!

418
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Yes.

419
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,799
I admired you very much

420
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,879
when I was in school.

421
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,320
Oh, I'm too flattered.

422
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,440
Li Lin,

423
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,639
you must attend

424
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,759
tonight's party.

425
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,039
Oh, I don't...

426
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,519
Lin.

427
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:05,840
Come together.

428
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,679
Come with us.

429
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,080
Let's exchange business cards.

430
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,840
Professor Mei,

431
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,039
the meeting is about to begin.

432
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,240
OK. Let's go.

433
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,799
Alright.

434
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,480
Come on, Lin.

435
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,799
OK.

436
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,200
Let's go.

437
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,759
Okay.

438
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,120
Ms. Mei,

439
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:17,600
nice to see you again.

440
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,720
It's really unlucky.

441
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,600
Many days of overtime have been in vain.

442
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,759
Stop complaining.

443
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:27,720
Lin,

444
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,240
have you finished the poster?

445
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,200
Why? It won't go online anyway.

446
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
Whatever. I won't do that.

447
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,040
I heard that our company

448
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,199
has recently laid off employees.

449
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,439
Since this project fails,

450
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,800
won't we all be laid off?

451
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:39,479
Mu?

452
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,439
Director Xu, you're back now.

453
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,959
Contact Mr. Zhang

454
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,000
from the plan B immediately.

455
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,239
If conditions permit,

456
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,399
please contact the legal department.

457
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:46,959
OK.

458
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,719
Liu,

459
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,479
I want to re-shoot

460
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,439
online paid content.

461
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,800
Put it online within 48 hours.

462
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
Communicate well with the lecturer.

463
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,239
In terms of content,

464
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,040
I want methods, not preaching.

465
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:56,639
OK.

466
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:57,159
Yu,

467
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,919
rewrite the promotion plan

468
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,800
and visual poster.

469
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,560
Just stick the face

470
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,040
of the teacher who is suitable.

471
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:02,760
Jiaojiao,

472
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,840
contact the after-sales services

473
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,320
and ask them to inform the customer,

474
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,360
our content needs to be

475
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,159
fully upgraded this time,

476
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,439
for free! Remember that!

477
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,840
OK.

478
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:10,439
Good.

479
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:10,760
OK.

480
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,159
Director Xu?

481
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,320
Mr. Zhang is

482
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:15,479
looking for you.

483
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:32,679
Mr. Zhang,

484
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:33,679
are you looking for me?

485
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,479
Can you still laugh?

486
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
Of course, I have to question you!

487
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,399
How's your conversation with Ms. Xue?

488
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,159
Oh, not bad.

489
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,919
Did she agree to be a substitute?

490
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,040
Substitute?

491
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:48,959
Rachel said you were

492
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,520
inviting her as a substitute!

493
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:53,399
Yes.

494
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,639
The conversation was good,

495
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,760
but it's not possible,

496
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:57,679
it's expensive.

497
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,600
You get what you pay for,

498
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,159
okay?

499
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,479
Cheapest is the dearest.

500
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,879
Isn't something wrong

501
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,159
with Professor Shang?

502
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,159
Is there a remedial plan?

503
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,280
It has already been arranged.

504
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,360
They are already on it

505
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
and put it online within 48 hours.

506
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,639
Listen,

507
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,840
keep the losses to a minimum!

508
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:15,800
Besides,

509
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,360
can we sue Shang

510
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:18,239
for compensation?

511
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,239
We need to consult to determine

512
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,439
if it is due to force majeure.

513
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,040
You don't need to do this!

514
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,800
I will go. Get out.

515
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,840
Then I'll go out.

516
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,040
Dad! Dad!

517
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,560
Hey, Dad!

518
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,719
Hello, my boy.

519
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,199
How are you doing today?

520
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,040
Are you happy?

521
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,879
He's my dad.

522
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,399
He came to pick me up.

523
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,120
Hello, I'm Xiongxiong's father.

524
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,879
We just moved here.

525
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:55,479
Your help would be appreciated.

526
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,719
My wife is Xu Mengxin.

527
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,639
Our family makes clothing.

528
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:58,399
This is a gift.

529
00:19:58,399 --> 00:19:58,719
Here you are.

530
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,320
Don't mind.

531
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,239

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,879
and worthy of being liked.

709
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,879
But

710
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,560
it's others' business

711
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,439
whether they like me

712
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,280
or pursue me.

713
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,520
I know in my heart

714
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,239
whether I like him or not,

715
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,399
and I won't force myself.

716
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,000
Look, in your case,

717
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,239
when others pursue you,

718
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,360
you accept it in your heart,

719
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,959
right?

720
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,159
But I believe

721
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:43,000
you would never

722
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,199
start a puppy love,

723
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:44,639
would you?

724
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,520
You know me the most.

725
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,639
I'm better than your mom, right?

726
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,840
Exactly!

727
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,199
My mom doesn't stay with me at all.

728
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,679
It's all my dad who does housework,

729
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:55,159
sends me to school,

730
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,840
cooks, and cleans.

731
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,239
When my mom comes back,

732
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,000
she thinks that she did everything,

733
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,439
and she works very hard.

734
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:01,959
Yes.

735
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,399
It's so typical of Xu Meng'an,

736
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:03,879
I told you.

737
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,639
Right?

738
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,040
She just

739
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,399
has an inexplicable desire

740
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,000
to control the people

741
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,800
around her.

742
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,399
Yes.

743
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,040
It's like the world

744
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,159
would collapse

745
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,080
without her.

746
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:19,520
Totally!

747
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,239
She's that kind of person.

748
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,399
Sister!

749
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,399
I bought delicious cakes.

750
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,639
They can bless you with a perfect score.

751
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:26,919
Thanks.

752
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,199
Come on.

753
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,000
Yunjie.

754
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,959
Grandpa, Grandma.

755
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,600
OK.

756
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,000
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

757
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,719
Sit down.

758
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:39,199
Take a rest.

759
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:39,840
Try it.

760
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,239
It can bless you with your grades.

761
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,439
Too much sugar.

762
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,080
Shall we go play for a while?

763
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,399
Cool.

764
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:49,840
We go out and play.

765
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,239
OK.

766
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:50,639
Go.

767
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:51,080
Help me open it.

768
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,159
Mom,

769
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,560
as you see,

770
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,879
can the baby

771
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:02,080
gets along well with Xiongxiong

772
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,520
like Xiongxiong

773
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
with Yunjie

774
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,320
after it's born?

775
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,560
Sure.

776
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,159
What are you thinking about?

777
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,959
Why worry about this?

778
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,040
I'm afraid that

779
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,120
what if it frequently

780
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,719
fights with Xiongxiong

781
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,479
after giving birth?

782
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,080
You and your sister

783
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,320
are still arguing at this age.

784
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,439
That's true.

785
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,120
Yours is not sweet.

786
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,520
Well,

787
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,320
try mine.

788
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,399
Just eat.

789
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,120
Try mine.

790
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,840
Your ice cream has filling.

791
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,760
I even bit it.

792
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,199
My dad is biased.

793
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,159
Totally.

794
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,239
Mine has no filling.

795
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,080
Do you feel hot?

796
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,120
Too hot.

797
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,600
Has Haowen not returned?

798
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,199
He's busy.

799
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,120
Don't worry about him.

800
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,919
We'll eat together.

801
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,560
Always so busy.

802
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,040
Every time...

803
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,159
He brought seafood.

804
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,520
It's hard to have a meal together.

805
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,600
This is the first payment

806
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,520
for the substitute lecturer.

807
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,239
The finance department need your signature.

808
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,840
It's really expensive.

809
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,919
He is considered

810
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,600
the most cost-effective candidate.

811
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,639
And the dropout rate

812
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,520
may be very low.

813
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,320
Are you sure it's all good?

814
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,239
I think so.

815
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,719
Why are you hesitating?

816
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,800
Yes,

817
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,919
absolutely no problem.

818
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,320
Thank you.

819
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,800
Hold on.

820
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,679
Rachel told me that

821
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,199
the layoff lists for each department

822
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:46,199
have been submitted.

823
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,959
What about your department?

824
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,320
Mr. Zhang,

825
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,320
in the current situation,

826
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,120
my department is

827
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,639
really not suitable for layoffs.

828
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,919
Then you should have me fired.

829
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,439
Li Lin,

830
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,159
I'm preparing to return to China.

831
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,840
Are you serious?

832
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,760
Yeah.

833
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,639
I've been thinking for long.

834
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,239
Would your husband

835
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,959
also be willing to come back with you?

836
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,320
I used to have to

837
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,040
worry about his feelings,

838
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,360
but now that I'm divorced,

839
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,840
I don't have any worries anymore.

840
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,719
I can do whatever I want.

841
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,239
Just live my life.

842
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,520
Are you divorced?

843
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,439
Is there anything wrong with that?

844
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,120
It's nothing.

845
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,239
Divorce may not be

846
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,879
a bad thing for me.

847
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,080
You know,

848
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,840
foreigners seem very open,

849
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,000
but in fact,

850
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,919
for a Chinese woman like me,

851
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:11,800
my ex-husband especially

852
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,719
minded my

853
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:13,800
being better than him

854
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,959
academically,

855
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,040
so we

856
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:18,639
got divorced.

857
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,919
I see.

858
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,840
I always thought

859
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,239
you were doing well

860
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,399
abroad.

861
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,959
Maybe everyone thinks

862
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,959
I'm quite glamorous

863
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,600
on the surface.

864
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:39,600
But to be honest...

865
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,600
It's actually quite difficult.

866
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,719
But this time when I came back,

867
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
I was quite happy

868
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,080
to see you.

869
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,800
I still feel

870
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,479
so familiar

871
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,639
with you.

872
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,639
I can express myself without restraint.

873
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:23,360
To be honest,

874
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,959
I haven't told anyone about this,

875
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
including my family.

876
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:34,360
Li Lin,

877
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:35,760
you are still the man

878
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,719
I trust the most.

879
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:54,080
Thanks.

880
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,760
Don't just talk about me.

881
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,919
How are you?

882
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:11,919
I...

883
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,479
Why are you so nervous?

884
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,520
I'm...

885
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,080
I'm not nervous,

886
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,639
not at all.

887
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,199
What am I nervous about?

888
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,199
[I'll do it myself.]

889
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,839
[Hold on.]

890
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:45,679
[It's okay.]

891
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Hands off.

892
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,960
Yu Hai?

893
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,319
It's crooked. You can't see it.

894
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:49,319
Huang just

895
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,440
bought me a shirt,

896
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,239
otherwise I'll be late.

897
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:51,719
Go.

898
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,600
Professor Mei, you're back.

899
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,199
Professor Mei.

900
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,679
Come in.

901
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,239
No, thanks.

902
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,239
You have something to talk about.

903
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:55,440
It's not good.

904
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,359
Afraid I eat you?

905
00:35:58,359 --> 00:35:59,719
They're my students.

906
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,520
I know.

907
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,359
I'm not going in.

908
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,759
What did you

909
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,560
just say to me?

910
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,239
Well...

911
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,600
Professor Mei?

912
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:09,520
I...

913
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,960
What?

914
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,159
Please take it in.

915
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:12,880
Stay in touch.

916
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,639
Goodbye.

917
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,239
Goodbye.

918
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,120
Why aren't you

919
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,560
at home today?

920
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:03,679
Why did you come to

921
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,239
such a place with me?

922
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:07,839
I'm not happy today.

923
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:08,839
What's up?

924
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,839
I submitted a layoff list today

925
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,600
and feel very sad.

926
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,679
It's just the status quo.

927
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,639
The situation of Yu Hai

928
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,799
is also not good.

929
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,520
What we are fighting for now

930
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,120
is not adaptability,

931
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,040
but competitiveness.

932
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,880
I know that.

933
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,159
While...

934
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,520
You should go home

935
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,839
and discuss this with Li Lin.

936
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,279
Talking to a housewife

937
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:39,120
like me

938
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,440
won't help.

939
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,920
Li Lin is not here.

940
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,440
He went to Beijing.

941
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,400
Why going to Beijing?

942
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,880
To meet his old-time love?

943
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,639
Who?

944
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:49,759
Mei Yiduo.

945
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,440
Is she still there?

946
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,799
Don't say that.

947
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,759
She's doing well.

948
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:55,839
She runs

949
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,639
a laboratory in the US.

950
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,520
Are you concerned about

951
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
his ex-girlfriend?

952
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:02,239
Well,

953
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,960
know yourself as well as the enemy.

954
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:07,239
How can you rest assured that

955
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,159
he meets her?

956
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,400
He's making trouble.

957
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,279
But I don't think he dares

958
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,120
or would do that.

959
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,719
Hard to say.

960
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,600
What do you mean?

961
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,839
Sometimes men can't

962
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,799
withstand the test,

963
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,560
especially in front of women.

964
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,799
I still trust him

965
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:37,639
in this regard.

966
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,040
You hesitated.

967
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:40,880
No,

968
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:42,239
I'm serious.

969
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,799
If Li Lin

970
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,839
had any feelings for her...

971
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,120
Mei Yiduo had been

972
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,000
so proactive back then.

973
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,759
If so, then he won't be with me anymore.

974
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,279
How do you know

975
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,719
what they are thinking now?

976
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,120
How are you doing?

977
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,480
Still acting as a decoration at home?

978
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,600
As always.

979
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,600
Has Huang Sisi been bothering you?

980
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,359
She just messaged me.

981
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:17,920
That's really too much!

982
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,319
Sometimes men can't

983
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,400
withstand the test,

984
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,799
especially in front of women.

985
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,880
That's why

986
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,080
I want you to

987
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,719
help me find a job,

988
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,319
and see if I can be

989
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,560
a 'flexible decoration'.

990
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,880
I did find one,

991
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,199
but I don't think it's possible.

992
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,759
A clerk in a real estate company.

993
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:41,799
I think it may be

994
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,080
an insignificant position.

995
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,159
No problem,

996
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:45,799
can I?

997
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,920
You can,

998
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,759
but I don't think

999
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,719
it's necessary.

1000
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,279
Why don't you wait a little longer?

1001
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:53,040
Maybe I can find

1002
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,000
a better one.

1003
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,199
No, no, I don't want to wait.

1004
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,000
It has been eight years,

1005
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,199
and I've become disconnected

1006
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,080
with the outside world.

1007
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,040
I think

1008
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,759
it's good to start

1009
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:04,520
from the bottom.

1010
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,000
How is that possible?

1011
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,359
You learned finance

1012
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,279
and used to work in an investment bank.

1013
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,080
You dress delicately every day

1014
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,000
and interact with elites.

1015
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,480
How can you go there now?

1016
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,400
No, no way.

1017
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,279
The gap is too huge.

1018
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:19,400
It's a waste of your talent.

1019
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:20,679
Not at all.

1020
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,359
Just let me try it.

1021
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,359
If I really

1022
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,759
separate from Yu Hai,

1023
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,239
at least I need to know

1024
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,239
if I have the ability

1025
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,679
to raise two children first.

1026
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,759
Seriously?

1027
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:33,920
Sure.

1028
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,040
Fine.

1029
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:37,359
I will contact

1030
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,199
the senior editor.

1031
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,159
Before you go for the interview,

1032
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,319
I will ask our company's

1033
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,279
HR director

1034
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:43,120
for you

1035
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,000
to give you some guidance.

1036
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,080
Good.

1037
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,199
Come on,

1038
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:50,600
I wish you success.

1039
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,960
Definitely.

1040
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,040
What do you think Li Lin is doing now?

1041
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,960
Just as

1042
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,239
what you're think of.

1043
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,759
Put on slippers.

1044
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,799
No.

1045
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,600
Go.

1046
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:34,040
There's no one at home.

1047
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,159
Why are the lights still on?

1048
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:37,880
I'm here.

1049
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:39,880
Sweetheart.

1050
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,000
Wanzhen?

1051
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,639
I didn't lie to you.

1052
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,799
Didn't you go to Beijing?

1053
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,440
Yeah, I came back at once.

1054
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:58,839
This meeting is a bit hasty.

1055
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,920
Yu Hai always has meetings

1056
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,560
that last for two days

1057
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:03,759
at least.

1058
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:06,839
I'm not his compare.

1059
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,839
Mr. Yu has a great cause.

1060
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:12,040
Alright, you can rest assured now.

1061
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,120
I'm leaving.

1062
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,000
I'll take you back.

1063
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:15,799
No need,

1064
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:17,080
take good care of Meng'an.

1065
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:19,799
Let me know when you get home.

1066
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,719
OK.
