Just in Time EP22

3
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,279
These are all public data.

4
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,200
Only someone well-versed

5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
in the finance industry

6
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,599
could find this answer.

7
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,920
And she consolidated,

8
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,520
analyzed, and made judgments

9
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,039
based on the data.

10
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,839
What do we know about this salesperson?

11
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,640
Not much.

12
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,159
She used to be

13
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,680
a general assistant at the company,

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,599
and before that, she was a housewife.

15
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,839
She hasn't been working for long.

16
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,599
Not really.

17
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,680
This professional report,

18
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,879
however,

19
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,839
seems to be the work of an expert.

20
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,439
So,

21
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,240
could someone be using her

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,120
to target us?

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,200
What does she want?

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,599
She wants to resign

25
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,879
and take all her commissions.

26
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,240
Pay her and let her leave

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,559
with a signed confidentiality agreement.

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,839
So, she was telling the truth?

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,879
Sometimes,

30
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,200
confidence in the financial market

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,039
can be shattered

32
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:04,920
by even

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,120
a small report,

34
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,640
even if it's a distorted one.

35
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,360
So,

36
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,360
the payout won't really be an issue?

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,800
The company's senior-level payments

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,559
are secure.

39
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,279
You have to make sure

40
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:16,999
I get the money you promised.

41
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,120
Don't worry,

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,839
the company is solid.

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
Just handle this matter properly.

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:23,999
Let's go.

45
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,559
Go.

46
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,240
Wanzhen.

47
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,719
Mr. Qian,

48
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,520
these are my personal belongings.

49
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,520
Please check them.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,080
Wanzhen,

51
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,640
let's talk.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,039
About what?

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
The report

54
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,319
or my commissions?

55
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,719
Both.

56
00:03:59,279 --> 00:03:59,839
Here,

57
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,719
sign this agreement.

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
With all the commissions,

59
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,920
I'll add another 20%.

60
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:21,879
Once you walk out that door,

61
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,640
we won't know each other anymore.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,840
Looks like my report

63
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,920
was quite effective.

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,240
The return on investment

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
is better than financial products.

67
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,360
What would happen

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,519
if the clients

69
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,840
found out the truth?

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,040
Wanzhen,

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
don't think

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,280
your amateurish report

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
and concocted data

74
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,680
can have any real impact

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
on the company.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,360
There are plenty of rumors

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,199
in the financial market,

78
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,240
but none

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,519
have caused much of a stir.

80
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,959
Yes,

81
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,759
like an ant trying to shake a tree,

82
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm overestimating myself.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,399
Here's the amount,

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
plus all your commissions.

85
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:04,920
Is that enough?

86
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,999
Mr. Qian, I need to think it over.

87
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
I'll get back to you tomorrow.

88
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,040
Ms. Zhang,

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,840
did you review

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,920
the confidentiality agreement I sent you?

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,120
I did,

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,120
but

93
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
if you sign it,

94
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,720
it could

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,639
give them grounds

96
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,480
for accusing you of extortion.

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,399
If you change it

98
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,559
to a contract

99
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,439
for investigative services

100
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,439
or financial information provision,

101
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,840
it won't be a problem.

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,999
And you could get

103
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,160
a large sum.

104
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,439
I can draft

105
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,360
such a contract for you,

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
and you can negotiate with them.

107
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,559
Is there a way

108
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,959
I can just get

109
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,959
my due commission

110
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,439
without signing anything?

111
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,920
Are you thinking

112
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,680
of making this financial report

113
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,600
public?

114
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,720
I haven't decided yet.

115
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,999
I just want

116
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,720
to get what I'm owed.

117
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,120
Alright.

118
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,559
But Wanzhen,

119
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,680
I still suggest you consider

120
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,319
accepting their settlement terms

121
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,040
and confidentiality clauses.

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,959
It's not a small amount, after all.

123
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,840
If you get this money,

124
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,360
it will

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,160
make your performance record

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
look good.

127
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,199
And

128
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,199
signing

129
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,240
a financial information supply contract

130
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,879
with such a large company

131
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,840
would

132
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,720
demonstrate

133
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,160
your financial capabilities.

134
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,959
Alright, I understand.

135
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,480
I'll think about it.

136
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,840
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

137
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,959
Okay.

138
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,040
Dr. Yu.

139
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,399
Ms. Chen.

140
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,360
Why are you sleeping in the car?

141
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,240
I just finished

142
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
a ten-hour surgery

143
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,399
and couldn't keep my eyes open

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,759
while driving back, so I took a nap.

145
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,639
That's so dangerous,

146
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,040
driving while you're so tired.

147
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,360
It's fine.

148
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,160
Ms. Chen,

149
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
this is also risky.

150
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,959
What's wrong with this?

151
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,999
Your personal information

152
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:45,759
on the delivery label

153
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,999
is too clear.

154
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,800
You use your real name for deliveries?

155
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,240
It's better to obscure personal details

156
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,360
or use an alias.

157
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,800
Yes, yes,

158
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,360
thanks for the reminder.

159
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,240
Sorry.

160
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,920
No worries.

161
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,280
Dr. Yu,

162
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,480
I want to ask you something.

163
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,280
Go ahead.

164
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,720
If some people

165
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,240
don't know they're seriously ill,

166
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
but you do,

167
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,040
would you tell them?

168
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,319
Yes, I'd have to tell them,

169
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,399
or at least inform their family.

170
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
What if they don't believe?

171
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,519
Like the story of Bian Que and Duke Cai.

172
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,559
If you were Bian Que,

173
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,840
would you stay

174
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:35,120
to cure them or

175
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,559
take the money and leave?

176
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,840
Did Bian Que get any money?

177
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,399
It's just an analogy.

178
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,759
I would still

179
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,999
stay to help them

180
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:47,799
get rid of the disease.

181
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,840
After all, if I did leave,

182
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,240
I might feel guilty

183
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,039
for the rest of my life.

184
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,279
We doctors have all taken an oath

185
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,279
to heal and save lives.

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,039
I just remembered

187
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,279
a story

188
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,440
about us doctors;

189
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,799
not sure if it will help you.

190
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:03,960
Go ahead.

191
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,799
One morning

192
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,919
after a storm,

193
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,480
thousands of fish

194
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,960
were stranded on the beach.

195
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,960
A little boy came by

196
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
and started

197
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,679
throwing them back into the sea

198
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,799
one by one.

199
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,159
But being just a child,

200
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,360
he could only throw one at a time,

201
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,399
and very slowly.

202
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,360
An adult passing by

203
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,279
saw this

204
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,919
and went up to the boy.

205
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,360
He said, "The sun will come out soon,

206
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,519
and by then,

207
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,799
these fish will all dry up.

208
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,639
Why bother?

209
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,720
You can only save a few.

210
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
So what's the point?

211
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,440
Who would care?"

212
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
The little boy,

213
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,279
without looking up,

214
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,919
tossed another fish back into the sea

215
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,320
and said,

216
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,720
"This fish would care!"

217
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,720
"And this one!"

218
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,720
"This one, too!"

219
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,919
"This one would care as well!"

220
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,240
How about this?

221
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,840
No good.

222
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Looks nothing different

223
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,759
from my usual school uniform.

224
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,600
I want a performance costume.

225
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,919
Something like a teen idol would wear.

226
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,440
Got it?

227
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,999
It's great!

228
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,200
Graceful and poised,

229
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,080
clean and neat,

230
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,159
proper and decent.

231
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,960
Dad, stop picking.

232
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,519
Mom said she'd buy it for me.

233
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,519
And your taste...

234
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,879
It's just not there.

235
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,399
Really?

236
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,480
If that so,

237
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,080
could I have married your mom?

238
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,279
You should trust

239
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,720
a straight man's taste.

240
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,480
What taste do you have?

241
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,840
You're just good-looking.

242
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:33,999
Without my mom

243
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,120
buying those clothes for you,

244
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,399
you couldn't even leave for work.

245
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,320
I go to work

246
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,120
because of my strong core,

247
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,639
not the outer packaging.

248
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,320
At my workplace,

249
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,879
everyone who sees me

250
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,999
calls me

251
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,320
"Mr. Li".

252
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,919
Now "Mr." is just a general term,

253
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,440
like calling someone "Sir".

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:56,999
Yunjie,

255
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,240
mark my words:

256
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Your mom has definitely

257
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,440
forgotten about

258
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,039
your performance outfit today.

259
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,279
Impossible.

260
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:03,879
Why impossible?

261
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,639
Absolutely impossible.

262
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,799
Why?

263
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,720
Just impossible!

264
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
It's definitely going to happen.

265
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,360
She's so busy,

266
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,639
will she remember this?

267
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,679
She will, for sure.

268
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,120
Wanna bet?

269
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,759
Bet!

270
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,600
Bet on what?

271
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,519
Bet on what?

272
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,440
It's up to you.

273
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,360
Treat me to fried chicken.

274
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,039
Are you crazy?

275
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,999
You dare do it with your aunt around?

276
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,720
We can sneak to the shop and eat.

277
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,240
Alright,

278
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,840
it's a deal.

279
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,159
You won't win anyway.

280
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,279
We'll see.

281
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,919
I'm back!

282
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,919
You're back!

283
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,720
I have to hurry and draw.

284
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,560
Have you eaten?

285
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,639
Yeah, I have.

286
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:43,679
Here, let me help.

287
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,200
Alright.

288
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,279
Take it slow.

289
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:46,879
You're back.

290
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:48,799
Well,

291
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
your dad's home now?

292
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:50,999
Yeah.

293
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,240
Home is nicer than the hospital.

294
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
And Lanxiang is looking after him.

295
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,519
I'm relieved.

296
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,600
Yes, yes.

297
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
How about your sister's wound?

298
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,039
It's almost healed.

299
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,600
In a couple of days,

300
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,799
she'll move to the postnatal care center.

301
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,840
Don't worry.

302
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,600
Alright, have a seat over there.

303
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,519
Fruit will be here soon.

304
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:07,879
Okay.

305
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:08,879
Thank you, Sis.

306
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,519
Mom,

307
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,840
did you buy the performance outfit

308
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,440
I sent in the group?

309
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,639
I...

310
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,879
I'll buy it soon.

311
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,639
Teen idol style.

312
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,799
What?

313
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,840
Have you

314
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
finished your papers?

315
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,039
Bring them over for me to sign.

316
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,159
It's not me asking for it;

317
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,840
your teacher mentioned it

318
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,759
in the group chat.

319
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,360
Just a bit left.

320
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,399
Finish it quickly.

321
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,440
Why bother?

322
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,440
Coming back

323
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,399
to press her with homework.

324
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,279
No need for that.

325
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,360
Am I pressing?

326
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm encouraging, okay?

327
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,919
Ask any kid who got into Tsinghua

328
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,720
or Peking University,

329
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,120
weren't they all encouraged like this?

330
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,999
Right, Sis?

331
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,159
Yes, exactly.

332
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,799
If I hadn't pushed you,

333
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,519
would you have made it to grad school?

334
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,720
See?

335
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,240
Come.

336
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,039
Come.

337
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Have some grapes.

338
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,799
People say

339
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,919
eating grapes

340
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,440
makes children fair-skinned.

341
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,519
Our second baby

342
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,600
is called Little Grape.

343
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,360
Little Grape?

344
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
Named by Yunjie.

345
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,399
What a coincidence!

346
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,039
Little Grape, Little Watermelon.

347
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,999
Nice, nice.

348
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,399
I love this name.

349
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,560
So sweet.

350
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,919
Finished so quickly?

351
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,240
An invitation?

352
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,320
Inviting whom?

353
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,399
Inviting you!

354
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,600
How about it, Ms. Xu Meng'an?

355
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,039
I sincerely invite

356
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,440
You and Baby Little Grape

357
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,039
to attend my performance.

358
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,799
To experience a spiritual cleansing,

359
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,159
and also to give Little Grape

360
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,440
a prenatal music lesson.

361
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,560
You even know about prenatal education?

362
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Of course!

363
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:57,919
You told me before,

364
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,799
when I was in your belly,

365
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,039
I even listened to classical music.

366
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,159
You said listening to classical music

367
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,399
would make me smart.

368
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,279
I didn't say that,

369
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,399
science says so.

370
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,360
So leave Little Grape's prenatal education

371
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
to me!

372
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,759
Hey, Yunjie,

373
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:12,480
what about me?

374
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,080
Why isn't my name on it?

375
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,960
We're so close,

376
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,840
we don't need formalities.

377
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,720
Doesn't matter,

378
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,639
I'll go whether I'm invited or not.

379
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,840
Your dad is feeling awkward,

380
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,039
Favoring me over him.

381
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,999
Not encouraged!

382
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,560
I... I'll go comfort him.

383
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,080
You two guys,

384
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,480
over a meal of fried chicken,

385
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,639
is it really worth it?

386
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,240
Feeling jealous?

387
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Do you feel like

388
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,639
after raising her so painstakingly,

389
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,519
I ended up picking the fruit?

390
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,360
It's okay, dear.

391
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,519
She'll surely take care of you in old age.

392
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,919
Of course, that goes without saying.

393
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,360
She just sees that you're

394
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,200
pregnant,

395
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,320
and have been quite tired lately.

396
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,879
So she wrote this to cheer you up.

397
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,919
Why would I be jealous?

398
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,480
If that so,

399
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,799
I'd be quite pleased.

400
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,399
But don't deny

401
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,799
that you're feeling a bit jealous.

402
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,720
To be honest,

403
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,320
are you feeling

404
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,440
a little sour inside?

405
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,840
Just a little,

406
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,159
a tiny bit.

407
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,960
I knew it!

408
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,039
It says here,

409
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,480
4:30 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.

410
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:18,639
Yeah.

411
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,120
I thought it was in the morning,

412
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,039
like when she used to practice the piano.

413
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,919
What's wrong?

414
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,600
They notified me today

415
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,960
That I need to attend

416
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,560
an awards ceremony on Sunday afternoon.

417
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,159
They said I've been nominated.

418
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,360
Doesn't that clash with the recital?

419
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,519
What should we do?

420
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:47,720
Alright.

421
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,320
I'll head out right away.

422
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,320
Little fairy!

423
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:53,879
Sis,

424
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,159
look at our Yunjie,

425
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,919
doesn't she look graceful?

426
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,039
Come, turn around.

427
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,440
Beautiful.

428
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:02,799
Stop!

429
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,759
Two issues here.

430
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,159
First, it's a bit plain.

431
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,960
Second,

432
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,759
wouldn't it be better

433
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,120
to wear a vest over it?

434
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,239
Aunt, are you serious?

435
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,239
It's a bit revealing, dear.

436
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,919
I think your aunt's suggestion

437
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,040
is worth considering.

438
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,439
How do you think I look in this outfit?

439
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,479
It looks great!

440
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,479
I think our girl

441
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,239
can dress up a bit more.

442
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,840
Yes, exactly!

443
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:38,959
Li Lin,

444
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,040
why are you dressed so sharp?

445
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,280
I have to go too.

446
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,280
Sis,

447
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,719
you mean well and always speak the truth,

448
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,959
but speaking the truth

449
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,800
should depend on the occasion, right?

450
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,959
I do know the occasion!

451
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
Aren't we at home now?

452
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,840
So, I have to speak the truth.

453
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,719
Do you want me to lie instead?

454
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,239
Sometimes a little white lie

455
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
is acceptable,

456
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,600
to lighten the mood!

457
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,360
I can't win an argument with you.

458
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,399
Mom, you have so many

459
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
girlish accessories!

460
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
I've never seen you wear them!

461
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,120
Why does this one

462
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
still have the tag on it?

463
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
It's new, of course.

464
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,520
I like this kind of

465
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,600
bling-bling stuff too.

466
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,800
But there's just

467
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,399
no chance to wear them.

468
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,919
Then why did you buy them?

469
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,879
Such a waste of money.

470
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,959
You always lecture me!

471
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,080
Just bought them first.

472
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,520
They're all for you.

473
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,679
Then why don't you give them to me?

474
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,959
Apart from a few hair ties,

475
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,959
what else have you given me?

476
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,360
Any other good stuff?

477
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,159
Hand them over!

478
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,159
I'm saving them all for you.

479
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,040
For when you go to college.

480
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,080
I knew you'd say that!

481
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,520
By the time I'm in college,

482
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,879
these will all be outdated.

483
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,120
No way!

484
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:53,199
This necklace looks nice.

485
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,000
Try it on.

486
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,800
How is it?

487
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,560
Looks good!

488
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,639
Nice.

489
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,560
But it's missing something.

490
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,479
Here, this one.

491
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,919
Looks great. See for yourself!

492
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,120
Don't you look like a little princess?

493
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,399
So pretty!

494
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:22,760
Looks nice, right?

495
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,959
Alright, let's go.

496
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,000
My little princess!

497
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,360
Meng'an,

498
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:29,399
I got a scarf.

499
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,639
Put it on her.

500
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,239
Look, the color is perfect!

501
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
Alright.

502
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,600
Otherwise, it's too plain.

503
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,800
See, how bright it is!

504
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,159
Right!

505
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,919
Little girls should wear bright colors.

506
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,439
Exactly.

507
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,439
Mom, are you dressing me for winter?

508
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,239
Thank your Aunt.

509
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,360
Thank you, Aunt.

510
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,000
The back...

511
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,239
It's covered.

512
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,600
Now, with all this air conditioning,

513
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,439
you must keep your chest and back warm.

514
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,239
Got it?

515
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:59,719
You're right.

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
We're out of time; we need to go.

517
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,560
Alright, you go ahead.

518
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,280
Bye, Aunt.

519
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,639
Okay, bye-bye.

520
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,840
None of you are easy.

521
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,479
I really can't stand this.

522
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,320
And you're still siding with Aunt!

523
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,280
From a health perspective,

524
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,439
your aunt is right.

525
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,320
Aesthetically, maybe not so much.

526
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:22,600
Just go along with her a bit.

527
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,560
What's the harm?

528
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:25,639
Mom,

529
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,239
you really are two-faced.

530
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,080
First place!

531
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,280
Ladies,

532
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:31,879
the car has been checked.

533
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,919
You may get in.

534
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,639
Please.

535
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,120
Dad, you look so handsome today!

536
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,600
Now even drivers

537
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,719
are as handsome as you?

538
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,000
Industry competition, you know.

539
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:43,679
No PDA in front of me!

540
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,320
We're married, okay?

541
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:48,840
Let's go.

542
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,159
Watch carefully.

543
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,239
He is going to open the car door for me.

544
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,159
Here we go!

545
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,520
Driving feels great today.

546
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,239
Like I'm riding the waves!

547
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,959
Keep it steady, please!

548
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:30,239
Mom,

549
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:31,439
you're amazing!

550
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,520
Top 10 in the city!

551
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
Maybe you'll even win first place today.

552
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,639
No, I'm just a nominee.

553
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:38,520
Let's not exaggerate,

554
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,000
okay?

555
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,560
Out of ten winners,

556
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,719
you're definitely one of them!

557
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm so proud!

558
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,320
Last night, I was even upset

559
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,120
because you couldn't come with me

560
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,320
to my performance.

561
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,560
I take back what I said.

562
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,479
Bring back a big trophy!

563
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,120
I feel like I've already won!

564
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,760
Won my daughter's approval.

565
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,360
My mom is awesome.

566
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,120
If I could make it to the city's top 10,

567
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:04,800
no,

568
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,959
even the top 100...

569
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,639
Your mom would smile in her sleep!

570
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:11,239
Your dad would faint from happiness.

571
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,760
I was just saying.

572
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,760
Don't pressure me.

573
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,639
Yunjie,

574
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:17,560
if you have an idea,

575
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,639
you have to act on it.

576
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,760
The reason your mom

577
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,719
has her achievements today

578
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:22,399
is entirely because of her

579
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:23,360
strong execution.

580
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,560
How about letting me

581
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,520
take over your studies?

582
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,840
No need!

583
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,159
Look at you two!

584
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:40,199
Hello, Ms. Zhang, good morning.

585
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,560
Wanzhen,

586
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,919
I've sent you the electronic draft

587
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,320
of the supply contract.

588
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,800
I've made a few more revisions.

589
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,600
There should be no

590
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,360
legal loopholes now.

591
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,719
You can now secure legal financial rights

592
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,639
for you and your child.

593
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,159
I'm truly happy for you.

594
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,919
Ms. Zhang,

595
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,239
I've thought about it all night.

596
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,280
I've decided

597
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,239
to give up the money.

598
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,520
Why?

599
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,840
That's your hard-earned money!

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,719
At least

601
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,239
get your performance bonus back.

602
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,800
Then, could you help me check

603
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,520
If I make this report

604
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,879
publicly available,

605
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,000
what kind of legal responsibility

606
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,560
will I face?

607
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,320
There won't be any legal risks.

608
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,120
These data

609
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,600
were obtained through public sources,

610
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,360
and you're simply exercising

611
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,919
your right to commercial oversight.

612
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,479
Of course, they might

613
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,679
decide to sue you,

614
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,239
but if it comes to that,

615
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,719
I'm confident we can win.

616
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,719
Hearing you say that

617
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,479
puts me at ease.

618
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,679
But why

619
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:33,719
don't you want the money?

620
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,800
You're divorced,

621
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,159
and you could use the money.

622
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,439
I think

623
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,800
there are more important things to do.

624
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,600
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

625
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Alright.

626
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:45,800
Goodbye.

627
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,040
That's great.

628
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,239
I should work hard too.

629
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,159
Next time, have Rachel

630
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:39,919
sign me up as well.

631
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,520
Okay.

632
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,520
Go for it.

633
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:41,959
Sure.

634
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,239
Grab something to eat. Want to join?

635
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,760
No, thanks. You go ahead.

636
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,560
Thanks.

637
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:48,919
Miss Huang always has interesting ideas.

638
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,040
Indeed she does.

639
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,600
I just follow the boss's lead.

640
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,520
Excuse me.

641
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:53,639
Alright, alright.

642
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,959
You finally showed up.

643
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,600
They've been driving me crazy.

644
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,959
Still hanging out with Huang Sisi?

645
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:11,760
And you still want to remarry?

646
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,080
You're quite conflicted.

647
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,080
I'm totally conflicted right now.

648
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,239
I have no choice.

649
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,600
Right now, I'm

650
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,159
being held hostage by the investors.

651
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,280
You know,

652
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,520
she's an executive in our company,

653
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,439
right?

654
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:27,959
The investors won't let her leave,

655
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,520
so I can't force her out.

656
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,159
Right?

657
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:30,879
Right now,

658
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,120
my company is at a critical point.

659
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,760
I can't afford to cause any disputes.

660
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,239
But I've heard that Huang Sisi

661
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,399
has contacted a headhunting company

662
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,159
and has been frequently in touch

663
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,360
with various company bosses.

664
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,800
She knows very well

665
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,600
in her heart

666
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,919
that once her contract

667
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,080
with Blue Ocean expires,

668
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,120
I won't renew it.

669
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:52,159
By then,

670
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:52,959
we'll part on good terms.

671
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,600
And no one will bother the other.

672
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,360
But you need to give me some time.

673
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:56,760
Right?

674
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,360
We're almost at that point.

675
00:25:58,919 --> 00:25:59,919
It's not easy for me either.

676
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,800
She finally managed

677
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,159
get Wanzhen out of the picture.

678
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,520
Can she really leave you amicably?

679
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,159
I find that hard to believe.

680
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,760
So, I'm really in a tough spot.

681
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,639
Think about it,

682
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,399
if I were involved with her,

683
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,320
would she let me off easily?

684
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:14,399
Wouldn't she

685
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:15,560
make my life hell?

686
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,159
I really

687
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,439
have nothing to do with her.

688
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,560
How about this...

689
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,719
Let Wanzhen

690
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:22,840
see my actions.

691
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,040
Since the divorce, Wanzhen

692
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,520
has been living quite well.

693
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,239
She looks even prettier now.

694
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,719
What's there to see in your actions?

695
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,320
Stop acting.

696
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,320
It's impossible.

697
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,399
She's just toughing it out.

698
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,280
A woman,

699
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,800
raising two kids while working.

700
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,120
Don't worry.

701
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,840
I won't be like someone,

702
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,719
abandoning my wife and kids.

703
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,320
I won't give up.

704
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:45,639
No, wait,

705
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,239
Who gave up on whom back then?

706
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,959
Don't make me sound so terrible.

707
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,320
Okay?

708
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,719
Can't you wish me something good?

709
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,120
I'm just making you face reality.

710
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Once my company's

711
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,399
funding issue is resolved,

712
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,840
I'll be free

713
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,879
to win Wanzhen

714
00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:03,600
back.

715
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,800
I'll throw a grand wedding,

716
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,919
with the best cars,

717
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,479
and the scenic route,

718
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:10,679
hotel,

719
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,360
food, drinks, cigars,

720
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,120
right?

721
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,360
I'll upgrade everything.

722
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,000
Even the guests will be upgraded.

723
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,879
Not like years ago, right?

724
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,439
Then tell me,

725
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,840
should my gift money

726
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,000
also be upgraded?

727
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,560
I never thought,

728
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
I,

729
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,320
in this lifetime,

730
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,840
would get to have a second wedding.

731
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:33,280
Of course, it's with my Wanzhen.

732
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,239
You better come then.

733
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,919
And upgrade your gift too.

734
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:38,719
Shameless!

735
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:38,800
Make sure to buy a lot.

736
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,520
Make sure to buy a lot.

737
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,800
Listen to Mengyi talk to you.

738
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,479
It's really good.

739
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,560
I bought a lot myself.

740
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,360
The profit is quite high.

741
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,280
Let me explain it well.

742
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,639
Alright.

743
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,239
But this time,

744
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:46,840
uncles and aunties,

745
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,679
make sure to listen to

746
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,239
Rui this time.

747
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,199
It's really good.

748
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,040
Make sure to buy, okay?

749
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,159
Let me show you.

750
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:51,959
I'll think about it.

751
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:00,719
How about it?

752
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,560
Anything you don't understand?

753
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:03,879
If you don't understand, you can ask

754
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:04,959
our sales staff.

755
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,280
Uncles, aunts,

756
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:07,879
the investment

757
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:08,719
comes with risks.

758
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,399
You must be cautious when buying.

759
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,360
The debt ratio of Huaxing Company

760
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,800
has exceeded the warning line.

761
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,080
You all worked hard to earn this money.

762
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,320
Don't let it go to waste.

763
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,120
Take a look.

764
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,479
This is probably the only chance.

765
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,000
What's being sent?

766
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,320
So,

767
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:22,959
make sure to seize this opportunity.

768
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,760
Don't listen to her.

769
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
She's a salesperson for this company.

770
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,000
Look,

771
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,560
she's competing with our salesperson

772
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,399
for business.

773
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,199
She wants to take the share

774
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,639
we have earned.

775
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,439
Everyone, just ignore her.

776
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,199
Feifei, Feifei.

777
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,280
Uncle Liu, don't get angry!

778
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,639
Feifei,

779
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,679
that woman competing with you for business

780
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,239
is here again.

781
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,760
Don't be angry, calm down.

782
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,120
Wanzhen,

783
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,320
what do you want?

784
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,560
Wanzhen,

785
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,239
we're all from the same company.

786
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,479
If you don't sell investment products,

787
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,679
don't ruin our livelihoods.

788
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,360
Exactly.

789
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,159
I have already resigned.

790
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,840
I'm no longer with the company.

791
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,040
I'm just fulfilling my duty

792
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,959
as a citizen.

793
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:00,760
You can

794
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,800
sell your investment products,

795
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,120
But I can also remind everyone

796
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,360
that investments come with risks, right?

797
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,199
Take a look.

798
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,639
This is the company's financial report.

799
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,000
The elders might not understand it,

800
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,439
but as salespeople, you should.

801
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,280
If

802
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
the bank tightens loans to the company,

803
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,439
then the investment products

804
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,000
will face difficulty in repayment.

805
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,159
Take a look at this.

806
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:20,840
Feifei,

807
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,959
there seems to be a problem.

808
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,080
I'll go ask Mr. Qian.

809
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:29,600
Uncle, please take a look.

810
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,159
Hello?

811
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,199
I'm going to find Chen Wanzhen now

812
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,399
and have her sign the agreement.

813
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,000
The profit and commission you promised me

814
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,040
must be delivered.

815
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,879
Mr. Qian,

816
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,199
look at this.

817
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,399
Is what Wanzhen said true?

818
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,080
Where is she?

819
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,120
Congratulations to all

820
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,639
the outstanding women in the industry

821
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:15,360
for winning

822
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,639
the Top 10 Influential Women

823
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:18,719
in the Chunjiang Internet Industry.

824
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,840
All of you are local

825
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,879
heroines in the Internet industry.

826
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:23,600
Let's give them another round of applause.

827
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,719
Now, let's invite our

828
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,120
outstanding women to take their seats.

829
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:34,840
Come.

830
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,399
Wonderful.

831
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,399
Take it.

832
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:39,800
Host,

833
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,439
I have something to say.

834
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,360
This outstanding woman

835
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,280
has some words to share

836
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,360
upon receiving the award.

837
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,840
Please, go ahead.

838
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,479
Thanks.

839
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,040
Dear colleagues,

840
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,159
good afternoon.

841
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,879
I'm Huang Sisi,

842
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:53,800
the Content Director

843
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,879
of Blue Ocean Media.

844
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,800
I am especially grateful to everyone

845
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,879
for your recognition.

846
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,399
Although

847
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,360
this is a personal award,

848
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,159
it represents the collective wisdom

849
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,959
of everyone at Blue Ocean Media.

850
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,560
Standing here,

851
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,439
the person I most want to thank

852
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,760
is also present today,

853
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,879
my mentor,

854
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,080
Mr. Yu Hai,

855
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,679
the President of Blue Ocean Media.

856
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,800
Mr. Yu,

857
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
without you,

858
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,439
there wouldn't be

859
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:32,080
me standing here today.

860
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:34,159
I want to dedicate this award

861
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:35,360
to you.

862
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,879
Well said!

863
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,120
Miss Huang

864
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,600
is truly grateful

865
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,479
and knows how to repay kindness,

866
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,399
a role model for modern women.

867
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,800
Cringeworthy.

868
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,000
Wanzhen,

869
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,879
are you here

870
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:09,760
to ruin my moment on purpose?

871
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,000
Didn't you agree

872
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
to sign the agreement with us?

873
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,399
Why are you still spreading

874
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,439
this false information?

875
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,479
Mr. Qian,

876
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
are you referring

877
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:21,280
to this confidentiality agreement?

878
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,879
Is this the one?

879
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,520
Mr. Qian, I'm sorry.

880
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,760
I've decided

881
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,000
to give up both the money

882
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,360
and the commissions.

883
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,600
Feifei,

884
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,639
stop urging people

885
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:40,439
to buy the investment products.

886
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,520
Quickly redeem

887
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,639
what you've bought yourselves.

888
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,120
Otherwise, once the financial market

889
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,840
reveals the company's

890
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,639
financial statements,

891
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:47,760
the investment products

892
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,919
will also face

893
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:49,879
repayment issues.

894
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,280
Ask Mr. Qian

895
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,479
if his money has been redeemed.

896
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,399
Stop talking nonsense here.

897
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm sticking with the company!

898
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,080
Mr. Qian, you're a smart man.

899
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,479
After seeing that report,

900
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:02,600
you should know what's going on, right?

901
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,919
When the company is about to collapse,

902
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,560
the first to exit

903
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,560
are those in the know

904
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,040
before the investment products default.

905
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,679
And those left holding the bag

906
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,239
are these innocent people.

907
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:11,919
Feifei,

908
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:12,600
Mr. Wu,

909
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:13,919
you know how much you have bought,

910
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,719
don't you?

911
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,879
Wanzhen,

912
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:17,239
what should we do now?

913
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,199
We demand immediate redemption.

914
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,120
Yes, yes.

915
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,639
We won't be the scapegoats.

916
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,360
Thank you to Zhouzhou

917
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,080
for the wonderful performance.

918
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,479
Next, let's welcome

919
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,400
Wang Yunxi

920
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,359
to perform

921
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,279
Etude in B minor.

922
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,040
Excuse me.

923
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,960
Sorry.

924
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,440
Dad,

925
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:28,080
I changed my number six to NO. 8.

926
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,359
Mom should be able to make it, right?

927
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,120
You changed it?

928
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,719
You're something!

929
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,839
Alright.

930
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,920
Mom went on stage to get an award!

931
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,679
Mom looks beautiful!

932
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,560
So elegant!

933
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:44,759
What number is it now?

934
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,279
No. 6 now.

935
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,279
It's currently NO. 6.

936
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,440
You're NO. 8.

937
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,799
Isn't it almost your turn?

938
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:50,440
Yes.

939
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,960
No,

940
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,880
I have to call your mom

941
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,279
and tell her to come quickly.

942
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:57,080
Go on, sit down properly.

943
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,839
Sit down, sit down.

944
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,679
Hello, honey,

945
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,759
I'm done here.

946
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,040
I'll be there right after a quick stop.

947
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:06,960
Alright.

948
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:07,719
Tell the driver

949
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,799
to speed up

950
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:09,679
safely.

951
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,480
Mom,

952
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:13,520
I just saw the photo of you

953
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,000
receiving the award on stage.

954
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
You're beautiful and powerful,

955
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,199
better than a celebrity.

956
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,400
Thanks, sweetheart.

957
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,440
I'll be there soon.

958
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,400
Alright, I'm waiting for you.

959
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,480
You really know how to lay it on thick.

960
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,520
I'm just telling the truth.

961
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,799
Why are you out again?

962
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:28,520
Go back inside.

963
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,279
Hurry up.

964
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,480
Did I say something wrong?

965
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,679
You really are my mentor.

966
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,239
And you did discover me.

967
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:39,359
Wait, are you out of your mind?

968
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,799
Performing for an audience?

969
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,000
Who are you trying to impress?

970
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,000
How am I acting?

971
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,920
Every word I said is true.

972
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,239
Even if you kick me out,

973
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,000
I'll still be grateful you discovered me.

974
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,400
Can we stop this act, please?

975
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,480
Once the contract ends,

976
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,679
you can just leave.

977
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,639
You go your way,

978
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,759
I'll go mine.

979
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:55,600
We're not connected.

980
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,239
Aren't you embarrassed?

981
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,679
As long as I'm not embarrassed,

982
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,040
the awkwardness is on others.

983
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,839
Fine.

984
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,359
You win.

985
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,359
What's wrong?

986
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,560
Not feeling well?

987
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,440
It's nothing.

988
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,799
Just feeling a bit nauseous.

989
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,199
I'm leaving now.

990
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,880
Quite attentive, aren't you?

991
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,159
Still waiting here.

992
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,159
Yeah, yeah, waiting for what?

993
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,040
Your prized find.

994
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,600
Why wait for her? I'm waiting for you.

995
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,159
I'm not your mentor.

996
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:18,960
Why wait for me?

997
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,600
No, it's just...

998
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,279
Where are you headed?

999
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,719
I'll drive you.

1000
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,239
No need.

1001
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,400
I'm going to find my daughter.

1002
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,000
Come on, just get in my car.

1003
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,000
Let's talk.

1004
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't want to talk.

1005
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:28,880
I have some intel.

1006
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,600
Interested?

1007
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:35,040
You're no fun.

1008
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,120
We've been friends

1009
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,239
for over 20 years,

1010
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,560
and now

1011
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,359
I need to use intel

1012
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,359
to chat?

1013
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,000
Are you coming or not?

1014
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,560
Alright, alright, let's go.

1015
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,239
Get in my car.

1016
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,000
What's that smell in your car?

1017
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,960
No smell at all.

1018
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,880
Is it the car freshener?

1019
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,000
Hey,

1020
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,839
who bought this air freshener?

1021
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,880
Miss Huang gave it to us.

1022
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:24,679
Stop the car.

1023
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,639
It's nauseating.

1024
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:26,639
I want to get out.

1025
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,319
No, no, no.

1026
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:28,359
What are you doing?

1027
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,560
Lv.

1028
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,679
Yes, Mr. Yu?

1029
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,639
Well,

1030
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,639
is that a trash can up ahead?

1031
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,759
Quick, throw that air freshener away.

1032
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,040
Got it, Mr. Yu.

1033
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,880
I had no idea who bought it.

1034
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,560
It's disgusting.

1035
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:54,480
Makes me want to vomit.

1036
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:56,960
Such a big reaction.

1037
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,600
Are you pregnant?

1038
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,679
Really pregnant?

1039
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,799
Unbelievable.

1040
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,359
Wait, my Senior Li Lin

1041
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,319
is really something.

1042
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,359
Making you earn money outside,

1043
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,799
and now having you bear a baby?

1044
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:19,839
Wanzhen

1045
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,279
hasn't earning for you.

1046
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:22,080
Where is he now?

1047
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,520
Hitting the sore spot, huh?

1048
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,400
Can you chat properly?

1049
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,159
Nope.

1050
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:30,560
Wait,

1051
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,880
your career is quite stable now,

1052
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,279
on the rise.

1053
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:35,679
Your position is solid.

1054
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
Why have a baby now?

1055
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:39,560
I'm having it because I'm pregnant.

1056
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,000
I talked to Mr. Zhang about it.

1057
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,400
Anyway, now it's no longer

1058
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,239
a secret.

1059
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,679
So,

1060
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,080
this matter is all out in the open.

1061
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,880
I'm telling you,

1062
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,000
I was just about to bring this up.

1063
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Mr. Zhang is now scouting for people.

1064
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,239
Is he trying to replace you?

1065
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,080
Gotten wind of it.

1066
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:01,440
Lv,

1067
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,560
put on your headphones.

1068
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,080
Poor thing.

1069
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,040
Even the driver isn't yours?

1070
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,120
Better safe than sorry.

1071
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,000
Mr. Zhang is recruiting,

1072
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,880
and he's reached Huang Sisi.

1073
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:22,440
Is that supposed to be intel?

1074
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,319
I knew that long ago.

1075
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,759
But Huang Sisi can't make it.

1076
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,520
The salary and position she wants

1077
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,400
are things Mr. Zhang can't offer.

1078
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:32,880
That was the first negotiation.

1079
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:34,960
If Huang Sisi

1080
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,120
knew you were pregnant,

1081
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,799
she'd know that

1082
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,839
you'd have a vacancy

1083
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,400
in your position.

1084
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,040
When you're not in the company,

1085
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,600
right?

1086
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,319
If they negotiate again,

1087
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,600
and each makes a compromise,

1088
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,759
your position could

1089
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:47,679
be in jeopardy.

1090
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,719
Thank you.

1091
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,239
Let me tell you,

1092
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,279
Huang Sisi,

1093
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
I know her very well.

1094
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,759
She's very shrewd

1095
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,400
and loves taking shortcuts.

1096
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,080
Be careful.

1097
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,000
Shortcuts are the longest route.

1098
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,239
I'm not afraid.

1099
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,679
Just be careful yourself.

1100
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,679
Thanks to Youyou

1101
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:12,319
for the wonderful performance.

1102
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,679
Next up, please enjoy

1103
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:15,719
the sonata performed by Qin Xiyi,

1104
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,920
the first movement of G Major Sonata.

1105
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:20,040
I've switched to No. 12.

1106
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:24,880
How much longer do you need?

1107
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,480
I'm stuck in traffic!

1108
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,120
Hurry up, speed it up.

1109
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,080
Your daughter is about to go on stage.

1110
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:34,000
I'll definitely be there.

1111
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
There's traffic on the road.

1112
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,719
Just wait a bit.

1113
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:38,600
It looks like your mom

1114
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,960
is really stuck in traffic.

1115
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,920
Maybe just forget it.

1116
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,639
Don't let her come.

1117
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:42,520
No way!

1118
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:43,520
It was my mom

1119
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,239
who made me learn the piano.

1120
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,480
Today is the last lesson.

1121
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,759
Mom, I hope you can make it.

1122
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:48,799
Yes.

1123
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,040
Sweetie, mom will definitely be there.

1124
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:51,920
Well,

1125
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,880
maybe you could tell the teacher

1126
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,880
to move a few acts behind?

1127
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:57,679
I'm already the last.

1128
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,560
How can that be the last?

1129
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,560
That's called the finale.

1130
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,080
You're so well-prepared,

1131
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,759
you must be the finale.

1132
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,480
Ms. Xu Meng'an,

1133
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,880
if you don't come,

1134
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,600
don't regret it.

1135
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:11,920
Wait.

1136
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,080
Your mom said she'd be here for sure.

1137
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:16,960
Don't worry.
