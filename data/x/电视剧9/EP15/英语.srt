[Just in Time]
[EP15]

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,400
The seedling, it sprouted,

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,240
but

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,839
it's not growing properly.

6
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,320
[Maybe it needs]

7
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,479
[some medicine,]

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,839
[some injections,]

9
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,120
and some rest

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,320
to get back

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,839
on the right track.

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,400
Then, how about now?

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,719
Are the grapevines doing okay?

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,839
Most likely.

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,919
They're growing normally now.

16
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,120
But it's still seven or eight months

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,320
until they bear fruit.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,039
It means that

19
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,400
in another seven or eight months,

20
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm going to have a younger brother.

21
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,839
Why a brother,

22
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:22,759
not a sister?

23
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,999
My cousin said you like sour things,

24
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:25,999
so it should be brother.

25
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,279
That's pseudoscience.

26
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,879
We can't believe in that.

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Having a baby

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,200
is like opening a blind box.

29
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,279
You only know the gender

30
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,759
after it's born.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,279
What about me?

32
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,800
The blind box of me,

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
are you satisfied with it?

34
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:44,800
Of course,

35
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,360
our Yunjie

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,080
is the best.

37
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,400
You know what,

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,039
when you were just born,

39
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,800
your dad held you,

40
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,200
I could tell he was really happy,

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,039
and excited.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
[And then,]

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,879
[he just kept grinning.]

44
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,279
[But he couldn't help crying]

45
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,920
[all the time.]

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,879
I was so shocked.

47
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,839
You know?

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,680
Really? My dad cried?

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
Really!

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,999
[He bawled his eyes out.]

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,759
[It's rare to see him like that.]

52
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,439
[That's true.]

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,800
Then after "little grape" is born,

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
I'll get to see my dad cry.

55
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,879
The point you focus

56
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,480
is too different with others'.

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,400
Little grape?

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,680
Who's that?

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,159
That's how you name it?

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,759
[So, you like to have a brother]

61
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,879
[or a sister?]

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,559
[Sister.]

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,080
So I can hold her,

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
sleep with her,

65
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,400
and braid her hair.

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,319
I can also play with her,

67
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,319
and wear matching clothes

68
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,599
with her.

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,879
No, it won't work,

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,879
she's too little.

71
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,159
You can also watch her do her homework.

72
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:50,759
Right!

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,759
I can also teach her to play the piano.

74
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
[As she grows up,]

75
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,279
[there will be so many things]

76
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,879
[you can do together.]

77
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,999
Your dad's here.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,159
You two ladies,

79
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,879
it's time to head home.

80
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:13,599
Dad,

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,559
take a seat.

82
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,480
Let's chat for a bit.

83
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,520
Continue chatting?

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,599
I heard that when I was born,

85
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:20,960
you were bawling your eyes out.

86
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:21,520
Is it true?

87
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,879
You should sell my privacy

88
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,840
to get emotional support.

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,999
Aren't we family?

90
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,319
So when my sister is born,

91
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,040
can you cry like that again?

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
I've never seen you cry.

93
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:39,720
I can't guarantee that.

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,959
Don't put pressure on me.

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,439
What if I can't cry?

96
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
That would be so embarrassing.

97
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,160
Just take it easy, okay?

98
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,199
Let's wait together

99
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,199
for that day to come.

100
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,999
Wanwan, Zhenzhen.

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Mom's home.

102
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,959
[Mommy.]

00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,800
[Sweetheart.]

104
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,399
[I'm so sorry.]

105
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,079
[Mom had an overtime today,]

106
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,040
[so I come back late.]

107
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:01,999
Dr. Yu.

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,639
You are...?

109
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,160
Hi,

110
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,519
Mr. Yu asked me to come over.

111
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,319
I'm so sorry

112
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,439
for keeping you waiting so late.

113
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,160
Never mind.

114
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,360
Mom's back,

115
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,280
so goodbye, you guys.

116
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,600
Uncle Yu Chen,

117
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,360
tomorrow you should tell me the story

118
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,519
about the Journey to the West.

119
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,439
Don't worry, Uncle will prepare well.

120
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:19,999
Okay.

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,199
Were they well-behaved?

122
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,079
Definitely.

123
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,840
Absolutely.

124
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,999
Absolutely.

125
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,600
[Well, go on.]

126
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,319
[Mr. Yu,]

127
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,199
[that's the situation.]

128
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,920
[Thanks to Dr. Yu.]

129
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,800
[Otherwise,]

130
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,439
[I wouldn't be able to]

131
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,280
[handle those two kids]

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,199
[by myself.]

133
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,959
Mr. Yu, I can't do this job

134
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,079
one more time.

135
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,519
Please spare me.

136
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,759
I just ask you to

137
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,280
look after two little girls.

138
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,759
Is it that difficult?

139
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
You even got an outsider,

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,519
a male one.

141
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,280
It was not me.

142
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,240
It were your daughters

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,519
who wanted to play with him.

144
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,360
[And]

145
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,319
[if without the help of]

146
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,840
[that handsome guy,]

147
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,600
I even couldn't walk in the door.

148
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,959
They're quite familiar with

149
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,240
that uncle doctor.

150
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,199
What do you mean familiar?

151
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,600
Not familiar.

152
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,800
It's just being polite.

153
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,240
That's because our kids are sensible,

154
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,360
and well-raised by their mother.

155
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,480
What familiar?

156
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,639
[Mr. Yu,]

157
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,199
I understand what you're saying.

158
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,920
Don't worry,

159
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,480
I've seen all the process.

160
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
[The living room doors]

161
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,600
[were all wide open.]

162
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,360
That handsome guy was just

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
helping me take care of them for a bit.

164
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,999
Then when the kids' mom arrived,

165
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,959
he left quickly.

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,199
That's more like it.

167
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,720
Is he truly

168
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,480
a handsome guy?

169
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,680
Why don't I think so?

170
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,199
I think he's quite handsome.

171
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,199
So did you get his WeChat?

172
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:46,959
Of course.

173
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,680
Everyone wants to have a doctor friend.

174
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,280
[What's the issue, Mr. Yu?]

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Give me your phone.

176
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,240
Let me take a look at his Moments.

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
Uh, it's not quite appropriate.

178
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,680
Mr. Yu.

179
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,160
Aren't

180
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,399
Moments meant to

181
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,120
be seen

182
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,280
by friends?

183
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,680
Right?

184
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,840
I just want to know

185
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,240
who is with my daughters.

186
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,559
Let me take a look.

187
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,800
[Only 3 days of Moments are visible,]

188
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,519
it's too secretive.

189
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,759
What does he need to hide?

190
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,680
What kind of normal person

191
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,439
would set this?

192
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,840
Mr. Yu,

193
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
you can't say that.

194
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,920
My Moments are also the same.

195
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,999
You two seem quite compatible.

196
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,040
Really?

197
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,319
But

198
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,240
he's so much better than me.

199
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,759
He's a Doctor of Medicine after all.

200
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,639
Can't you be a bit more confident?

201
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,399
[You're]

202
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,519
already working now,

203
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,399
making your own money,

204
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,800
and earning your own living.

205
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,480
He, you know,

206
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
a thirty-year-old man,

207
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
is still a student

208
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,360
by now.

209
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:52,879
Right?

210
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,519
[He is still living off his parents.]

211
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
You're so much better than him.

212
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm telling you, I think you're

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,399
the best

214
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,680
in the whole company.

215
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,879
Really, Mr. Yu?

216
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,999
Alright then,

217
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,240
from now on,

218
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,040
keep in touch with him more often.

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,079
You're both young people

220
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,920
and have a lot in common, right?

221
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,240
[From now on,]

222
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,240
any expenses you have

223
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,199
from dating with him,

224
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
like transportation, or...

225
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
the cost of meals,

226
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
I'll cover them for you.

227
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,439
[How about that?]

228
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,600
Okay, thank you, Mr. Yu.

229
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,800
Well, if there's nothing else,

230
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,840
I'll head back.

231
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,160
I have work tomorrow morning.

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,079
Okay.

233
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,079
Keep it up.

234
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,879
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

235
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,120
Stay in touch with him.

236
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,559
Okay.

237
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,639
[Honey, honey.]

238
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,519
[Honey, I was wrong.]

239
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,080
[I heard you're not even eating.]

240
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,039
[How can you do this?]

241
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,960
[It's not good for your health.]

242
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,440
[Honey, I apologize]

243
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,759
[Don't worry, your child won't starve.]

244
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,279
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,879
I sincerely apologize to you.

246
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,080
I was wrong.

247
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,759
No,

248
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,720
it was me who's wrong.

249
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,039
Jia Haowen,

250
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
[It's me who should apologize.]

251
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,039
[I shouldn't investigate you,]

252
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,639
and ruin your image

253
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,999
in front of your ex-girlfriend.

254
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:14,440
I shouldn't have

255
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
messed up your business.

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,200
I've thought it over seriously,

257
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,960
what I did

258
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,039
was really wrong.

259
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,120
[I'm sorry.]

260
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:20,960
Don't be like this.

261
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,999
You're suddenly scaring me.

262
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:22,360
Honey,

263
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,080
[I was wrong.]

264
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,360
I'm apologizing to you, okay?

265
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:24,999
It is...

266
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,440
After the child is born,

267
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,320
let's just get divorced.

268
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,720
Is that okay?

269
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,639
Honey,

270
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,440
don't say that.

271
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,039
Our baby is going to be born.

272
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,120
You think just because I'm pregnant,

273
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,360
so I won't divorce you, right?

274
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,560
No, no, no, honey.

275
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,399
I don't wanna divorce at all.

276
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
I'm sincerely apologizing to you.

277
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,159
I was wrong.

278
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,600
Honey,

279
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,279
I know you love me, cherish me,

280
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,879
care about me, so you checked up on me.

281
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,320
Really, honey.

282
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,639
I'm apologizing to you, honey.

283
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,519
Look,

284
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,200
Xiongxiong is seven years old, right?

285
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:46,759
Our second baby

286
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,600
is about to be born soon.

287
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
Happy life is

288
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,879
still ahead.

289
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,879
[I don't want to be with you anymore.]

290
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,200
[You just live with the children.]

291
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,519
Your good life now

292
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,360
can go on without me.

293
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,960
Honey,

294
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,879
how can the child not have a mother?

295
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,679
Just find another one.

296
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,200
Now, anyone can be a mother.

297
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,159
Your eyes are only on the children,

298
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,600
right?

299
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,799
Honey,

300
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,480
you are the

301
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,759
happiest part of my life.

302
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,759
[Honey.]

303
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,360
Your life now

304
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,799
would be better without me.

305
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,679
You can find another woman,

306
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,799
and have two more children for you.

307
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,279
Aren't you wishing for more children?

308
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,039
Don't you want

309
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,679
a family portrait full of people?

310
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,200
[No, no.]

311
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,279
[Honey, it's not like that.]

312
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
You know Jia Haowen,

313
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
you know your husband very well.

314
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,720
My life dream is to grow old with

315
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,679
the woman I love.

316
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,360
My life dream

317
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,720
is to have babies with

318
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
the woman I love the most.

319
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,639
But I don't want

320
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,080
this kind of life.

321
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,519
Honey,

322
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,440
honey, honey,

323
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,080
I was wrong.

324
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,399
[I shouldn't have met my ex-girlfriend.]

325
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:28,720
[Really.]

326
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,759
[I apologize to you.]

327
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,879
I just went to see her

328
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,879
for work.

329
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,919
I was wrong. I shouldn't

330
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,080
have hidden this fact from you.

331
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,440
I just

332
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
thought it's better to avoid trouble.

333
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,679
It's my problem.

334
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,080
Anything else?

335
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,679
And, and...

336
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,399
I shouldn't

337
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,600
keep her WeChat, I'll delete her.

338
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,240
I shouldn't message her,

339
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,879
I'll delete it too.

340
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,080
I shouldn't contact her.

341
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,840
Is that all?

342
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,240
That's all.

343
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,440
Jia Haowen,

344
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,200
let's get divorced.

345
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,560
Look at Wanzhen,

346
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,399
even with two children,

347
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,560
she still gets divorced.

348
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,960
Early or late, they divorced.

349
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,639
Honey,

350
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,919
I'm not like her husband.

351
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,759
I will listen to you completely, right?

352
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,320
But I'm tired.

353
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,279
I want to let go of myself.

354
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,080
Jia Haowen,

355
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,799
I don't want to tail you anymore.

356
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,600
I don't want to check up on you.

357
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,679
It makes me seem so petty,

358
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,840
so foolish.

359
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,399
It makes me not like myself.

360
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,080
Life is so short.

361
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,560
I want to live for myself.

362
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
Now I'm just asking for trouble

363
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,519
to stay with you.

364
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,159
After the divorce,

365
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
you can do whatever you want.

366
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,759
It has nothing to do with me.

367
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,159
I'll be free.

368
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,519
I'll be liberated.

369
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,519
Jia Haowen,

370
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
just set me free.

371
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,600
Honey.

372
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,279
Haven't you ever thought about it?

373
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,080
I annoy you.

374
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,480
I'm so affected.

375
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
If we divorce,

376
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,879
you'll be free, too.

377
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,039
You'll be liberated.

378
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,279
Your life won't have to

379
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,480
revolve around me.

380
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,480
You can be in charge.

381
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,240
No, honey.

382
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,799
I'm willing to revolve around you.

383
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,679
I'm willing to let you be in charge.

384
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,879
I don't want to see you anymore.

385
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,039
Just let each other go, okay?

386
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,720
I just want to be with you.

387
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,799
Don't let go of me.

388
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,919
Let me go!

389
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,639
No, honey.

390
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,720
I don't want this family anymore.

391
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,600
I'll give it all to you.

392
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,240
Honey!

393
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,320
[Cheers, Mr. Zhou,]

394
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,159
[Try this liquor I brought back]

395
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,519
[from my business trip.]

396
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,159
Really?

397
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,720
What did you gain from the trip?

398
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,240
There's indeed a huge one.

399
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,360
I signed

400
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,759
an operations director

401
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,320
who worked for a big platform.

402
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,919
This time, our Blue Ocean

403
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,399
is going to upgrade significantly.

404
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,320
Upgrade

405
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,360
significantly?

406
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,600
Congratulations.

407
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Thanks for your blessing.

408
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,120
Just try the liquor first.

409
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,440
Not bad.

410
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,080
Uh,

411
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,480
the era of

412
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,799
the wild growth of

413
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,480
the new media

414
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,600
has passed.

415
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,960
[So,]

416
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,840
[the Blue Ocean also needs to]

417
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,080
[upgrade systematically.]

418
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,120
Otherwise,

419
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,039
it will be eliminated

420
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,720
by this era.

421
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,320
That's right.

422
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:22,919
Be prepared for the future.

423
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,960
In the past, the era of the wild,

424
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,600
with boldness and unorthodox methods,

425
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,720
one could survive.

426
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,639
Now the industry

427
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,480
is becoming more regulated.

428
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,080
If Mr. Yu has such

429
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
ability and determination,

430
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,440
I think the future of Blue Ocean

431
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,240
is limitless.

432
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,679
Thank you.

433
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,879
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

434
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,600
With your words,

435
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,840
I feel so reassured.

436
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:40,879
Cheers.

437
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,799
Come on.

438
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,120
Thank you.

439
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,879
Let's not talk about work today,

440
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:48,720
just drink.

441
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,360
Alright.

442
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,080
Okay.

443
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,200
You see, I always have this problem,

444
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,039
all my affairs

445
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,399
revolve around work.

446
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,600
[I work during the day,]

447
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,519
[and then at night,]

448
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,240
[there still are many social events]

449
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,600
[that need to be cope with.]

450
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,159
In the future, I must learn from you,

451
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,159
once work is over,

452
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
I will just enjoy a glass of wine

453
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,519
[and put work matters]

454
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,519
[behind me.]

455
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,120
Let myself have a fully relax,

456
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,600
and empty all the trivial things

457
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,519
out of my mind

458
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,960
to work better

459
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,999
the next day.

460
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,960
In the future, when you're free,

461
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,320
you can invite me more often.

462
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,759
We'll be drinking companions from now on.

463
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,440
Alright,

464
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,480
that's my pleasure.

465
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,360
Mr. Zhou,

466
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,560
you've

467
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,720
seen a lot,

468
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,200
I do have a question

469
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,120
to ask you.

470
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,080
What, your friend

471
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,840
has another issue?

472
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,519
Yes,

473
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,360
no, no, it's not.

474
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,560
it's just a

475
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,919
social issue.

476
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,720
I figure it is a

477
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,679
social issue.

478
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,799
[You say now,]

479
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,159
is there

480
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
more and more cradle snatchers?

481
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,519
[And I don't understand,]

482
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,039
why do those young guys

483
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,440
insist on finding

484
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,960
an elder woman

485
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,279
with a family

486
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,919
and children?

487
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
[What are they after?]

488
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,679
Well, the issue you mentioned,

489
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,279
I think,

490
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,480
young guys

491
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,600
have a purer view of love.

492
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
Look, they don't care any conditions,

493
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,960
no matter how old the woman is,

494
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,399
and whether she's been married before,

495
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,159
even don't care if she has children.

496
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,799
He must be very pure.

497
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,159
He only cares about the person.

498
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,120
But then,

499
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,720
you know,

500
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,120
the elder woman

501
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,039
has already married with

502
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,840
other people

503
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,320
and even has their kids.

504
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:28,799
[How can he]

505
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,919
[still hook up her like this?]

506
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,519
[Even without any reaction,]

507
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,039
he still actively helps

508
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,600
to take care of her children.

509
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,399
I think

510
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,799
he must be after something.

511
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,919
[Maybe he's after]

512
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,120
[her wealth,]

513
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,399
and wants to make himself

514
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,600
earn more wealth by it.

515
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,600
That's not necessarily the case.

516
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,560
The woman who has been

517
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
divorced and has children

518
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,960
will be more pragmatic.

519
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:46,840
Additionally, there is

520
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,200
legal protection for personal property.

521
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,480
It's not that easy to cheat money.

522
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,600
That's true.

523
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,960
There's also the law

524
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,759
to protect it.

525
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:57,960
And

526
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
the friend of mine,

527
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,840
I know her very well,

528
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,519
[you know.]

529
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,560
[She's a]

530
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,759
[fairly calm person.]

531
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,240
But I don't understand,

532
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,999
this young guy,

533
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,080
what is he after?

534
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,960
This actually shows that

535
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,679
[the young guy is very mature mentally.]

536
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,919
[He can look after her children.]

537
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,360
A young guy,

538
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
can help a woman with her children.

539
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,080
What does this show?

540
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
This is true love.

541
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,320
[In today's society,]

542
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,719
[love can't withstand the test.]

543
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,080
The love that can withstand such tests

544
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,760
must be true love.

545
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,320
Mr. Zhou,

546
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,000
which side are you on?

547
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,479
What is your stance?

548
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,719
Of course, I'm on your side.

549
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,199
So...

550
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:32,959
you can talk

551
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,159
from both sides?

552
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,040
You asked for my opinion,

553
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm telling it like it is.

554
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,399
[Really, this is true love]

555
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:39,120
[in my opinion.]

556
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,600
Whatever, let's finish it.

557
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,520
I...should go first.

558
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,000
No more drink?

559
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,800
Yeah.

560
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,159
I have to work tomorrow.

561
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,239
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou. Good night.

562
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,040
Alright, take care.

563
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,199
Done.

564
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,080
Look at the skin,

565
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,439
just like a peeled egg.

566
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,760
Don't touch me.

567
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:07,959
I'm your mom.

568
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,199
What's wrong with touching you?

569
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:10,760
Don't be handsy.

570
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:11,959
[I'm still upset about the case]

571
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:12,800
you fooled me.

572
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:16,479
Dad,

573
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
[are you packed?]

574
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,719
[Notebooks, books, test papers,]

575
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,280
[all set.]

576
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,959
Alright, thank you, Dad.

577
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,280
Dad, good job.

578
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,840
Yunjie, look,

579
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,560
you're fourteen now.

580
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,280
You should do it by yourself.

581
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:36,159
I can't pack for you

582
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,280
all the time.

583
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,199
Okay.

584
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:38,919
Dad,

585
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,360
the more time you help me pack,

586
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,879
the more time I'll love you.

587
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,959
Mwah.

588
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,520
That's too much.

589
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,679
Alright, that's enough.

590
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,760
Stop acting, she left.

591
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,760
What's the matter?

592
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,879
The atmosphere was quite good

593
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,959
just now while watching TV.

594
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,360
War between women,

595
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,199
you won't understand.

596
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,760
War?

597
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,080
Then I'll stay out of it.

598
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,159
It's too scary.

599
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,520
Be careful not to get hit by mistake.

600
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:14,719
Sleep.

601
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,360
Good night.

602
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,520
[Don't stay up late.]

603
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,280
Milk.

604
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:31,959
Did you comfort her alone?

605
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,479
Just a kid,

606
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,120
a little comfort isn't big deal.

607
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,360
Besides,

608
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,800
we were wrong to hide it in the beginning,

609
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,600
[right?]

610
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,560
[Look,]

611
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,080
[I just took advantage of checking]

612
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:45,040
her homework to comfort her a bit,

613
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,159
and it'll be fine, won't it?

614
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,360
That's all?

615
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,919
And then gave her a piece of chocolate.

616
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,280
I knew it,

617
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,520
what's wrong with you?

618
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,959
You are always the good person,

619
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:57,479
and I'm the only one

620
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,040
playing the bad cop in this family.

621
00:19:59,439 --> 00:19:59,959
Don't worry.

622
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,800
I'll play the bad cop in the future.

623
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,439
Alright?

624
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:03,159
I will.

625
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,639
Old bad cop.

626
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,120
I'm your old bad cop.

627
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,879
Come on,

628
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,560
go to sleep.

629
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,879
Are you

630
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,040
staring at the phone

631
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:24,919
and trying to meditate?

632
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:26,919
Xin hasn't

633
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,520
sent me a message yet.

634
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:31,879
Maybe Haowen is at home

635
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,520
kneeling on a washboard right now,

636
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,000
So she has no time to answer you.

637
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:36,520
You

638
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:38,159
didn't see it?

639
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,600
They had a big fight today.

640
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,760
I think Haowen is really angry.

641
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,199
He is really angry?

642
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,320
How dare him!

643
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,560
He dares to be angry?

644
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:50,520
What will he do when he's angry?

645
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,280
Never seen it.

646
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,360
When a child is quiet,

647
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,719
he must be up to something.

648
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,080
You're overthinking.

649
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,600
Xin is already mature enough.

650
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,560
She's almost a second-time mom.

651
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,760
Xin,

652
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,679
has Haowen back home yet?

653
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,159
No matter how old she is,

654
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,360
she's still a child in my eyes.

655
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,439
Do you think she has

656
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,360
depression during pregnancy now?

657
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,679
Impossible.

658
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,239
Even if

659
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,120
she has depression,

660
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,320
she has Haowen.

661
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,280
As long as you're not, it's fine.

662
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,239
[He's back.]

663
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,280
[We were taking a walk downstairs.]

664
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,479
See, what I said?

665
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,959
It's their own business,

666
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,520
There's no need to be worried.

667
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,199
How should I do things

668
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,320
that make me neither

669
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
fish nor fowl everyday.

670
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
[Exercise?]

671
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,159
Is the door closed?

672
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,360
No, it's not.

673
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,159
I'll close it.

674
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Just let me do it.

675
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,239
Xin,

676
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,679
[why you are back now?]

677
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,040
You're not asleep yet?

678
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,479
Hurry up,

679
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,959
why are you backing so late at night?

680
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,479
[Haowen's...mom came.]

681
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,159
[Dad, help me.]

682
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,080
[So]

683
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,159
[I don't need to]

684
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,639
[take care of the kids now.]

685
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,280
[You know the character of her.]

686
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,520
[she's a good person,]

687
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
[but her educational philosophy]

688
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,760
[is different from mine.]

689
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,520
[So, you know...]

690
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,919
[Conflict again.]

691
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,080
[I don't know]

692
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,120
[how to handle it.]

693
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:39,040
[So,]

694
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:39,959
[I come back home.]

695
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,120
[It's good]

696
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,520
to be home,

697
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,800
and enjoy some leisure.

698
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,280
Yes.

699
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,399
Just let her

700
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,479
get close to her grandson.

701
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,120
Exactly.

702
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm hungry.

703
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,239
What do you want to eat?

704
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,479
There are many foods in the fridge.

705
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,719
Wontons.

706
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,199
Be quick.

707
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:00,159
Wait for a moment.

708
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,080
These past two days have worn me out.

709
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,360
Honey,

710
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,840
I used to

711
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,479
think that the acting

712
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:36,959
on TV is so

713
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,000
simple.

714
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,719
But now I've

715
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,000
changed my mind.

716
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,199
I think acting

717
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,520
is not simple.

718
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,120
You're better than them.

719
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,959
Aren't they all saying

720
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,040
that those who act in life

721
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,919
are the real actors?

722
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,760
You've outperformed them.

723
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,800
What about you?

724
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,320
Let me interview you.

725
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,679
How do you feel now?

726
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,280
To be honest?

727
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,919
Wronged.

728
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,040
What are you wronged about?

729
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,679
I feel wronged for my daughter.

730
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,159
What grievance can she have?

731
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,040
Look at her,

732
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,760
she can't be happy and healthy more.

733
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,719
She's a happy angel.

734
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,280
Come on.

735
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,320
You don't understand.

736
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Being the eldest child is very wronged.

737
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,719
In short,

738
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,199
if the second one makes some trouble,

739
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,879
don't you have to take the blame?

740
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,719
If he's wronged,

741
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,120
don't you have to comfort him?

742
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,239
If he's disobedient,

743
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,280
don't you have to discipline him?

744
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,520
And he's still unhappy.

745
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:37,800
Just

746
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,040
think about Mengxin,

747
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,760
understand?

748
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,840
As soon as I think about Yunjie's life,

749
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,320
she's going to suffer my experience.

750
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:46,120
Wait a minute,

751
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,080
what did you say?

752
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,479
The grievances of the eldest?

753
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,760
Then what about the second child?

754
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,760
Enough.

755
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,600
what grievances can he has?

756
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,800
The bitterness of the second kid

757
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,919
is deeper than the sea.

758
00:24:58,919 --> 00:24:59,840
That's enough.

759
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,719
Don't be ungrateful for your happiness.

760
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,320
I tell you,

761
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,159
when I think about this,

762
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,320
I feel very wronged.

763
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,600
In short,

764
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,679
the second child,

765
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,600
in addition to mom and dad,

766
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,840
there's also an elder sister or brother

767
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,879
who's watching over you

768
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,719
and restraining you.

769
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:14,479
Isn't it good?

770
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,520
Is it good?

771
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,360
Just tell me,

772
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:18,800
when Mengxin was young,

773
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,600
did she ever wear

774
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,760
clothes you've worn?

775
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,560
Yes, so?

776
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,760
Me, too.

777
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,600
You wore your sister's clothes?

778
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:33,439
Yeah,

779
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,080
I did wear her clothes

780
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,479
and went to school.

781
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,679
Isn't that embarrassing?

782
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,199
Didn't they tailor them at all?

783
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,159
Yes, but...

784
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,399
they're still women's clothes.

785
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,600
The clothes I wore

786
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,600
were second-hand.

787
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,280
The things I used

788
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,080
were second-hand,

789
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,159
even the food I ate

790
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:54,520
was second-hand.

791
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,080
All were second-hand.

792
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,919
Am I second-hand?

793
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,800
What about me?

794
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,280
No, you're not.

795
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:05,719
She has no comments

796
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,000
on our relation.

797
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,399
And

798
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,000
anything else?

799
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,520
Even now

800
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,760
she's still in control of me

801
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
and you,

802
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:15,520
right?

803
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,520
She even controls the dispensing

804
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,479
of medicines.

805
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,199
Right?

806
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,080
Remote control.

807
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,199
Is it uncomfortable?

808
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,760
But I can understand her.

809
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,560
Being the eldest sister is not easy.

810
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,000
So you second children's actions

811
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,159
are all about the desire to survive,

812
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,199
and want to be noticed, right?

813
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
Isn't that troublesome?

814
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,719
If both children

815
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:48,159
have grievances,

816
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,239
should we still

817
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:50,719
have the second child?

818
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,159
Why not?

819
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,120
Honey, there will be no such problems

820
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,639
in our family for sure.

821
00:26:58,639 --> 00:26:59,679
For our family, having two children

822
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,800
has no problem at all.

823
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,360
Just take it easy.

824
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,000
Anyone has grievances.

825
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,320
Isn't it?

826
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:09,120
That's true.

827
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,959
It's not even a grievance for a family.

828
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,719
But then again,

829
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:14,320
as for the education

830
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,639
of our children in the future,

831
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,719
if they have conflicts

832
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,239
at home,

833
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,360
let them resolve it by themselves.

834
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,560
We shouldn't interfere.

835
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,439
If they can't solve it

836
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
and ask us,

837
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,879
then our four family members

838
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,439
will discuss it together.

839
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:29,760
Okay?

840
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:31,600
Okay.

841
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,239
Be fair.

842
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,600
Be democratic.

843
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,679
Build a harmonious home.

844
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,479
Yes.

845
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:40,959
When you are available,

846
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,919
go back to mom's home and take a look.

847
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:43,639
Are the things

848
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:44,959
Yunjie used

849
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,040
still there?

850
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:47,760
Let's just

851
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,320
throw all away.

852
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,959
We definitely don't have any.

853
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,360
What an era it is now!

854
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,320
Life is affluent, right?

855
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,760
And Yunjie is fourteen already.

856
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,159
Even if we want to use it, it's no way.

857
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:05,520
Uh...

858
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,159
I'm really overthinking.

859
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,120
Let's sleep?

860
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,159
Okay.

861
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,120
Okay.

862
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,560
Well,

863
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,760
sleep.

864
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,360
We

865
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,919
don't feel wronged when falling asleep.

866
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,600
So comfortable.

867
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,679
It's really nice to be home.

868
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,080
Everything tastes good.

869
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,320
Just eat more.

870
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
I need to make my little grandson

871
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,159
sturdy.

872
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,439
Dad, look at mom,

873
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,520

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,839
See?

1047
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,359
That's the boss.

1048
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,560
Hard work isn't just a slogan

1049
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,639
for our boss.

1050
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:14,880
Fighting.

1051
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,359
Dr. Yu.

1052
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:20,920
Miss Chen.

1053
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,719
Thank you.

1054
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,759
I should be the one appreciating.

1055
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,759
You accompanied my children so late.

1056
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,440
Well,

1057
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,880
I hope you don't mind.

1058
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,839
I just saw that

1059
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,440
the children were unwilling to

1060
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,759
open the door for that little girl.

1061
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,000
After I confirmed her identity,

1062
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,839
then I brought her up.

1063
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,440
And the kids wanted to play with me,

1064
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,319
so I stayed.

1065
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,199
I know.

1066
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,600
But I still have to thank you.

1067
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,920
You're so busy with work everyday,

1068
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,440
it took up your rest time.

1069
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:43,799
It's okay.

1070
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,319
I like kids anyway.

1071
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:46,080
Otherwise, why would I

1072
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:47,520
choose major in pediatrics, right?

1073
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,159
Hello, are you Chen Wanzhen?

1074
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:51,560
Yes, I am.

1075
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:52,759
Your books, please check.

1076
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:53,719
Alright, thank you.

1077
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,600
You bought so many books.

1078
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,440
I signed up for a class.

1079
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,080
[Really?]

1080
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,759
Are you still taking classes?

1081
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:04,839
Just a hobby class.

1082
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,799
I can't compare with a doctor

1083
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:06,560
like you.

1084
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:08,960
I heard from Wanwan that

1085
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,440
you used to be a top student, too.

1086
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:11,679
Don't take it seriously.

1087
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
The things I've learned,

1088
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,199
I've given it all back to teachers.

1089
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,520
So I need to start learning again.

1090
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,440
You have classes and work,

1091
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,319
that's so busy.

1092
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,839
How about let me take care of the kids?

1093
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,400
Thank you,

1094
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,719
I can manage on my own.

1095
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,199
Don't get me wrong.

1096
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,400
I didn't mean that.

1097
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,040
I mean,

1098
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,279
I could take them out

1099
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:27,199
to the interest classes or something.

1100
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:27,759
I won't be alone

1101
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:28,560
with them.

1102
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,600
If you're worried,

1103
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,520
I can have aunt accompany us.

1104
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
I'm not worried.

1105
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,199
I just think it's too much trouble.

1106
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:35,040
You doctors already have

1107
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
a demanding work,

1108
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,239
and you're also studying.

1109
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,319
I've already hired a full-time nanny

1110
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:39,279
for them.

1111
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,040
It's not a big deal.

1112
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,120
Then I'll go back to my room first.

1113
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,040
Okay, bye.

1114
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:45,799
Bye.

1115
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,600
Thank you.

1116
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,199
Did the surgery fail?

1117
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,920
What do you mean by fail?

1118
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,759
The front desk said you come back

1119
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:19,239
early before your leave is over.

1120
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,440
[why else would you be back?]

1121
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,120
Yes, failed,

1122
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,839
failed.

1123
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,319
Why do you come back early?

1124
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,920
At least you take your vacation over.

1125
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,799
Since I'm planning to have a baby,

1126
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:31,799
aren't I supposed to hurry back

1127
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:32,799
to work?

1128
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:33,920
You want to work, right?

1129
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,359
Alright, then I'm leaving.

1130
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,159
No, no, no.

1131
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:37,639
Just sit down.

1132
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:38,600
Come on.

1133
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,440
Just tell me,

1134
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,799
what happened in the company

1135
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,080
while I was away.

1136
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
The headhunter recommended

1137
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,040
a few deputy directors to Zhang.

1138
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,120
None of them

1139
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,239
were suitable.

1140
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,440
What about Huang Sisi?

1141
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,799
No news for a long time.

1142
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:54,560
She's on the same level

1143
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,359
as me at Blue Ocean.

1144
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,000
It's probably hard to negotiate.

1145
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,639
She can't compare with you.

1146
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:02,000
Everyone in the industry knows

1147
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,319
about her and Yu Hai.

1148
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,080
Without the platform of Blue Ocean,

1149
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,520
her true worth

1150
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,759
will be revealed.

1151
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:10,239
We can't say that.

1152
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,920
What if she's a rising star?

1153
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Then you, a veteran, should be careful.

1154
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,520
[Since you wanna have a second child,]

1155
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:17,159
it's time to focus on building a team.

1156
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,799
Promoting Mu should be

1157
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:19,839
put on the agenda.

1158
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,600
I'll go to Zhang's office and

1159
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,239
drop some hints.

1160
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,799
Thank you

1161
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:24,560
for standing with me.

1162
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:25,239
No.

1163
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,920
I'm doing this for the stability

1164
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,159
and unity of the company.

1165
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,279
Then tell me the truth.

1166
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,359
Are you really afraid that

1167
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,239
I'll have a second child

1168
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,759
and quit my job?

1169
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,799
No, no, no.

1170
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:35,880
You're overthinking it.

1171
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,120
I'm afraid of those young people.

1172
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,279
They might disrupt the workplace

1173
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,400
at any moment and leave.

1174
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:42,560
As for someone like you,

1175
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:44,400
a middle-aged person with family,

1176
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,319
soon to have another mouth to feed,

1177
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,400
would you dare to resign?

1178
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:49,040
Why would I be afraid of you?

1179
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,000
It seems a little bit reasonable.

1180
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:55,120
You have a good grasp of psychology.

1181
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:55,880
For sure.

1182
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,319
Who am I?

1183
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,799
I'm professional.

1184
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,199
Impressive.

1185
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,520
Respect.

1186
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:03,520
Mr. Zhang.

1187
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,520
You're back.

1188
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:05,679
Why didn't you

1189
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,759
tell me beforehand?

1190
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:07,159
I have some issue,

1191
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,000
come with me.

1192
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,319
Officially back to work.

1193
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,880
Look at you,

1194
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,719
your complexion

1195
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,920
is much better after the leave.

1196
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,719
I just get excited

1197
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,960
as soon as I'm back.

1198
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,319
I have a

1199
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,679
real estate project here

1200
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,799
from Hua Xiang Real Estate.

1201
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,040
Take a look at the project document.

1202
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,199
[Real estate project.]

1203
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,920
We might need to visit the site.

1204
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:33,480
Well,

1205
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:33,920
I'll go there

1206
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,120
later with my team.

1207
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
You're still so reliable

1208
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,639
and can always provide the efficiency.

1209
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,120
[Alright,]

1210
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,279
[you do the field inspection,]

1211
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,799
I'll

1212
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:40,600
arrange to meet with Mr. Qian.

1213
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,400
Let's make a concentrated effort

1214
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,319
these days and get the project.

1215
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:43,920
Okay,

1216
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,159
I will go back.

1217
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:57,839
Okay.

1218
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,199
Thank you, sir.

1219
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,839
Okay.

1220
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:00,759
Take care.

1221
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,440
Bye.

1222
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,440
Xiongxiong.

1223
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:09,960
Grandma,

1224
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:12,120
grandma, I miss you.

1225
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,839
Sweetheart,

1226
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:16,400
I miss you too.

1227
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:17,520
Xiongxiong,

1228
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,759
why didn't you go to school today?

1229
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:23,199
Dad and mom are getting a divorce,

1230
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,120
how can I still go to school?

1231
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,000
Divorce?

1232
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,400
Haowen.

1233
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,480
Mom.

1234
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,560
What happened between you and Xin?

1235
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,759
Why are you here?

1236
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,159
What's going on?

1237
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,159
I bumped into something.

1238
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Crap!

1239
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:48,480
Did Xin hit you?

1240
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:49,920
It's not, mom.

1241
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,199
Just stay out of it.

1242
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,120
Look at this,

1243
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,440
how could she hit so hard?

1244
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:54,759
It is really...

1245
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:55,799
It must be painful.

1246
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,560
Mom.

1247
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,560
It's not a hit.

1248
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,159
I just feel bad for you.

1249
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,440
It's okay, mom.

1250
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,040
Why are you so timid?

1251
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,199
Getting hit by a woman.

1252
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,600
Don't talk like that, mom.

1253
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,600
Look at you.

1254
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:10,480
Doesn't it hurt?

1255
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,520
Not at all, mom.

1256
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,199
Did Xin get up yet?

1257
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,520
Not yet.

1258
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,600
Don't worry.

1259
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:26,839
Haowen will come soon.

1260
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:29,799
[Mrs. Xu,]

1261
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,239
[are you at home?]

1262
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:33,799
Here I am.

1263
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Is anybody here?

1264
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,799
We are home.

1265
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:37,960
Mrs. Xu.

1266
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:38,679
Why

1267
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:39,799
are you here?

1268
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
Welcome.

1269
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
I just come to visit you.

1270
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,120
No need to bring gifts.

1271
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,159
Just take a sit.

1272
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,159
Okay, thank you.

1273
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:46,679
Let me take a look.

1274
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,239
Please sit down.

1275
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,239
Thank you.

1276
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,920
You come here alone?

1277
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,600
Yes.

1278
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,480
Well, sit down.

1279
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,319
Okay.

1280
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:52,920
Alright,

1281
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,159
you two chat,

1282
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,880
I'll go buy some groceries.

1283
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,359
It's really bothering you.

1284
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:57,759
Just sit here.

1285
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,600
Come on.

1286
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,279
Have a rest.

1287
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,239
[Okay.]

1288
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:03,199
Thank you.

1289
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,359
Why are you

1290
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,799
getting younger and younger?

1291
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,520
Really?

1292
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,239
Your complexion is getting better.

1293
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:13,040
Just so so.

1294
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,239
This courtyard

1295
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,199
is well maintained,

1296
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,920
and is getting better and better.

1297
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,920
So comfortable.

1298
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,400
Look at this,

1299
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,239
this rockery, rocks,

1300
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,199
water,

1301
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,560
and trees.

1302
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,759
It's all thanks to my husband.

1303
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,199
So nice.

1304
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:31,560
Didn't

1305
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,480
your old house

1306
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,520
also get turned into a big villa?

1307
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,080
Yes.

1308
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,960
It must be comfortable, too.

1309
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,799
Yes,

1310
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
thanks to the children.

1311
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,759
So...

1312
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,120
Did Xin come back yesterday?

1313
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,440
Yes.

1314
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,279
She's pregnant, you know,

1315
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:50,319
so she gets tired easily.

1316
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:51,920
and she hasn't gotten up yet.

1317
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,120
So we let her sleep a bit longer.

1318
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,920
The doctor said that

1319
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,440
those who are about to

1320
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:57,920
give birth can't always

1321
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,319
lie down.

1322
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,960
[They need to do more exercises,]

1323
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,759
[which is good for the delivery.]

1324
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,520
Just take it easy.

1325
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,120
[Xin doesn't have time]

1326
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,560
[to always lie down.]

1327
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:08,319
You see,

1328
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,520
Haowen is so busy all the time.

1329
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:12,239
Nearly all the housework

1330
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,600
is done by her alone.
