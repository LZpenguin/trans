00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:46,331
Just in Time EP29

3
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,359
This is the summary of my work

4
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,359
and my work plan

5
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,039
for the next phase.

6
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,199
Looks good.

7
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,719
Your thoughts are clear,

8
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,879
and goals, too.

9
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,800
Through my observation of you

10
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
during this period,

11
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,840
I've noticed

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,160
that you are someone who is

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
goal-oriented

14
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,919
and has strong execution skills.

15
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,719
Thank you for the recognition.

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,679
Actually,

17
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,040
these tasks

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,279
are pretty basic for me.

19
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,679
After this period

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,239
of getting familiar with Xinmiao,

21
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,639
this is what I think,

22
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,440
Director,

23
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,400
I want to, while completing

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,480
the tasks you've assigned me,

25
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,919
also push forward

26
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,440
the tasks assigned by Mr. Zhang.

27
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Is that okay with you?

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,840
No problem at all.

29
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
Mr. Zhang already approved it.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,720
The point is, can you handle it all?

31
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,679
This workload is

32
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,520
nothing compared to that when I was

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,959
the Content Director at Blue Ocean.

34
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,760
It's a piece of cake.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,999
But I heard recently

36
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:50,560
that the overtime work is piling up.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,479
Did someone

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,360
complain to you?

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,440
No, they wouldn't dare.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,440
They're all young people.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,679
What's wrong with working more overtime?

42
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,560
They gain experience that's beneficial

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,720
to their development.

44
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:04,920
It's good for their growth.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,640
Right?

46
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,319
Yes.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,479
But as leaders,

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,720
sometimes,

49
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,039
we need to consider

50
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,160
everyone's feelings.

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,080
Understood.

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,200
I'll keep that in mind.

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,239
But, Director Xu,

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,160
actually, Mr. Zhang

55
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,959
only cares about results in the end.

56
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,160
So when it's time to push hard,

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
we have to push hard.

58
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,920
Wouldn't you agree?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,679
Sure.

60
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,119
Did you take in

61
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,599
everything I just said?

62
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,319
This company isn't just yours.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,759
You have to be responsible

64
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,640
to the shareholders and employees.

65
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:53,999
Look at your

66
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,159
current work state,

67
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,040
slacking off half the time.

68
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,040
Is this acceptable?

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,760
Chairman,

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,399
excuse me, I need to take a call.

71
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,040
Mengxin.

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,600
The baby keeps crying?

73
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,719
Why is that?

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,719
Jia Haowen,

75
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,159
find me a nanny right away,

76
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,559
a certified one, understand?

77
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,320
Okay, okay, I'll do it ASAP. Honey.

78
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,279
Don't worry.

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,480
I have something to do now.

80
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:19,959
Okay.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,159
Think carefully about what I said.

82
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm leaving now.

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,920
Chairman,

84
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,520
stay for dinner before you go.

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,640
You know what?

86
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,719
You better go home for your wife.

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,119
Most people marry

88
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,640
for a supportive wife.

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,719
But you, you married a goddess

90
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,800
to worship.

91
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,999
Chairman, the main point is...

92
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,040
Having a baby isn't something

93
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,200
that happens often in a lifetime.

94
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,839
But isn't she off work right now?

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,040
She can't even take care

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,159
of the child at home all day?

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,559
She had a C-section.

98
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,360
Recovery's not going well.

99
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,159
You take maternity leave.

100
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,239
But the executives at other companies

101
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,399
aren't taking time off.

102
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,159
Listen,

103
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:01,880
if you miss

104
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,800
this opportunity,

105
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,640
don't blame our partners

106
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,920
for pulling the rug out from under you.

107
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,520
Since everyone chose you

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,679
to be the general manager,

109
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,480
you're responsible

110
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,279
for their money.

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,559
Goodbye, Chairman.

112
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,320
Bye-bye.

113
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,480
What are you staring at?

114
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,679
What opportunity did I miss?

115
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,399
Why wasn't I informed?

116
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,559
You missed the last board meeting.

117
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,839
I sent you the minutes.

118
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,880
You could've sent them again.

119
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,320
I've been reminding you non-stop.

120
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,399
By the way,

121
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
here are the materials

122
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,520
from that last meeting.

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Fine, I'll look them over at home.

124
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,159
Mr. Jia,

125
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,760
there are a few documents

126
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,200
that need your signature.

127
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,119
Later. Don't bother me right now.

128
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,520
Please don't forget!

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,959
Unbelievable!

130
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,680
What's wrong, kiddo?

131
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,719
There. There.

132
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,599
She pooped!

133
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,719
Gotta clean up.

134
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:10,520
I can handle it.

135
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,799
Ma'am, I've sanitized my hands.

136
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,320
Okay.

137
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,399
Alright.

138
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,120
I'll do it, I'll do it.

139
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:14,839
Here, here.

140
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,640
Be careful.

141
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,719
Got it.

142
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,320
Let's go.

143
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Hurry up!

144
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,959
Good kid.

145
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,320
There. There.

146
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,839
Jia Haowen,

147
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,599
don't come home tonight

148
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,719
unless you find a nanny!

149
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:41,599
Got you some bubble tea.

150
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:42,240
Thanks.

151
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:44,640
So, how'd it go?

152
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,680
Nothing to say.

153
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,520
If we have a fight,

154
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,799
she would be the loser.

155
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
Then start competing!

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,080
Not gonna happen.

157
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,799
Her main job right now

158
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,080
is to help me transition smoothly.

159
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,279
If I start competing with her now,

160
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,560
how am I supposed to have a baby?

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,080
I've got an idea.

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,719
I'm not sure if I should say it.

163
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:04,359
Tell me!

164
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,399
You can't hold it back.

165
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,839
I'll suggest to Mr. Zhang

166
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,479
to split the Content Department

167
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,719
into two parts

168
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,520
and have Huang Sisi focus on

169
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,640
expanding new business,

170
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,039
so she doesn't resort

171
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,080
to underhanded methods to take over.

172
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,959
As for you,

173
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,839
you just need to stick to your turf.

174
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:19,919
How does that sound?

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,399
The Content Department was just merged.

176
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:24,440
Can we really split it now?

177
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
History shows that what's long united

178
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,799
will eventually split, and vice versa.

179
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,399
You have to adapt to the times.

180
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,520
If we separate her out,

181
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,279
she'll be independent.

182
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,279
She'll make her own decisions.

183
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,599
She'll definitely agree.

184
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,680
What do you think of this plan?

185
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
It's not a bad idea.

186
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,440
I'm pretty sharp,

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,080
it'd be a waste not to be a boss.

188
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,719
Just let me chill.

189
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:53,919
What's wrong?

190
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,640
High risk in Down syndrome screening.

191
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,520
High risk?

192
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,760
Look at my doll.

193
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,279
See?

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,919
Even though yours is golden,

195
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,880
mine is a bit pinker.

196
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Definitely from a good store.

197
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,120
What do you think?

198
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,440
Do you like

199
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,279
daddy's gifts?

200
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,159
Yes!

201
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,159
Thank you, daddy!

202
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,080
What would you

203
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
like to eat later?

204
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,760
I want pizza.

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,279
I want to go home to see mommy.

206
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,240
Sis,

207
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,039
now that you mention it,

208
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,359
I miss mommy a bit too.

209
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,039
But look,

210
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,560
every week daddy only has

211
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,719
this one day to see you.

212
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,240
Daddy misses you all the time.

213
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,760
Don't you miss Daddy?

214
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,719
But mommy is home alone

215
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,159
and has no one to have dinner with.

216
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,560
Actually, 85% of

217
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,039
marriages

218
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,520
can be saved.

219
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,440
Just utilize the resources of marriage.

220
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,039
For example,

221
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,479
you can create some

222
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,279
heartwarming moments

223
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,200
between parents and kids.

224
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,440
How about this?

225
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,479
Let's get some pizza first,

226
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,520
and then go home

227
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,680
and have dinner with your mommy.

228
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,240
How does that sound?

229
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,399
Great!

230
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Alright!

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,039
Let's first get the pizza,

232
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,919
then head home.

233
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,719
Sounds good?

234
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,440
Wonderful!

235
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,440
Don't worry, it's not porridge this time,

236
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,399
or noodles.

237
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
It's a healthy meal I made myself.

238
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,599
Quinoa salad.

239
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,799
Dr. Yu,

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,959
I'll clean the lunchbox and

241
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,839
return it to you after I finish eating.

242
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,839
Thank you, you're a great neighbor.

243
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,039
We should use an outsourced team

244
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,279
to cut costs.

245
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,320
Labor costs

246
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
are our biggest operating expenses.

247
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,959
Yes, it reduces costs.

248
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:08,799
That's quite good.

249
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,440
But this...

250
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,680
This outsourcing...

251
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,399
I still feel a bit uneasy about it.

252
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,680
Is there a problem?

253
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,680
It's about quality control.

254
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,479
I feel...

255
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:18,760
Meng'an.

256
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,360
Director Xu.

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,279
Am I interrupting?

258
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:20,919
No, not at all.

259
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,640
Come in, come in.

260
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,439
Just in time to try the tea

261
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:24,640
that Sisi gave me.

262
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,199
No need.

263
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,480
I'm here to ask for leave.

264
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,480
I have a prenatal checkup.

265
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,880
I might need to go.

266
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,319
It will take three days.

267
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
What kind of checkup?

268
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,520
It takes three days?

269
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,559
High risk in Down syndrome screening.

270
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,840
I might need to do a surgery.

271
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,559
That's serious!

272
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,799
Three days? Is it enough for you?

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,079
Should be enough.

274
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,640
At your age... Jesus!

275
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,399
Sit down, Director Xu.

276
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:54,880
During pregnancy...

277
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:55,840
I can't sit.

278
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,880
Pregnant women...

279
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,199
It's not good to sit for long periods.

280
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,240
Meng'an,

281
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to tell you,

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,760
you've been working

283
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,199
too hard lately.

284
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,919
With your two deputy directors

285
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,799
in place,

286
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,480
you can delegate

287
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,559
tasks to them.

288
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,559
Your main job is to protect your fetus.

289
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,279
We'll handle the work.

290
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,919
Director Xu, please take more rest.

291
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,279
Okay.

292
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,480
Well, um...

293
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,399
Sisi seems to have something

294
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,559
to discuss with you.

295
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,039
I think Director Xu

296
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,799
will definitely support this matter.

297
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,199
Alright, you can talk.

298
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,199
Baby, please stop crying.

299
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:47,720
What's wrong?

300
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Let me handle it.

301
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,520
Is she hungry?

302
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,480
How could that be?

303
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,000
She was fed just an hour ago.

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,919
So,

305
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,520
she wasn't full earlier?

306
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,679
Mom.

307
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you always think

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,559
I don't have enough milk

309
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
and my daughter is hungry?

310
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,799
No, no, absolutely not.

311
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,880
Hey!

312
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,159
Please don't cry.

313
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
Honey.

314
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,640
What's going on?

315
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,399
Jia Haowen.

316
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:08,919
I...

317
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,799
Why are you crying?

318
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,760
Hello.

319
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,880
Shanshan?

320
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,039
Please come in.

321
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,039
Please.

322
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,640
Mr. Jia asked me to come here.

323
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,600
You finally arrived.

324
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,279
Why is the baby crying?

325
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:25,919
I'll take a look.

326
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,279
Okay.

327
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,039
Shanshan?

328
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,079
Shanshan.

329
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,760
Hello, Auntie.

330
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,880
You finally arrived.

331
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,120
Here.

332
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,520
Let me take the baby.

333
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,799
Check it out.

334
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,039
What's wrong with the baby?

335
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,399
Just cannot stop crying.

336
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,079
Why?

337
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:36,840
Baby.

338
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,120
Jia Haowen.

339
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,919
You're something.

340
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
Mom! Mom!

341
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,120
Mom! We're back!

342
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,880
Coming!

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,960
Coming!

344
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,399
Be careful, be careful.

345
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,319
Babies.

346
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:52,399
Mommy!

347
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,319
You're back so soon.

348
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,600
What's the matter?

349
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,919
You're sending them back already?

350
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,960
Why not spend more time with them?

351
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,640
I want my doll!

352
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,120
Well...

353
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,559
Here. Take them.

354
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,520
Well...

355
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,360
They wanted to eat with me,

356
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,720
but also wanted to see you early.

357
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,279
So I thought,

358
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,679
why not just pack it up?

359
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,559
Let's eat together.

360
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,240
Right?

361
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,199
That's better.

362
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:10,960
Honestly,

363
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,360
the girls are very considerate.

364
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,000
It's because of your good upbringing.

365
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,559
I know you don't like pizza,

366
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,960
so I bought seafood porridge for you.

367
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,240
Do we have bowls at home?

368
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,279
Stop!

369
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,399
Change your shoes.

370
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:37,000
Mommy!

371
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:37,919
See?

372
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,679
The doll you promised me.

373
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,120
Daddy bought it for me.

374
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,799
Yes!

375
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,760
Alright, you can play in your room.

376
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
I'll talk to dad for a moment.

377
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,399
Okay.

378
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,039
Okay.

379
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,319
Don't rush.

380
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,120
What's wrong?

381
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,120
Yu Hai.

382
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,880
Don't buy things for the kids

383
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,279
randomly in the future.

384
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,679
I originally wanted to

385
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,600
buy the dolls

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,559
as rewards for them.

387
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,279
But with you doing this,

388
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,439
it makes it hard for me to educate them.

389
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
Children at this age

390
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,799
are especially good at taking advantage

391
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,880
of conflicts between their parents

392
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,079
to achieve their little goals.

393
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,279
Is that so?

394
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,079
Children these days

395
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,799
are so scheming.

396
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,480
To prevent them

397
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,439
from taking advantage

398
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:19,480
of it again,

399
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,000
let's resolve our conflicts.

400
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,799
How does that sound?

401
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,319
Resolving the issue is simple.

402
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,279
Next weekend,

403
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,079
you don't need to come over.

404
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:28,679
Well...

405
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,600
No, no, okay.

406
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:30,919
Then I won't buy them

407
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,840
anything in the future.

408
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,240
Alright?

409
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,919
We need to resolve our conflict.

410
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,640
We should resolve it, right?

411
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,199
You can't just

412
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,120
simplistically and arbitrarily

413
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,679
resolve the person causing the conflict.

414
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,960
Right?

415
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:56,399
Check it out, right here.

416
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,840
See? They've even got bowls in here.

417
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,720
The bowls at home are clean.

418
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,600
That's right.

419
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,919
Give it a try. See if it's good.

420
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,279
Smells pretty fresh.

421
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,720
Their food

422
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,600
is always amazing!

423
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,600
I knew you'd like it.

424
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,559
If you like it, go ahead and eat.

425
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,319
It's not that. I'm just worried that

426
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,559
if you enjoy it too much,

427
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,679
this serving might not be enough.

428
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,640
There's another serving here

429
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:19,360
for you.

430
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
Can you stop talking so much?

431
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,039
It's really affecting my appetite.

432
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,960
Wanwan, Zhenzhen,

433
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,439
come out and eat some pizza!

434
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,240
Mom,

435
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
I want to play a little longer.

436
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,799
Wanwan, come here.

437
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm coming!

438
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,559
Mom.

439
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,720
The doctor brought you

440
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,799
more goodies!

441
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:47,960
Here.

442
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,439
Take the pizza inside

443
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,480
and eat with Zhenzhen.

444
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,960
Okay.

445
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,679
Don't get it on your clothes.

446
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:52,960
Got it.

447
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,679
See you later, Mom.

448
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,319
What's this broccoli?

449
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,600
Look, are these raw or cooked?

450
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,439
Unbelievable!

451
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,600
The cutting board

452
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,159
isn't even clean.

453
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,520
You may get a stomach ache.

454
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,159
Let me throw it out.

455
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,399
Do we have a plunger?

456
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,640
I told you the broccoli isn't good.

457
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,000
Even the toilet won't eat it.

458
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,039
Yu Hai.

459
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,919
Are you here to deliver food

460
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,120
or to cause trouble?

461
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,199
What?

462
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,840
Are you crazy?

463
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,480
Who told you

464
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
to give the office to her?

465
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,319
Calm down, calm down.

466
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:42,640
Unbelievable!

467
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,559
Outsourcing team?

468
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,679
That's just an excuse!

469
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,520
She's only been at Xinmiao for a few days

470
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,720
and already thinks she's all that,

471
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,279
right?

472
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,319
Let her come and see me!

473
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:52,039
Listen,

474
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,439
Nobody can move into your office!

475
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,679
How could you let her get away with this?

476
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,480
Hey.

477
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,600
Mr. Zhang always said

478
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,120
I should share the office

479
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,439
with her.

480
00:16:58,439 --> 00:16:59,840
What could I do, not let her?

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,760
No way!

482
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,679
She can't move in!

483
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,559
Who is she!

484
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,640
I'll get it covered!

485
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,399
Let me talk to her!

486
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,079
No!

487
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,679
Don't go!

488
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,679
Listen to me.

489
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,960
If you go now,

490
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,679
it will be seen as obstructing

491
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,799
Director Huang's project,

492
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,399
and Xinmiao's content upgrade.

493
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,600
We can't take the blame for this.

494
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,559
Besides,

495
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,399
look at me.

496
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm in no shape to do anything.

497
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I've thought it through.

498
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,079
What I need to do now

499
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,439
is to support my subordinates

500
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,840
to the best of my ability.

501
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,079
It's just an office.

502
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
It's not like it's home.

503
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,880
Let her have it.

504
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,840
As long as it's good for the company.

505
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,319
But...

506
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,199
It's just...

507
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,960
Meichuan.

508
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,279
Director Xu.

509
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,240
I heard you're moving.

510
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,720
How about

511
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,079
I help you pack?

512
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,079
Pack my foot!

513
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,039
Hey, hey! Meichuan.

514
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:49,640
She...

515
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,760
She just broke up

516
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,880
with her boyfriend.

517
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,399
She's in a bad mood

518
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:53,439
and is taking it out on me.

519
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,199
Alright, if you need help,

520
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:56,840
just let me know.

521
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,840
Thank you.

522
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,640
Thank you.

523
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,240
I haven't even had a boyfriend yet.

524
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,199
Don't curse me like that.

525
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,159
Don't be like this.

526
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,600
It was a slip of the tongue, sorry.

527
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,919
Calm down.

528
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:10,760
I can't.

529
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,120
I need to talk to Mr. Zhang.

530
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,679
This kind of bullying isn't right.

531
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,159
There's some good news.

532
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,079
Do you want to hear it?

533
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,159
What is it?

534
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,880
You're moving into his office,

535
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,199
and he's promoting you to vice president?

536
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,880
How is that possible?

537
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,039
Come.

538
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:24,799
Sit down.

539
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,480
If he asks me to go to his office,

540
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,640
I can't go either.

541
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,439
Why can't you go?

542
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,159
You should be sitting across from him.

543
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:34,880
Pester him to death.

544
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,960
If I sit across from him every day,

545
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,199
how will I slack off?

546
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,399
This isn't good for the pregnancy.

547
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,360
I told him

548
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,079
I want to move to your office.

549
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,159
We'll be in the same room.

550
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:46,960
He agreed.

551
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,000
What!

552
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,439
Hey!

553
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,200
You...

554
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,279
It doesn't do me any good!

555
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,200
What...

556
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,279
If you go to my office,

557
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,920
the sunlight there is poor.

558
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,319
My place is cluttered with stuff.

559
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:03,599
And...

560
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,359
It's small.

561
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,559
People come and go...

562
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,799
Going there isn't good

563
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,520
for your pregnancy either.

564
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
How about setting up

565
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,799
a workstation by the window?

566
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,160
You...

567
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,279
You're so pathetic.

568
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,720
Don't throw kitchen trash

569
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,000
in the toilet ever.

570
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,599
Thank you.

571
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,000
So comfortable.

572
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:39,520
Dad.

573
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:40,960
Where else are you feeling pain?

574
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,480
My neck hurts.

575
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,039
Anywhere else?

576
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,400
I...

577
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,160
I...

578
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,879
I...

579
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,079
My whole body's hurt.

580
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,520
Let me help you.

581
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:56,799
Wanwan, Zhenzhen,

582
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,160
you gotta go to school tomorrow.

583
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,319
Go check

584
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,359
your homework,

585
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,760
and pack your school bags.

586
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,200
But dad is hurting all over.

587
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,480
I'll take care of him.

588
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,720
Alright.

589
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,240
Go.

590
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,279
Thanks to both of you for the massage.

591
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,720
Yeah.

592
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,559
You've done a great job.

593
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,879
It was nothing.

594
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,079
Look,

595
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,760
this is probably

596
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,480
due to sitting at a desk

597
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,440
for too long.

598
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,599
So,

599
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,559
my neck and back

600
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
are really stiff and hurt.

601
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,319
That's why I bumped into the door earlier.

602
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,599
Just use a pain patch.

603
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,639
I'll have some delivered.

604
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,839
Can you help me apply it?

605
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,520
My arms are

606
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,319
too short to reach.

607
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,160
Right, just put it on from the top.

608
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,240
A bit lower.

609
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,960
Right there.

610
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,480
That's good.

611
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,760
Perfect.

612
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,160
In the future,

613
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,760
don't let any outsiders

614
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,200
like property staff, security guards,

615
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,520
or food delivery people

616
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,760
into our home.

617
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,160
Just three of you in this house.

618
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,319
I would be worried.

619
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,960
Why?

620
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,639
Thank you.

621
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,319
You are all smiles!

622
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,119
A professional nanny

623
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,520
really makes a difference.

624
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,799
Look, Shanshan knew immediately

625
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,520
that the baby's crying

626
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,639
was because

627
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:45,680
of the bottom sore.

628
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,119
It was because you and Yingzi

629
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:47,760
didn't clean her properly.

630
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,680
You made her bottom sore

631
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,359
and she cried all afternoon.

632
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,359
And you thought my milk wasn't enough

633
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,440
and she was hungry.

634
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,839
I didn't realize

635
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,279
babies' bottoms

636
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,440
could be so sensitive these days.

637
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:57,839
Alright, alright.

638
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,119
No need to make a fuss.

639
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,279
Shanshan is doing great.

640
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,440
She helps a lot.

641
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,480
It's nice to have a professional

642
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,319
take care of things.

643
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,319
I'm going to get some nursing oil.

644
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,160
Sure.

645
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:07,680
Honey,

646
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,240
I really handled this well, didn't I?

647
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,400
Cost a lot?

648
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:14,160
Whatever the cost,

649
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,639
it's worth it.

650
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,039
Professionals should

651
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,160
handle these things.

652
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,760
Don't worry about the cost.

653
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,279
I can cover it.

654
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,480
Don't be so tight-fisted.

655
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,480
Honey.

656
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,720
Let's have some oil.

657
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,160
Here, let me help.

658
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,839
Thanks.

659
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,480
No worries.

660
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,400
Is that enough?

661
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Enough.

662
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,559
See?

663
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,240
She's smiling.

664
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,639
You are so professional.

665
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,160
Shanshan.

666
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,879
Teach me someday.

667
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:42,960
I want to help as well.

668
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,079
Sure thing.

669
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,119
Why, mom?

670
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,160
You want to do this?

671
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,760
With your rough hands,

672
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,200
I don't think so.

673
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,639
Fine.

674
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,400
So rude.

675
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,839
Feel good?

676
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,319
See, she's enjoying it.

677
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,200
See?

678
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,839
Impressive.

679
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,799
Don't touch her!

680
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,240
Why? I'm her dad!

681
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,319
Babe...

682
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,039
Give me more of this.

683
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:03,359
Okay.

684
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,079
A bit more.

685
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,440
More.

686
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,160
Raising kids these days

687
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,279
is so much more scientific.

688
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,799
There's real progress.

689
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,879
When I was young,

690
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,079
you didn't have any of this.

691
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,920
Now you complain.

692
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,200
Look how much she enjoys it.

693
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Really, she's so comfortable.

694
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,599
I heard from Grandma

695
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,359
that you've been drinking chicken soup

696
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,359
with mom lately.

697
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,079
Yes.

698
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
Every day, it's just plain boiled chicken.

699
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,879
Am I postpartum?

700
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,119
I don't like it neither.

701
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,639
My aunt has been making it for my mom.

702
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:56,319
Jesus...

703
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,760
I can't even swallow it.

704
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,400
Let's go out for a nice meal today.

705
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,639
What do you want to eat? It's on me.

706
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm ok with anything.

707
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,279
I love everything you like.

708
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,799
Great, let's have a feast today.

709
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,359
Hey, can I borrow some money?

710
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,920
I want to buy this card set.

711
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:12,960
This?

712
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,559
I'll buy it for you.

713
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,760
Really?

714
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,200
Thank you!

715
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:21,599
You are welcome.

716
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,319
Our middle school students' allowance

717
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,240
is definitely more generous

718
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,079
than yours.

719
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
I hope I'll have that much

720
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,000
when I'm in middle school.

721
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,200
You definitely will.

722
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,760
You'll probably have more than me.

723
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,839
Hey, do you think my younger sister

724
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,079
will have more than I do in the future?

725
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,879
No way. You're the eldest.

726
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,359
You'll have to

727
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,200
take care of your little sister

728
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,799
just like I do.

729
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,680
Got it?

730
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,879
I'm your role model.

731
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,000
Why don't we team up now?

732
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,440
I'll learn from you.

733
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,760
You can share my snacks.

734
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,160
You can learn from me.

735
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:53,760
But your snack? It's a no-go.

736
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,480
Kids shouldn't eat too many snacks.

737
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,200
That's what the "health expert" says.

738
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,240
My aunt, I mean.

739
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,000
Being a kid is so tough.

740
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,279
I wish I could grow up like you tomorrow.

741
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,119
Oh, Zhenzhen,

742
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,839
let's use our dolls

743
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,400
to play house!

744
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,240
How?

745
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,160
Let's do this.

746
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:14,920
Sis,

747
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,119
look, I'm the queen.

748
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:17,879
Better than you,

749
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,440
you are just a small princess.

750
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm a princess.

751
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,680
I'll be the queen one day.

752
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,520
Time's up.

753
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,279
Then I won't allow that to happen.

754
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,400
I'm your daughter.

755
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,240
Yu Hai.

756
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:34,599
I'm talking to you.

757
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,400
Can't you hear?

758
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,240
Your ears aren't working,

759
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,920
huh?

760
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,000
You step on me? I would step on you.

761
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,680
It's getting late.

762
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,799
They need to take a bath.

763
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,160
Fine.

764
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
That

765
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,559
is definitely made up of mirrors.

766
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,000
That

767
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,520
must be really hard.

768
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,440
Well, dad's leaving.

769
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,319
Hey!

770
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,720
Dad's clothes are here.

771
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,520
It's like dad's still here.

772
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,319
Okay?

773
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,359
Fine.

774
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,639
Look, dad's on the balcony.

775
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,359
And

776
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,839
I'm standing there.

777
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:00,200
Well,

778
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,879
that means your guardian

779
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:03,599
is here with you all day.

780
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,480
Just play and sleep freely.

781
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,319
Alright?

782
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:05,720
Yeah.

783
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,160
Yeah.

784
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,559
Just take dad's clothes

785
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,799
as a scarecrow.

786
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,160
You are always with us.

787
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:10,799
Yeah.

788
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,279
Exactly.

789
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,319
I'm leaving.

790
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,680
I'm going.

791
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,440
Just go.

792
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,760
How can I live without you?

793
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,400
I'm leaving.

794
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,319
Enough.

795
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:22,960
Just go.

796
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,879
Goodbye, Wanwan.

797
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:24,559
Goodbye, Zhenzhen.

798
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,839
Goodbye, Wanzhen.

799
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,639
The lunchbox delivery guy...

800
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
He won't be as charming as me.

801
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,440
Goodbye, girls.

802
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,240
Enough.

803
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,559
What are you two doing?

804
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,520
Haven't act enough?

805
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,879
Who taught you this?

806
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,839
Go clean up. Take a shower.

807
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:51,960
Okay.

808
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,079
Hey.

809
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,039
I'm home.

810
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:12,799
Where's Yunjie?

811
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,839
She went to play with Xiongxiong

812
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:18,039
Meng'an is pregnant now.

813
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,319
You need to keep a close eye

814
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,799
on Yunjie's studies.

815
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,279
Don't let her play around all the time.

816
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:22,879
Got it, got it.

817
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:24,000
I've been keeping an eye on it.

818
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,599
Wait.

819
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,000
Come here.

820
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,279
Take a look.

821
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,520
You've got it ready!

822
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:33,680
Yes!

823
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,839
Look, I've also made a booklet.

824
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,680
You can use this

825
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,200
for the hospital check-ups.

826
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,520
You are really something.

827
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,920
Meticulous

828
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,839
and careful.

829
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,279
Alright.

830
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:47,720
I'll go do it tomorrow

831
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,119
Tomorrow?

832
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,520
Sure.

833
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,760
There are many people

834
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,599
waiting to do this.

835
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,879
Fortunately, I went to the community today

836
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:58,200
and got all the paperwork done.

837
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
That's right.

838
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,440
Let me tell you.

839
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,879
Look.

840
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,559
This receipt

841
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,559
is from Meng'an's first blood test

842
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,480
when she found out she was pregnant.

843
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,160
You need to keep this safe.

844
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:08,879
Sure.

845
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,720
And this.

846
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,639
This is from the community.

847
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,200
Child health care manual.

848
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:13,680
Okay.

849
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,799
Take these.

850
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
You gotta

851
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,760
bring them to the check-up.

852
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
If you don't have time,

853
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,000
I can go with her.

854
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,480
No.

855
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,039
I need to do this.

856
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,639
Sis.

857
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,639
Alright.

858
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,839
You go, I won't argue with you.

859
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,920
Lin, I want Meng'an

860
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,960
to go to the hospital

861
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,119
that Mengxin

862
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,160
to give birth at.

863
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,039
I think that hospital

864
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,359
has good conditions.

865
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,279
Yeah.

866
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,879
But it's a little bit expensive.

867
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,279
I'll have it covered.

868
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,039
It's not about money.

869
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,879
Meng'an is an older mother-to-be.

870
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,720
If anything goes wrong...

871
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,319
..it's better to be in a public hospital.

872
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,279
I'd feel more secure.

873
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:53,119
Right?

874
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,799
You are right.

875
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,200
But...

876
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
Looking at these documents,

877
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,559
I don't think there's anything

878
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,240
to worry about.

879
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,480
She's having a second baby.

880
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,760
There shouldn't be any issues.

881
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,359
Yes.

882
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,480
I'm not worried.

883
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,520
Usually, everything's fine.

884
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
Definitely nothing to worry about!

885
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,960
Yeah, definitely nothing!

886
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:14,520
Now you are talking.

887
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,400
What's wrong?

888
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,400
If mom and dad were still here...

889
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,720
..they'd be so happy to hear

890
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,559
you're having another baby.

891
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,680
Why are you crying?

892
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Look at you.

893
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,119
You're moved.

894
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,240
Feeling emotional.

895
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,559
I'm just so happy.

896
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:43,440
I know, I know.

897
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,520
Alright then.

898
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,400
I'm cooking.

899
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,079
Okay.

900
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:47,960
Right.

901
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,240
Thank you.

902
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,119
I'm so happy.

903
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,760
This is a limited edition card!

904
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
I'm so lucky!

905
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:25,200
Mine is a special edition too.

906
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,520
We hit the jackpot.

907
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,520
Cheers!

908
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,639
Sis, you're so good to me.

909
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,839
I'm not used to it.

910
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,359
Haven't I always been good to you?

911
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,279
Well, you...

912
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,799
...always used to play with my mom.

913
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,319
Is it because my mom

914
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,639
has no time to be with you?

915
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,079
No, not at all.

916
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,319
I just thought you were feeling down.

917
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,720
Since Auntie hasn't been home

918
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,400
for two months,

919
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,319
I figured you missed her.

920
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,639
Sis, if you take me out for BBQ,

921
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,319
I wouldn't miss my mom so much.

922
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,279
Look at you!

923
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,680
Alright, we're having Korean BBQ tonight.

924
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,319
Cheese platters.

925
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:56,839
Let's go!

926
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,000
Having a sister is the best.

927
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,079
It really is.

928
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,240
I'm so happy

929
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,000
for the baby

930
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,879
in my mom's belly

931
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,520
to have a great sister like me.

932
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,599
You won't stop liking me just because

933
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,920
you have a younger brother, right?

934
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,720
Of course not.

935
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,359
You're still my brother.

936
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,520
And besides,

937
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,359
who knows,

938
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,279
the baby in my mom's tummy

939
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:14,920
might be a sister.

940
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,200
I like sisters anyway.

941
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,480
Me too.

942
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,319
I'm the big brother to my younger sister.

943
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,039
When she grows up,

944
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,760
I'll play with her, like you do with me.

945
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,039
Then I'll be

946
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,079
the biggest sister

947
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,960
leading three kids! Cool!

948
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,520
I've got

949
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,839
two younger ones too.

950
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,400
Auntie's baby

951
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,480
gotta call me big bro.

952
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,799
Have you finished your homework?

953
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,639
No eating until it's done!

954
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,920
I'm doing it right now.

955
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:40,920
That's right.

956
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,160
Hold your head up higher.

957
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
That won't be good for your neck.

958
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,119
Honey.

959
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,520
Don't brush your teeth before bed.

960
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,240
Drink the milk first.

961
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,279
No.

962
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,799
You make me drink milk and soup all day.

963
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,480
I'm gonna throw up.

964
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:23,960
Honey, honey, honey.

965
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,079
Just take a sip. Just a sip.

966
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,839
A sip. A sip.

967
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,119
It helps you relax and sleep well.

968
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,000
Please. Please.

969
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:31,720
Finish it.

970
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,240
Come on.

971
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:36,839
Honey,

972
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:38,279
I'm going back to work

973
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,960
tomorrow.

974
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,799
What about the baby?

975
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,839
Aren't you taking care of her?

976
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,920
I'll handle everything alone?

977
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,039
Honey, isn't Shanshan around?

978
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,960
She's a professional.

979
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,760
She's here for professional support.

980
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,639
I'm here for emotional support.

981
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:52,520
Honey,

982
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,680
don't touch me. I'm so frustrated.

983
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,039
Why should I stay home with the baby

984
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,760
while you get to work

985
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,039
and relax?

986
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:00,960
Honey,

987
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,520
I don't get to relax either.

988
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:04,520
See, I'm here with you

989
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,200
for over 50 days

990
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,520
since you have given birth to the baby.

991
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,520
Workers at my company

992
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,119
are all complaining

993
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,799
about me.

994
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,839
Like, what's going on with Jia?

995
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,879
Honey,

996
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:11,639
see,

997
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm also working to support our family,

998
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,039
I mean, to create wealth.

999
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,520
What do you mean?

1000
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,639
You create wealth outside,

1001
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,559
and I stay home doing nothing?

1002
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,520
Honey,

1003
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,400
you are the greatest asset we have.

1004
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:25,799
You're my everything.

1005
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,599
I don't believe that.

1006
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,799
Honey,

1007
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,440
just have one more sip.

1008
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,680
Madam. Where should I put this bed?

1009
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,319
Just put it there for now.

1010
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,359
Why are you setting up a bed?

1011
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,520
Aren't you trying to create wealth?

1012
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,599
Then you go ahead and create it.

1013
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,039
Shanshan and I will sleep here.

1014
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,319
I still need to feed the baby at night.

1015
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,920
Where should I sleep then?

1016
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Sleep wherever you want.

1017
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,599
I understand.

1018
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,920
My wife loves me so much,

1019
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,119
she's worried about me

1020
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,400
that I might not sleep well.

1021
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,760
She wants me to sleep alone, right?

1022
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,559
But dear, let me tell you,

1023
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,039
I'd still prefer to sleep

1024
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,319
with you and baby.

1025
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,680
It's so much more intimate.

1026
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,200
Isn't that right, dear?

1027
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,839
Sorry.

1028
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,400
I don't want to be close to you.

1029
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,079
Go.

1030
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,920
Honey.

1031
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,440
Just go.

1032
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:17,680
Dear.

1033
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,319
Go out.

1034
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:19,279
Honey, the milk.

1035
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:20,160
You have it.

1036
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,240
You need to create wealth,

1037
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,319
so you need to sleep well.

1038
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:22,639
Dear.

1039
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,279
Thank you.

1040
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:23,599
Honey.

1041
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,559
Dear.

1042
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:26,839
Madam?

1043
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,799
What happened?

1044
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,799
Nothing.

1045
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,119
Just set up the bed.

1046
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:30,720
Okay.

1047
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,599
Son,

1048
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,599
why aren't you sleeping at this late hour?

1049
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,720
What are you doing?

1050
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,039
Mom, you scared me.

1051
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,079
Why aren't you sleeping at this late hour?

1052
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:09,720
What's going on?

1053
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,119
Did Xinxin kick you out?

1054
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,160
Mom, what are you talking about?

1055
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,879
Isn't it because your daughter-in-law

1056
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,119
is worried about your son?

1057
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,799
She doesn't want me to take care of

1058
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,639
the baby, and I also have work to do.

1059
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,279
Is that true?

1060
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:26,200
Mom, don't interfere in our matters.

1061
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,920
It's between us.

1062
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,839
I won't interfere, I won't interfere.

1063
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,279
Mom.

1064
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,960
I'll go to my mother-in-law's place

1065
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,920
tomorrow to bring Xiongxiong here.

1066
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,799
You take care of the eldest grandchild.

1067
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,200
Don't trouble her.

1068
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,680
Got it, got it.

1069
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,680
Where are you going, mom?

1070
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,879
Xiongxiong's pants are torn.

1071
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,599
I'm going to sew them up.

1072
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,000
Where did you get the needle and thread?

1073
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,520
Acting so virtuous...

1074
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,839
Go to bed.

1075
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,960
Go to your room.

1076
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:53,960
Fine.

1077
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,679
Be careful going down the stairs.

1078
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,440
Alright.

1079
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,639
You should rest early too.

1080
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,639
Got it, got it.

1081
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,520
Don't fall.

1082
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:58,960
Okay.

1083
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,159
Be careful, hold on tight.

1084
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:00,960
Got it.

1085
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,400
You drop me off

1086
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,520
at the hospital later.

1087
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,559
Then you can go to work.

1088
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,280
I took the day off.

1089
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,480
I've been with you for every check-up.

1090
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,719
Not today.

1091
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,920
Today's

1092
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,400
check-up might take a bit longer.

1093
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,039
There might be a lot of tests.

1094
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,360
Just do your work.

1095
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,079
Why is it going to take a while?

1096
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,000
You're not hiding anything from me,

1097
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,679
are you?

1098
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,559
No.

1099
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,840
You better be honest with me.

1100
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
Well...

1101
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,639
Just...

1102
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,520
I got a message from the hospital,

1103
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,840
saying my Down syndrome screening is abnormal.

1104
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,119
I need to have surgery today.

1105
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,679
When did you find out?

1106
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:44,759
Yesterday.

1107
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,559
Why didn't you tell me?

1108
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,559
You didn't tell me about something so big.

1109
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:49,480
Can you handle this

1110
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,360
all by yourself?

1111
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,360
What if something goes wrong?

1112
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,280
You should have told me.

1113
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,840
It's a surgery!

1114
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,159
It's a big deal!

1115
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,000
Unbelievable!

1116
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,119
I'm just scared.

1117
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,199
Well, if you're scared,

1118
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,440
you should tell me.

1119
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,559
What do you think of me?

1120
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,159
No worries.

1121
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,119
I'll be here with you.

1122
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,719
It'll be okay.

1123
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,520
Haowen.

1124
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,079
Haowen.

1125
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,000
Jia Haowen!

1126
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,559
Honey!

1127
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,440
You are awake?

1128
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,920
Why are you sleeping here?

1129
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,000
I was working.

1130
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,920
I must have dozed off.

1131
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,239
Are you trying to play the martyr?

1132
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,960
Can't you sleep in Xiongxiong's room?

1133
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,719
I was up three times last night

1134
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,679
feeding the baby.

1135
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,320
You, on the other hand,

1136
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,599
slept through the night.

1137
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,559
I can't even wake you up.

1138
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,520
Being a man is so easy.

1139
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,280
Honey.

1140
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,639
I know you're hungry.

1141
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:23,960
I'll get you something to eat.

1142
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,000
Why didn't you do it earlier?

1143
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,960
You're getting it now?

1144
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,599
I'll be starving to death when you home.

1145
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,280
Yingzi.,

1146
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,000
is there any food?

1147
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,599
I'm starving.

1148
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,679
Yingzi, hurry up with the food.

1149
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,559
I just talked

1150
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,039
with the doctor.

1151
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,440
The doctor said

1152
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,360
there are many possible reasons

1153
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
that lead to abnormal results.

1154
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,239
The surgery is

1155
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,880
to further check

1156
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,880
if it's related to chromosomes.

1157
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,719
And since you are an older pregnant woman,

1158
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,559
it's quite common.

1159
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Really?

1160
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,119
Why would I lie?

1161
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,159
Aren't you nervous?

1162
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,840
Of course, I'm nervous.

1163
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,400
I am worried about you.

1164
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,199
I don't know if there's anything else

1165
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:53,960
that you haven't told me.

1166
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,199
I'm sorry, okay?

1167
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,280
Just stay calm.

1168
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:05,480
Relax, don't be nervous.

1169
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,320
If you're nervous,

1170
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,159
the check-up might not go well.

1171
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:08,840
So, relax.

1172
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,199
Don't worry.

1173
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,960
Mrs. Xu Meng'an. Time for the surgery.

1174
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:24,280
Go on.

1175
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,639
I'll wait here for you.

1176
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:26,800
Stay calm.

1177
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,719
You're letting me go alone?

1178
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,159
Come on.

1179
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,119
Our company's project

1180
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,400
is focused on providing shared equipment

1181
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,360
and technical services

1182
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,119
for small startups.

1183
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,119
Next month, on the first,

1184
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,599
we'll have

1185
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,119
a small launch event

1186
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,400
at our studio.

1187
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,679
If you're free,

1188
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,719
come by, chat,

1189
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,360
and have some tea.

1190
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,840
Maybe

1191
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,239
we'll spark

1192
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,360
some new ideas.

1193
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,520
This club

1194
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,280
was set up

1195
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,119
by a few investors in the circle.

1196
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,520
Though it's called a club,

1197
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,320
it's really more of

1198
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,039
a matchmaking service for investors.

1199
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,079
It hosts small venture capital meetings

1200
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,400
to help projects

1201
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,119
find potential investors

1202
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,079
and stuff.

1203
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,679
I find the communication here

1204
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,920
is much more efficient, compared to

1205
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,759
large venture capital events.

1206
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:12,520
Plus,

1207
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,199
the projects are all carefully selected.

1208
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,599
Many of the business models

1209
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,599
are quite innovative

1210
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,079
and very promising.

1211
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,199
Wendy,

1212
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,039
are you interested in any of these?

1213
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:23,840
Yes.

1214
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,559
I've noted them down. Take a look.

1215
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,239
I think these

1216
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,079
align well

1217
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,800
with our company's

1218
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,840
investment direction.

1219
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,960
We can proceed

1220
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,119
with further research and contact.

1221
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:35,840
Looks like

1222
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,559
we're on the same page!

1223
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,880
I also think these options are good.

1224
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,320
You have a knack for thinking like a boss.

1225
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,239
You're too kind.

1226
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,559
There are more meetings this afternoon,

1227
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,119
but they might run quite late.

1228
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,960
I'm not sure how long you can stay.

1229
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
You're the boss.

1230
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,400
It's up to you.

1231
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:49,880
Well, I'll have to take you out more often

1232
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,719
to broaden your horizons.

1233
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,400
It's free of charge.

1234
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,599
These are opportunities

1235
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,719
that money can't buy.

1236
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,800
That's right.

1237
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:56,199
In our field,

1238
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,079
once you're in,

1239
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,520
having the skills is essential,

1240
00:42:58,679 --> 00:42:59,639
but ultimately,

1241
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,800
it's about vision and perspective.

1242
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,079
So,

1243
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,320
if I want to become

1244
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,360
a good investor,

1245
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,119
what do you think my shortcoming is?

1246
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,679
Your shortcoming is

1247
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:10,920
you have

1248
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:13,960
no shortcomings.
