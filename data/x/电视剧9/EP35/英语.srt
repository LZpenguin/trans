00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:48,520
Just in Time EP35

3
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,558
It seems that you

4
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:52,040
really want to remarry her.

5
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,160
Then later

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,559
I won't help you

7
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,559
like last time.

8
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,439
I will persuade Wanzhen

9
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,520
to not remarry you.

10
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,479
Why?

11
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:59,320
Simple.

12
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,320
Because that

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,639
it prevents her from working for me.

14
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,240
I don't care about your marriage.

15
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,240
I only consider the problem

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,199
from the perspective of investment

17
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,320
Look,

18
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,479
over the past eight years

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,400
in your marriage

20
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,680
Wanzhen was

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,040
a full-time housewife.

22
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:15,919
So that you can

23
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,680
started a business without hitch.

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,520
You want to make your business big.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,599
You need financing.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,999
It'll inevitably add more pressure.

27
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,240
You will be busier.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,800
If you reunite

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,480
with your family and children,

30
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,920
or have more children,

31
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,839
you will need someone

32
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:31,839
to take care of the family for you.

33
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,559
Isn't it?

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,640
But please rest assured,

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,999
even if we get remarried,

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,960
I will

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,559
fully support her work all the same.

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,080
Can you

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
support Wanzhen be like this

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
so that she can work at full stretch?

41
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,879
Or you are ready

42
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,640
prepared to sacrifice

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
your own work for your family?

44
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,719
As an investor,

45
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,520
I have to

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,120
re-evaluate your company.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,439
Mr. Yu,

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,719
are you willing to give up

49
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,920
your own career,

50
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,839
and your own business?

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,839
Don't worry. I will never do that.

52
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,719
Then why do you

53
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,960
ask Wanzhen to return to the marriage?

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,200
Do you think that remarriage is as simple

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,719
as applying for another certificate?

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,999
If I were Wanzhen,

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,960
I won't agree with

58
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,200
such a bad deal.

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,279
Mr. Yu contributed a lot.

60
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,039
Just look at him in recent years.

61
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,759
He spared no efforts

62
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,200
to raise finance for Blue Ocean,

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,839
I knew

64
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,240
what kind of person he is.

65
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,319
Wanzhen,

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,719
aren't you even a little bit touched

67
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,439
by what he did for you

68
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,960
during this period?

69
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,039
Now the tables are turning.

70
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,800
In the past, I lived in a villa.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,120
I cooked every day.

72
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,959
He is like a guest.

73
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,199
Taking our home a hotel, an inn.

74
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,959
Today, I have become the guest.

75
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,280
I eat and drink, and then go away.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Then you

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,079
just enjoy this moment.

78
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,280
Why did you call me here to cover for you?

79
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,559
And asked me to make up so many lies?

80
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,079
A meeting with investment banker.

81
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,280
A friend, or things like that.

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,959
Then, what about you?

83
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
If it weren't for that "surprise"

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,160
during our last business trip.

85
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,439
which inspired him,

86
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,840
could this happen?

87
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,999
You should be responsible.

88
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,639
I knew it would go like this.

89
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,040
So, I helped you with it.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
With what?

91
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,920
I helped you extinguish

92
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,999
the small tongue of

93
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:57,879
flame of remarrying you

94
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,840
burning in Yu Hai's heart.

95
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,559
What did you tell him?

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
I told him, if he wanted to remarry you,

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,959
I wouldn't invest in Blue Ocean.

98
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
He chose Blue Ocean.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
For sure?

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
Generally, it's like this.

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,360
But we didn't talk

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,639
that straightforward.

103
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,040
I'm not a tyrant.

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
I think Yu Hai didn't think it through.

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,920
Like why you divorced him.

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,160
He didn't figure it out yet.

107
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,319
In his marriage,

108
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,160
as a father,

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
and a husband,

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,079
what he should contribute,

111
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,439
what he should be responsible.

112
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,319
If these are not considered thoroughly.

113
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600
how could he get remarried?

114
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,360
What, are you hungry?

115
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,480
Are you hungry?

116
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,360
It smells so good.

117
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,319
Much better than that steak.

118
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,800
If it was not for Yu Hai's feelings,

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
I would not say it was delicious.

120
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,040
Tasty.

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,680
You know why

122
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,600
I came as soon as

123
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,439
you called me today?

124
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,639
Why?

125
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,399
I worried that

126
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,879
you agreed to remarry him

127
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
driven by a momentary impulse.

128
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,040
That's overthinking.

129
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,879
Totally unnecessary.

130
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:12,519
Eight years ago,

131
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,319
you quit for your family.

132
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,959
You are used to sacrifice for love.

133
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,079
Moreover,

134
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
women of your age

135
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
are not easy to find a partner

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,399
in terms of the big data.

137
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,439
If you choose someone

138
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,519
younger than you,

139
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,399
a few years later,

140
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,040
he will still be young when you are aged.

141
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,240
If you choose someone older than you,

142
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,759
a few years later,

143
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,480
you have to be his baby-sitter.

144
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,639
So, getting back with

145
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,600
with your elite ex-husband

146
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,280
is a good choice

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
What's wrong with my age?

148
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,399
I am at a golden age.

149
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,160
How do you know no good partner for me?

150
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,079
I don't bother to find one.

151
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
I don't want to remarry either.

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,879
Me neither.

153
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
I still count on you to make money for me.

154
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,280
I won't let you go so easily.

155
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,639
I knew it!

156
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,319
You never thought for me for real.

157
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,480
It's all for yourself.

158
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,639
Such a miser!

159
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,160
Whatever you say.

160
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
I am a miser.

161
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,999
Single life is enviable.

162
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,399
Free, and at ease.

163
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,199
Come on.

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,079
To single life!

165
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,680
Are you single?

166
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,160
You have so many suitors.

167
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,199
I am enjoying their wooing.

168
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,920
But I will stop for no one.

169
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,120
All right, all right.

170
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,399
Eat your wonton.

171
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,840
Here we go.

172
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
Look, look, look.

173
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,399
Fresh cherries, big and sweet cherries.

174
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,040
Level 5.

175
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,920
As big as a pigeon egg!

176
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,079
Delicious.

177
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,199
Use this in the morning,

178
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,160
and use this at night.

179
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,999
Let's stroll down the street.

180
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:07,800
Shopping from the first store,

181
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,040
to the last store.

182
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,399
As long as you like.

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
I used to treat you like a princess.

184
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,559
From now on, I'll take you as a queen.

185
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,360
As my majesty!

186
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,559
You are the most important in my heart.

187
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,720
You are the only woman in my heart.

188
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Absolutely no another girl here.

189
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,240
You are the only woman in my heart.

190
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,079
You shall believe

191
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,040
in my words and my heart.

192
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,800
Darling.

193
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,079
I'm so lonely

194
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:35,999
when you left me.

195
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:37,199
I was all the time,

196
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,439
I was all the time, thinking about you.

197
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,320
I was thinking about you when driving.

198
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
I was thinking about you when working.

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,720
I was thinking about you even when eating.

200
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,799
Xin, try some rice cake.

201
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,399
Eating sweet will bring you good mood.

202
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,639
Come on, try some.

203
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,200
No, I am full.

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
My darling wants some water.

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,799
Take a sip, just take a sip.

206
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,440
It helps you calm down and sleep well.

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Take a sip, just take a sip.

208
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,679
Drink it all.

209
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
We haven't dated for a long time.

210
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,879
I've made a reservation.

211
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,080
Candlelight dinner.

212
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
Well, not bad for that.

213
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,399
My life dream is

214
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,320
to grow old

215
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,840
with my beloved.

216
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,440
My life dream is to

217
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,080
have babies

218
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,720
with my beloved wife.

219
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,799
Stop teasing me! Hit you!

220
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,279
Dear,

221
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,720
I love you.

222
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,999
Isn't it beautiful?

223
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,639
I love you.

224
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,879
I don't want Mom and Dad to divorce.

225
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,639
If that day really comes,

226
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm telling you, you will

227
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,120
get the house, the car and the deposit.

228
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,720
They are all yours.

229
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,639
I will leave, giving up on everything.

230
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,360
Don't full me.

231
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,240
Everything here will be split in half.

232
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,960
We live our own life.

233
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
After the birth of this baby,

234
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,200
we will get divorced.

235
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,799
I don't want to talk about divorce at all.

236
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,879
I should sincerely apologize to you.

237
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,600
I am sorry.

238
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,960
When I lose my temper,

239
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,279
I often forget about your feelings

240
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,560
I took advantage of your kindness to me,

241
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,960
yet I treated you badly.

242
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,279
I really know I was wrong.

243
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,720
Could you please forgive me, Haowen?

244
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,799
Haowen, Hao...

245
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,279
Life is so short.

246
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,720
I want to live for myself.

247
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I'll be free.

248
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,879
Please set me free.

249
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,519
I'm leaving.

250
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,440
I want you to be around me.

251
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:11,999
I want you to do it.

252
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,360
Let's set each other free, okay?

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,120
I just want to see you.

254
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,240
I don't want you to let me go.

255
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,799
Haowen!

256
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,600
Haowen, Haowen...

257
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
You don't need me anymore?

258
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
and your children?

259
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,600
No, dear.

260
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,480
I don't want this home.

261
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
I'll leave it to you.

262
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm begging you.

263
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,679
Please give me another chance.

264
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,639
I will listen to you.

265
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:25,960
I...

266
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:26,679
Haowen!

267
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,159
Haowen!

268
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,799
Haowen!

269
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,080
Where were you yesterday?

270
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,480
Why didn't you answer my call?

271
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,639
I, I didn't.

272
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,639
You called me?

273
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,120
You still care about me.

274
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,039
Well, isn't it...

275
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,399
That...

276
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,480
The thing in the safe is missing.

277
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,240
Did you take it?

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,080
I took it.

279
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:45,960
For the divorce.

280
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,679
I need to check the inventory of assets.

281
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,840
Wait.

282
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,360
OK.

283
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,879
Then I need to check the inventory too.

284
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,960
So many years of marriage,

285
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,080
half of the family assets

286
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,999
belong to me, too.

287
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,919
What belongs to you?

288
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,120
I've been working to support the family.

289
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
I've discussed it with the lawyer.

290
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,679
The house, the car,

291
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,919
and the family deposit is all yours.

292
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,960
Assets on the company's account is mine.

293
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,080
Why?

294
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,519
For what?

295
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,519
We started the company together!

296
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:20,639
The name of the brand

297
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,399
was named after me.

298
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,639
That's last century's story.

299
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,919
It's totally a new company today.

300
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
It has nothing to do with you at all.

301
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,039
Jia Haowen.

302
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,279
I also hired a lawyer.

303
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,440
Don't think you can dump me casually.

304
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,639
Fine.

305
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,080
Good, that's simple.

306
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,360
I was afraid you didn't understand.

307
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,279
Here is the divorce paper.

308
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,519
If you agree with the terms I propose,

309
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,440
we get divorced within a week.

310
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,480
If you don't,

311
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,120
you will have nothing

312
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
except for the debt of the company.

313
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,440
Asshole!

314
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,720
Jia Haowen, you bastard.

315
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Xin,

316
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,519
how much you paid,

317
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,679
how much you will get.

318
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,399
If you overdrew,

319
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,440
you will pay it back sooner or later.

320
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,600
How to pay back?

321
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,279
How will you pay back the years

322
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,519
me and your children staying with you?

323
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,919
I will pay back what I owe you.

324
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
This is the emergency plan

325
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,039
drafted by our content department

326
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,560
according to the current situation.

327
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,720
We'll immediately

328
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,159
open a new account,

329
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,440
build a new backup platform.

330
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,399
Then everyone,

331
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,919
do you have any comments?

332
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,320
Big comment.

333
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,120
Say it.

334
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,120
In my opinion,

335
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
the company account is monitored,

336
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,279
and the customers are withdrawing.

337
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,200
You only came up

338
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,320
with this solution?

339
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,720
What is this?

340
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,840
Are you kidding me?

341
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,999
Kidding?

342
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,279
Is anyone in the content department

343
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,159
has time for kidding?

344
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
We need to implement rectification,

345
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,399
open a new account,

346
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,279
and build a new platform.

347
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,279
We have tried our best to retrieve.

348
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Ms. Huang,

349
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:42,679
I think you can do nothing

350
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,360
except for pitching edge ball.

351
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,399
Can't you do anything else?

352
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,279
Do you know how to make content?

353
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,519
Do you know what kind of company

354
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,039
Xinmiao is?

355
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:52,879
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou.

356
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,679
If you really want to say something,

357
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,440
say something constructive.

358
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,200
Okay?

359
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,960
What's the use of personal attacks?

360
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,159
Personal attack?

361
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,960
I make personal attacks?

362
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:04,279
Am I from the content department,

363
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,600
or are you?

364
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,560
Ms. Huang,

365
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:07,320
who shall be responsible

366
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,159
for the current situation

367
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,080
of the company today?

368
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,879
Is it mine or yours?

369
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,199
A loss of tens of millions.

370
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,080
Will you or we pay for it?

371
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,439
You examined the injury.

372
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,040
You still choose to sue Meng'an?

373
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:33,199
As a citizen,

374
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,760
I have the right to hold her accountable.

375
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
Then you make the company like this.

376
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,239
Do I have the right

377
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,320
to hold you accountable?

378
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,159
Good.

379
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,159
We each bear our own responsibilities.

380
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,760
Can you afford this responsibility?

381
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
The company's account was banned.

382
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,000
Investment has also been withdrawn.

383
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,479
We lost tens of millions.

384
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:53,639
Even if I

385
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,040
don't hold you accountable.

386
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,080
Do you think the board

387
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,239
will let you go?

388
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
Why don't you let Meng'an go.

389
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
And I will take care of it for you.

390
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
You still have to be working

391
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,639
in this industry for many years.

392
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,399
You don't need me to teach you, right?

393
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,159
Let's part on good terms.

394
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,479
Let Meng'an back and clean up the mess.

395
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:31,679
I'm not going.

396
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:33,919
What.

397
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,600
Aren't you two friends?

398
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,639
Yes, we are friends.

399
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,800
But this shit?

400
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,840
It's not my business.

401
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,320
Wait, what's "this shit"?

402
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,120
Listen carefully,

403
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,399
you are from the HR Department.

404
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,439
It's your business.

405
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,239
Oh, you're the boss.

406
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,199
If you didn't indulge Huang Sisi,

407
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,439
could Meng'an do this?

408
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:55,840
Whom you offended yourself,

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,080
go and bring her back yourself.

410
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,040
Don't, come on.

411
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,199
I'm begging you.

412
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,800
Don't treat me like that, okay?

413
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,399
Look,

414
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,320
you bring her back.

415
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,360
I apologize to her.

416
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,639
Is that okay?

417
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,280
Then show some sincerity.

418
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,679
What sincerity?

419
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,320
Like this.

420
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,280
Hey, that's enough.

421
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,560
I'm your boss after all.

422
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
Perfect.

423
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,199
You rascals!

424
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,120
Right.

425
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,159
Just throw these

426
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:22,879
messy rubbish

427
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:23,679
all away.

428
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,840
Throw as far as you can.

429
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,239
Anyone else can help?

430
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,159
Come and help.

431
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,560
These, right, right.

432
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,840
Throw them all out, all out.

433
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,679
That,

434
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
there are still some photos of Meng'an

435
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,760
in my office.

436
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,679
Go and get it later.

437
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,560
OK.

438
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,560
Put them in order, to the original place.

439
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:45,879
You won.

440
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,439
Not as happy as I thought.

441
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,919
Now I know

442
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,040
what is the direct-line troops.

443
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,399
You're pretty straightforward.

444
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
That's who I am.

445
00:20:58,399 --> 00:20:58,959
If I want something,

446
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,959
I am always candid about it.

447
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,879
Not like you,

448
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,639
hypocritical.

449
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,520
Do you know

450
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
why you never became

451
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
someone's direct-line buddy?

452
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,399
Because you never

453
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:13,800
gave them reasons to trust you.

454
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,360
I worked hard

455
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,199
to achieve self-value.

456
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,280
Am I wrong?

457
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,040
You are not wrong.

458
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,959
Then why you treated me like that?

459
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,320
How will Mr. Zhang

460
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,000
deal with this matter?

461
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,239
As long as I let you go,

462
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,840
he will let me go.

463
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,239
You think it's unfair?

464
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,239
Of course.

465
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,199
For the matter of my hitting you,

466
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,679
to the most,

467
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,000
I will receive the punishment of Law of

468
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,560
Public Security Administration Punishment.

469
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,000
But for the damage you

470
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,320
caused to the company,

471
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,239
the economic compensation to be paid,

472
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,679
do you think

473
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,439
they can be solved by

474
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,040
that Law?

475
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,000
So, who is Mr. Zhang

476
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,439
protecting after all?

477
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,560
Honestly,

478
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,600
as far as this project is concerned,

479
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,560
if you operate it

480
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,919
with your normal capacity,

481
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,679
you can do it really well.

482
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,679
But obviously you didn't.

483
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,520
Because you wanted it so badly.

484
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,199
So, you chose the quick but dangerous path.

485
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:21,679
But Huang Sisi,

486
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,639
we should have a bottom line as a person.

487
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,639
So does when we

488
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:25,800
dealing with work.

489
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,000
You may not know

490
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,560
that I'm quite envious of you.

491
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,399
Young,

492
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,639
beautiful,

493
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:33,360
competitive.

494
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,959
And hard working.

495
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:35,679
But whether it is

496
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,159
the diligence

497
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,320
or the excessive competition,

498
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,199
it should be done properly.

499
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,679
This world

500
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,840
has no shortcuts.

501
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,159
Because shortcut is biggest detour.

502
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Mr. Zhang, you're looking for me?

503
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,080
What is it?

504
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,199
How's the cleaning up going

505
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,520
for the office of Meng'an?

506
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,479
Do you need my help?

507
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,360
You? Then why we hire cleaners?

508
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,080
You just deal with your own troubles.

509
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,679
Is there anything else?

510
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,639
Meng'an, is she...

511
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:20,439
Just give her some time.

512
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,520
As for the Valuation Adjustment Mechanism

513
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,919
financing scheme on Blue Ocean,

514
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,639
do you have any comments?

515
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,879
Since it's a VAM,

516
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,959
it proves that Mr. Yu is

517
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,239
very confident about himself.

518
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,639
For us,

519
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,040
it is also good news.

520
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,399
Xinmiao has been running poorly recently.

521
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:56,239
It is rushing to get sold.

522
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:57,479
The price is also relatively reasonable.

523
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,479
Blue Ocean acquires Xinmiao.

524
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,320
Then the local internet,

525
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,239
this piece of cake,

526
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,600
will belong to us.

527
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,919
It's like this.

528
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,000
Now,

529
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,840
The world faced by Internet companies

530
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,000
is that cruel.

531
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:11,000
Otherwise, the winner takes it all.

532
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,199
Or you will die a beggar.

533
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,280
Wendy,

534
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,600
What are your comments and suggestions?

535
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,639
I have nothing to suggest.

536
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:21,000
Simply controlling the risk.

537
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,679
The terms of the VAM proposed by Mr. Yu

538
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,239
show his sincerity.

539
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,600
Mr. Yu bears all the risks.

540
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,800
As the investor,

541
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,760
we are happy to see it.

542
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,840
But Mr. Yu,

543
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,080
please think clearly.

544
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,679
It's not too late to regret.

545
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Dear bosses,

546
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,800
you have trusted me so much,

547
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,919
and supported me so much.

548
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,639
I will definitely do my best.

549
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,159
Fine.

550
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,360
That's settled.

551
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:48,120
Proceed with it.

552
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,080
Hopefully we can soon

553
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,239
sign a tripartite agreement.

554
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,040
Deal.

555
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,360
Ms Zhang,

556
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,320
did you see the pictures by paparazzi

557
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,040
that I gave to you?

558
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,879
I saw them.

559
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,679
I also looked into

560
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:01,600
the operation of Mr. Jia's

561
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,679
company recently.

562
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:03,800
Know myself and the enemy

563
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,719
is the way to defeat you.

564
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,120
This marriage defense.

565
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:07,800
Your family's assets

566
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,760
are basically accumulated after marriage.

567
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,040
As the law mandates,

568
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,679
the family property after marriage

569
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,520
belongs to both spouses equally.

570
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,520
But now we

571
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,679
need to avoid that

572
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:17,560
your husband

573
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:18,959
hide your common property by

574
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,560
taking advantage of the company's

575
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:22,600
equity and debt.

576
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,679
I agree to divorce you.

577
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,600
Figured it out.

578
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,760
Let's meet

579
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,840
tomorrow.

580
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,199
I'll decide the time and place.

581
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,639
I will say yes to anything

582
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,560
as long as you show up.

583
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,560
OK. I can fulfill you.

584
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
Mr. Jia,

585
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,239
come in.

586
00:26:58,919 --> 00:26:59,800
Originally,

587
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,919
I planned to visit Meng'an's home,

588
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,040
and talked to her.

589
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,000
But then I think

590
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,479
it is between the two of you.

591
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,000
So, it has to be solved in person.

592
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,080
After all, it's been so many years.

593
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,320
There's nothing we can't speak about.

594
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,239
Apologize.

595
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:16,239
Make request.

596
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
As for who will get blackmailed at last,

597
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,959
it's your show time.

598
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,360
I will avoid.

599
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,959
Meng'an,

600
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,239
at work,

601
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,199
we are a boss-employee relationship.

602
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,679
But in life,

603
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,479
you're my sister.

604
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,760
Recently,

605
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
you have been reminding me.

606
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,320
I know it in my heart that

607
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,360
the reminders were helpful.

608
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,520
But I was

609
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,800
pushed too hard by them.

610
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,439
So, I took a chance.

611
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,600
I thought I can rebound after this fight.

612
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,000
Well,

613
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,399
I didn't expect it would...

614
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
I was wrong, sister.

615
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,679
How about this.

616
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:20,080
I officially apologize to you.

617
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,040
Mr. Zhang,

618
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,879
no need for this between us.

619
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,959
After all, I've been after you for years.

620
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,639
I still have loyalty to

621
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,080
you and Xinmiao.

622
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:34,439
I,

623
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,239
let me put it this way.

624
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,159
You can have my words,

625
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,159
that as long as I can work for one day,

626
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,840
I will definitely do my best.

627
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,080
Well then,

628
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,040
content rectification will depend on you.

629
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:52,360
Whether the company can survive,

630
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
it's all up to you.

631
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,919
To be honest

632
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,679
It's not that easy.

633
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,800
But we need to act fast.

634
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,479
Because once it was banned too long,

635
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,479
it would be very difficult

636
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,919
if we want to activate it again.

637
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,239
Director Xu,

638
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,760
you are finally back!

639
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,239
I miss you so much.

640
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:11,879
Why am I so unconvinced.

641
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:12,560
It's true.

642
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,879
When Ms. Huang was around,

643
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,679
I stood on your side faithfully.

644
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:16,679
She

645
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,520
almost blew our

646
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,080
company up.

647
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,439
A real mess!

648
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,040
If we don't activate the account,

649
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,040
the company will be doomed.

650
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,479
Director Xu,

651
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,320
as soon as you left,

652
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
the content department was in a mess!

653
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:28,800
Our marketing department

654
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,000
was incriminated for that too.

655
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,520
Tens of millions of compensations!

656
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,280
Thank God you're back.

657
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:34,919
Or those investors will

658
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,199
sue me definitely.

659
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:37,280
Mr. Zhang,

660
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,760
I said everything you wanted to say.

661
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,560
Don't bother to remind me that, get out.

662
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,040
Yeah. I get out. Out.

663
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,439
It's nice to see you back, Director Xu.

664
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,479
Hurry up.

665
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,520
Hurry up. Hurry up.

666
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,639
I will try my best.

667
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,879
Why do you take me here?

668
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:51,760
This warehouse

669
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:55,439
is the starting point of our business.

670
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,399
I've paid the rent for thirty years.

671
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,280
I thought you rent it to someone else.

672
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,239
I won't get rich by that.

673
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,000
Keep it.

674
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,120
As a memorial.

675
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,040
Fine.

676
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,159
Keep it if you like it.

677
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,719
The lawyer is still waiting.

678
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Hurry up and sign the agreement.

679
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,719
Haowen,

680
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,479
do you remember this batch of goods?

681
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,239
The inventory of our online store.

682
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,840
What?

683
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:26,879
I still remember that

684
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,239
the sales volume of the online shop

685
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,360
was rocketing during the Double 11

686
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,719
in those years.

687
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,199
So, we took out all our savings

688
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,199
to make the patterns

689
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
of the clothes.

690
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,679
At that time, we thought

691
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,719
they would be a season hit,

692
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,280
right?

693
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,199
But the sale volume was poor.

694
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,320
Traffic was diverted by the big brands.

695
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,080
Tens of thousands of down jackets

696
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,399
were overstocked all at once.

697
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,959
We owed a lot of money to

698
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,199
material suppliers and the factories.

699
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Do you remember?

700
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,800
I still remember.

701
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,399
To sell this batch of goods,

702
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:04,919
you traveled through the whole nation.

703
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,600
From winter to summer.

704
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
At last, you sold this batch of goods

705
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,919
a low price.

706
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,000
And we recovered the loss a little.

707
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,879
Then, we returned money to the suppliers

708
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,000
and contract factories.

709
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,080
From one place to another.

710
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,120
To pay back money.

711
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,239
Everyone thinks

712
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,719
that we can't pay this debt.

713
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,840
But we did it anyway.

714
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,399
Because of this credibility,

715
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,399
later they agreed

716
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,840
to transact on credit.

717
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,159
Later,

718
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,399
we found that copy patterns were not OK.

719
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:32,679
We needed our own brand...

720
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:36,439
Are you over?

721
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Don't be sensational.

722
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,199
The lawyer is still waiting.

723
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,360
Sign the divorce papers quickly.

724
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,600
Jia Haowen,

725
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,080
when will you stop pretending?

726
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,399
Pretending? What am I pretending?

727
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,000
I give you one chance.

728
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:48,840
Tell me the truth.

729
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,760
The truth is,

730
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,399
hurry up and sign the divorce papers.

731
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,679
I received the notice from the bank

732
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,639
You paid off the mortgage on the villa.

733
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,040
Because I am the property owner.

734
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,159
You did this

735
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
simply to make sure

736
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,399
the villa could be mine completely

737
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,520
after the divorce, right?

738
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,080
Yeah, I said that.

739
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,639
You will have the children and the house.

740
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:07,639
I will get the company.

741
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,879
That's what I said.

742
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,639
What an actor.

743
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,000
Keep acting.

744
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:12,360
Where is the company?

745
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,439
You don't have a company.

746
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,080
I knew about the bankruptcy.

747
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,520
And,

748
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,919
you were beaten by the debt collectors.

749
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:39,000
I also knew that.

750
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,000
You are such a slippery fellow.

751
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,320
You paid off the bank's mortgage,

752
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,600
yet had no money to pay back our boss?

753
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,439
Isn't it

754
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,080
something wrong with your character?

755
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,360
You need an education.

756
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,679
Carry on.

757
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,919
The most valuable things in our house

758
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:05,879
are all here.

759
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,800
Plus this.

760
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,759
Jia Haowen, listen to me carefully.

761
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm your wife.

762
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,319
I'm liable for your debts also.

763
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,759
I won't let you face it alone.

764
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,960
Xin,

765
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,120
I don't want

766
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,560
you and the kids get involved.

767
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,199
What about you?

768
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,839
Can you hide away forever?

769
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,440
Credibility is the most important.

770
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Then you will

771
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,040
never be an upright

772
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,920
man, and businessman

773
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,319
once again.

774
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,239
I consulted with my lawyer.

775
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,920
I have my way.

776
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,279
You don't have to

777
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,920
worry about it.

778
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,719
I also consulted my lawyer.

779
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:14,520
Instead of hiding away,

780
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,359
why don't we pay back the debt,

781
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,759
and start over?

782
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:22,679
How do we pay back so much money?

783
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,960
The lawyer analyzed the situation for me.

784
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,400
I'll mortgage the villa

785
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,799
and the

786
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:28,920
small apartment

787
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,159
you bought for me.

788
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,440
The amount of the loans

789
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,319
is almost enough to pay the debts.

790
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,759
Darling,

791
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,880
I'm sorry.

792
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,839
When we got married, I swore

793
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,560
to give you and the kids

794
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,799
the best future.

795
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,199
But I screwed it up.

796
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,839
I'm really sorry.

797
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:56,199
When we got married,

798
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,359
we swore in front of the whole family,

799
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,000
that

800
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,120
we will grow old together

801
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,080
and never leave or give up on each other.

802
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,560
We are far from it

803
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,880
You are already breaking your promise?

804
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,560
Who do you think I am?

805
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,839
I'm Xu Mengxin. I'm your wife.

806
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,639
Can't let you say "divorce" and be done.

807
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:12,319
If you dare to ask divorce again,

808
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:12,839
believe it or not,

809
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:13,520
I will marry someone else right away,

810
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
with the two children.

811
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,080
You will never

812
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,639
see Xiongxiong and Little Watermelon.

813
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,080
I'm so sorry.

814
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,000
I screwed it up.

815
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,799
I'm sorry.

816
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,520
You fool.

817
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,480
Come over.

818
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,440
Tell me about the nightclub?

819
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,199
Oh, darling.

820
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,440
Mr. Jia,

821
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,679
come in.

822
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,199
I knew you don't have the gut.

823
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,319
Since when did you

824
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,920
start to use two mobile phones?

825
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,639
Mr. Jia,

826
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,639
come in.

827
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,159
You don't need to go in.

828
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,799
Didn't you say

829
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,319
that you need pick up Meng'an later?

830
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:30,839
It's okay.

831
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,159
Mr. Ma said that

832
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,159
we must take good care of you.

833
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,120
I am already well taken care of.

834
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,239
You picked me up at the airport.

835
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,159
I'm very touched.

836
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,319
Go back now.

837
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:39,839
In case your wife misunderstands it.

838
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,319
That's okay.

839
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,000
Look,

840
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:45,000
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

841
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,799
And show you around our school.

842
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,719
Take a look.

843
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,199
OK.

844
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,480
But the thing I told you,

845
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,000
please think seriously about it.

846
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,799
Okay, sure.

847
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:54,560
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

848
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,319
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

849
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:55,799
OK. OK.

850
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:56,319
Please take it for me.

851
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,000
Bye-bye.

852
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,600
ID card.

853
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,679
Registered with the ID card.

854
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Just sign up.

855
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,520
Dear.

856
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,480
Here you come.

857
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,040
Why are you wearing slippers?

858
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:23,759
Are you OK?

859
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:24,400
My feet are swollen.

860
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,839
Won't fit in leather shoes.

861
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:27,520
So, I bought a pair of slippers online.

862
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,480
Do you need to go to the hospital?

863
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,279
No need. It has swollen before.

864
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,759
Exercise more.

865
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:33,279
Eat less salt.

866
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:33,639
OK.

867
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,239
Sister is home.

868
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,679
She cooked the anti-inflammatory soup.

869
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:36,279
Right.

870
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,279
Go home and have some soup.

871
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,159
I'll drink some too.

872
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,799
You're swelling in feet as well?

873
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,719
A little.

874
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,120
Share me some.

875
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,400
What's in the back?

876
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,600
Mei Yiduo returned to China.

877
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,799
The silk scarf for you.

878
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,159
The chocolate for Yunjie.

879
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,239
Your ex-girlfriend

880
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,600
bought gifts for your wife and child.

881
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,319
What's her intention?

882
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,480
And you picked her up?

883
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,040
What's your intention?

884
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,920
Are you trying to be difficult now?

885
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,719
Why can't I? Huh?

886
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,520
Fine.

887
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,279
Then you tell me why she did all these.

888
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,799
A man must be crystal clear about it

889
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,520
when there is a woman

890
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,080
like him.

891
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,199
It's obvious, isn't it?

892
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,000
But I shouldn't take it.

893
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,799
Why?

894
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,080
Inappropriate.

895
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,719
Inappropriate for what?

896
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,920
It is inappropriate when I'm single.

897
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,199
And it is even more inappropriate now.

898
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,080
Right?

899
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,600
Aren't you thinking about

900
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,000
resuming the romance again?

901
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,480
What?

902
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,480
Can you stop being so mean?

903
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,480
Very soon.

904
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,400
There's a red light ahead.

905
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,639
This is an early warning.

906
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,400
Aren't you feeling so proud?

907
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,600
What proud? No.

908
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:11,960
Li Lin,

909
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,839
does this silk scarf look good?

910
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,639
You are not getting over with it, right?

911
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:25,679
What's going on?

912
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:29,480
Very good!

913
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,040
Very beautiful.

914
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,440
It suits your skin well.

915
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,040
Yes, mom. It is very beautiful.

916
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:36,799
Is the chocolate delicious?

917
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:37,480
Yummy.

918
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,239
Is there any more?

919
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:39,359
Any more?

920
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,000
The dad?

921
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,839
Sure.

922
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,679
She will have more.

923
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,759
Lin,

924
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:44,440
I don't know

925
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,120
you are such a good buyer!

926
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:46,719
Sister.

927
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:47,920
Yeah, he is good.

928
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:52,319
Eat your food.
