00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:45,530
Just in Time EP04

3
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,040
Did you bring the booze?

4
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,719
Yep, I got it.

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,120
Great.

6
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,120
Wait, you want to drink?

7
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,320
Just a little.

8
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,199
Did anything big happen to you?

9
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,960
You know, drinking alcohol can boost courage.

10
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,199
Two bottles...

11
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,240
Two bottles should be enough, right?

12
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,839
Two bottles? That's too much.

13
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,319
I will get drunk.

14
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,480
You drink with me.

15
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,559
No problem.

16
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
I'll prepare some great seafood for you.

17
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,039
Hit me one more time.

18
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,960
Son,

19
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,039
eat more shrimp.

20
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,879
Dad made some really good shrimp today.

21
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,240
Come on,

22
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,439
Brother-in-law.

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,279
Brother-in-law.

24
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,319
Are you okay?

25
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,839
I'm okay.

26
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,279
I can still have a couple more sips.

27
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,640
Pour some more.

28
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,400
This wine is really good today.

29
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,080
Let's have another drink together.

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,680
Okay.

31
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,439
Enough, enough.

32
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,360
We have two bottles.

33
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,640
Let me finish this first, then we'll pour more.

34
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:35,999
Enough.

35
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:36,480
Enough.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,480
Jia Haowen.

37
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,680
You're quite willing to drink with others.

38
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,759
Well,

39
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,319
When eating seafood, drinking liquor

40
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,480
is for sterilization.

41
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,599
Sister,

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,159
why don't you have some too?

43
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,680
Are you sure?

44
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,879
Let's just drink together.

45
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,879
Okay, okay.

46
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,120
It smells so good! What are you eating?

47
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,240
Yunjie is back.

48
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,120
Come on, come on.

49
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,719
I made a lot of delicious dishes. Here, try some.

50
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,879
Aunt, Uncle!

51
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,640
You are back!

52
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,759
Have you eaten?

53
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,360
I've already eaten at He Lu's home.

54
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,640
You haven't tried this.

55
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,360
This seafood was just made by your uncle.

56
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,039
It's really good.

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
Have another bite.

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,080
Here, you sit here.

59
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,480
Okay.

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,120
I'll get you chopsticks and a bowl.

61
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:25,520
Come on.

62
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,960
Xiongxiong, you are here.

63
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,559
Did you mess with my stuff?

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:30,999
No.

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,360
Really?

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,520
Hurry up and eat shrimp.

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,759
Eat shrimp.

68
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,840
They've all left.

69
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,079
What's going on with you and Jia Haowen?

70
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,519
What do you really want to do?

71
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,999
I'm sorry,

72
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,800
I shouldn't have kept this from you.

73
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,800
I'm not angry with you.

74
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm angry with myself.

75
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,439
I didn't even notice

76
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,600
you were unemployed for so long.

77
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,120
No, no.

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I just didn't want you to know.

79
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,959
I told a lie,

80
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,519
and then kept having to cover it up.

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,639
At work,

82
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,120
you're already so tired.

83
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:09,879
In life,

84
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
I don't want to add

85
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
any more pressure.

86
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,999
Then give me a hug.

87
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,360
I just had a dream about my dad.

89
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,079
I told him I regretted

90
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,040
not learning traditional Chinese medicine from him.

91
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,759
If I had learned it

92
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
and had a skill,

93
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,240
I wouldn't be so useless now.

94
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,439
Be more confident.

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,680
I know

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,999
my own level.

97
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,840
You are right.

98
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,439
I haven't made

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,959
much progress in these years.

100
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,399
It's not that.

101
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
It's because of this family.

102
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,840
It's me and Yunjie who have dragged you down.

103
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,240
Actually,

104
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,399
I've been thinking these past couple of days.

105
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
If you hadn't

106
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
left Beijing with me back then,

107
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,600
would things

108
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
be better now?

109
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,439
Maybe you could have even become a professor

110
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,079
or maybe even a scientist.

111
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm unlikely to become a scientist,

112
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,199
I know myself

113
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,079
very well.

114
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,720
too passive.

116
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,600
If it weren't for you

117
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
leading the way these years,

118
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,800
I might be in an even worse situation

119
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
than now.

120
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,160
I am content

121
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,759
with you

122
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,720
and Yunjie.

123
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,680
Actually, I know it myself.

124
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,319
All these years,

125
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,280
I've been focused on myself.

126
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
And you've

127
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,079
been too indulgent with me.

128
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,959
You've taken care of everything,

129
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,240
big and small, around our home.

130
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm really

131
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,040
not a great wife.

132
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,240
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,720
You're amazing.

134
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,079
Really?

135
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,480
Isn't it just that you're more career-focused?

136
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
But one of us

137
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,559
has to

138
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,439
take care of the home, right?

139
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,639
That's true.

140
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,240
You could call it sacrifice.

141
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,679
But honestly,

142
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,440
my parents passed away early,

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,879
so taking good care of the family

144
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,399
is what I really want to do.

145
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,399
How can you say that?

146
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,080
Haven't you ever wondered

147
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,120
what it would be like

148
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240
if you weren't with me?

149
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,240
No.

150
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,320
Being with you

151
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,679
makes me feel so secure.

152
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
I don't have to think about anything else.

153
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,679
Did you also feel secure

154
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,720
when you were

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,399
with Mei Yiduo?

156
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,399
Who?

157
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,720
Dad!

158
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,960
Hurry up and change,

159
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,919
it's time to go.

160
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,080
I...

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
Your dad's not going to work today.

162
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,279
Yes.

163
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,080
Not going to work again?

164
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,799
No,

165
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,879
he's meeting a client.

166
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,999
Not going to the office.

167
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:11,360
Yes,

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm going to meet a client.

169
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,440
Dad, your job

170
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,519
seems pretty easy

171
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,799
compared to my school.

172
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,799
You think your dad has it easy?

173
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,159
He makes you breakfast in the morning,

174
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,560
and picks you up from school in the afternoon.

175
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,360
Is that easy?

176
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,840
That's true.

177
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,560
Are you ready?

178
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,759
Okay, let's go.

179
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,560
I'll drop you off.

180
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,200
No need,

181
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,679
I'm catching a ride with He Lu.

182
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,120
Don't we have a car at home?

183
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,200
Or are you just planning to

184
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,159
stop riding with me altogether?

185
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,679
I just really don't want to listen

186
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,080
to your paid life lessons again.

187
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,840
I'm off.

188
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,799
Paid life lessons?

189
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Are they really that bad?

190
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,279
Bye.

191
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,560
I think they're great!

192
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,600
I've learned a lot,

193
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,679
and sometimes

194
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,759
they even make me enlightened!

195
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,399
Right?!

196
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:48,759
Yes.

197
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
She is still a kid.

198
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm thinking maybe

199
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,759
I should find a chance

200
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,480
to tell her about my situation.

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,519
There's no need.

202
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,360
It's not like you'll be unemployed forever.

203
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,679
That's true.

204
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Since she's out

205
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,480
and we've got some time.

206
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,320
Let's settle the score.

207
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,960
Settle the score?

208
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,120
Settle the score again?

209
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,080
Didn't I just

210
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
clear my name recently?

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
I mean our budget.

212
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,399
We spend around

213
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,399
2,000 yuan a month on groceries

214
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,120
and cooking at home.

215
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,480
I spend about

216
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,639
50 yuan a day on lunch at work,

217
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,919
so that's around 1,500 yuan

218
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,440
a month for 30 days.

219
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,360
Coffee costs about 400 or 500 yuan.

220
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,440
400 or 500?

221
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,919
Let's write down 500 first.

222
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,120
Yunjie's English

223
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,320
and piano classes

224
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,080
cost 3,000 yuan a month,

225
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,120
which is 36,000 a year.

226
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,080
Is it really that hard

227
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,360
to find a job now?

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,679
You're even calculating expenses annually?

229
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,320
Let's be conservative

230
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,080
and calculate it annually.

231
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,600
The car!

232
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,799
And the car.

233
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,679
Gas costs

234
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,080
about 500 yuan a month.

235
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
And washing, maintenance,

236
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,200
and repairs...

237
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,480
That's easily another

238
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,200
1,000 yuan a month.

239
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,799
I think we could

240
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,960
cut back a bit in that area.

241
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,240
But some expenses we can't avoid.

242
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,200
Every month,

243
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,039
utilities like water, electricity, and gas

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,879
cost 500 yuan.

245
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,919
We need to charge 400 yuan per month for our two phones.

246
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,399
Visiting our parents once a week,

247
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,320
and we need to buy something.

248
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,159
That's another 400-500 yuan a month,

249
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,159
so over 1,000 yuan altogether.

250
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,440
Four weeks a month,

251
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
that's 2,000 yuan.

252
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,960
2000, 2000...

253
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,480
And that's not counting anything else.

254
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,720
We wouldn't be able to buy clothes,

255
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,039
shoes,

256
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,999
go shopping,

257
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,240
watch movies,

258
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,320
or even eat out.

259
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,679
If we do,

260
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:37,759
we'd run out of money

261
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,679
and will have a fiscal deficit.

262
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,039
How much savings do you have left?

263
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,240
Over 20,000 yuan.

264
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,560
I'll transfer some money to you later.

265
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,919
And you pay this month's mortgage first.

266
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,519
If we had known earlier,

267
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,120
we should have saved more.

268
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,560
Let's not dwell on the past.

269
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,159
So,

270
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,240
we can cut back on the money

271
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
we give to my parents,

272
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,519
and I'll stop drinking coffee.

273
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,759
And I'll stop eating lunch out.

274
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,560
You can't cut lunch!

275
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:05,840
You need to eat lunch.

276
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,440
I'll make your lunch from now on.

277
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,200
Cooking at home

278
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,960
is healthier anyway.

279
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,320
I've got some good news.

280
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,919
I've found some

281
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,080
great ways to cut costs.

282
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,999
Why go to the supermarket to buy things?

283
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Because there are specials.

284
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,480
A fish

285
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,519
costs 15 yuan in the morning,

286
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,960
but after 4:30 PM,

287
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,960
it's only 10 yuan.

288
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,639
A carton of eggs is 27 yuan,

289
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,600
but there's a promotion

290
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,720
where they're free

291
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,840
at certain times.

292
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,799
If you time it right,

293
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,440
you can get

294
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,519
that carton of eggs

295
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,679
for free.

296
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,639
Do you know the livestream channel?

297
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,560
Do you know the giveaway items?

298
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,679
Do you know the lucky bags?

299
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,360
If you're patient enough,

300
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
you can get all sorts of things:

301
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,480
chickens, ducks,

302
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,240
fish, meat.

303
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Flash sales?

304
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,960
Yes, flash sales.

305
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720
These are all great methods,

306
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,840
but we can't just

307
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,440
focus on cutting costs.

308
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,120
We need to increase our income as well.

309
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,320
When are you planning

310
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,039
to contact

311
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,639
the CEO you met in Beijing.

312
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,440
I'll give him a call in a bit.

313
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,519
You've got to strike while the iron's hot.

314
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,200
Otherwise, in a few days,

315
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,960
he might not even remember who you are.

316
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,480
Okay.

317
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,600
This job was introduced

318
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,200
to you by Mei Yiduo.

319
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
There's no shame

320
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,480
in asking her for help with finding a job.

321
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,360
What are you doing?

322
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,919
Didn't you say you needed to restock?

323
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
Li Lin isn't doing well.

324
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,560
How did he switch to a domestic one?

325
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,080
I bought this, okay?

326
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,440
Guess there is no love between same genders.

327
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,519
Eat or not?

328
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,480
Sure!

329
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,519
Mr. Zhang is looking for you.

330
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,120
What's going on?

331
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,159
Mr. Lan was personally approached by the boss and has already left the company.

332
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,200
When did that happen?

333
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,120
Just now.

334
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,080
The two Content Departments are merging.

335
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,240
Seize the opportunity,

336
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
you're due for a promotion.

337
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,360
Will there be a raise?

338
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,639
Your level is not something I can decide.

339
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,879
The boss has to decide that.

340
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,720
Make sure you negotiate well.

341
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,879
Mr. Zhang.

342
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,519
Were you looking for me?

343
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,919
Yes, have a seat.

344
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,639
I wanted to discuss something with you.

345
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,240
Mr. Lan from the Content Department

346
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,080
suddenly submitted his resignation.

347
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,200
Mr. Lan is leaving?

348
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,200
The process is already underway.

349
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm thinking

350
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
we merge Content Department One and Two,

351
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
and I'd like you to take charge.

352
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,840
What do you think?

353
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,560
If we can merge the Content Departments,

354
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,960
it should definitely boost efficiency.

355
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:49,960
Alright,

356
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,960
go ahead and coordinate the handover with him.

357
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,600
Then

358
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,080
draft a merger plan

359
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,360
and bring it to me for review.

360
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,960
Sure,

361
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,519
I'll get it done.

362
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,080
Well,

363
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,039
anything else?

364
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,679
Well,

365
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,720
once

366
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,320
the content center is established,

367
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,039
what should everyone call me?

368
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,720
Content Director,

369
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,120
CCO (Chief Culture Officer).

370
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,960
Chief Content Officer...

371
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,919
Then my salary would be on par with a VP's, right?

372
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,679
Pretty much.

373
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,240
I'll talk to Rachel about it then.

374
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,679
What do you mean, talk to Rachel?

375
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,159
About the salary, of course.

376
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,360
She can't handle this,

377
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,639
you need to discuss it with me.

378
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
So, what do you think?

379
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,999
I think...

380
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,720
I've sold my house already.

381
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,200
Don't you know what's going on

382
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,480
with the company right now?

383
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,200
Once I'm back on my feet,

384
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,440
I'll make up for it, I promise.

385
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,080
So, what am I now?

386
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,080
Here,

387
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,600
take this for now.

388
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,919
I'll definitely make it up to you later.

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,959
What's going on now?

390
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,479
The Content Director's raise.

391
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,239
Xu Meng'an, you're really something.

392
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,439
Negotiating a raise that's different from everyone else's.

393
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,560
In all my years,

394
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,879
I've never heard of

395
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,040
a Content Director getting a raise

396
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,840
in the form of a shopping card.

397
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,080
How did you manage that?

398
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,760
Teach me your ways!

399
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,959
Don't distract me.

400
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,719
Quickly find out

401
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,679
for me

402
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,000
how much

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,360
a Content Director earns per month?

404
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:13,840
There's no need to ask around.

405
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,760
How can I manage this role

406
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
without knowing the market rates?

407
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,879
So, how much should I ask for?

408
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,040
I can't tell you.

409
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,080
First, I don't want to hurt your feelings,

410
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,639
and second, I have to consider Mr. Zhang.

411
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,159
What if you

412
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,199
find out and get unhappy,

413
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,320
and quit?

414
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,639
What would we do then?

415
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,080
Am I being naive?

416
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:35,959
No,

417
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,479
you're just kind-hearted.

418
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,320
How much money do you think is in the card

419
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:45,560
One thousand?

420
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,320
Two thousand?

421
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,560
You're thinking too much.

422
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:51,360
Five hundred.

423
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,280
How could it be that low?

424
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,479
The year-end

425
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,199
bonus is usually several thousands

426
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,199
and several thousands.

427
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,320
Yes, that's what I gave to Mr. Zhang.

428
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,679
The cards with more money have already been given away.

429
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,760
There is only a card with a limit of 500 yuan left.

430
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,360
This card is one I gave to him.

431
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,199
How much did you give him?

432
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,639
What do you mean?

433
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,239
I just wondered...

434
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,120
if he could give me one of these cards

435
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,399
every month,

436
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,840
that would be great.

437
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:30,560
Mr. Liu,

438
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,080
this is Li Lin.

439
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,479
Did you review my resume?

440
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,959
Oh, yes, I'm Mei Yiduo's classmate.

441
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,679
Yes, yes.

442
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,520
You are on a business trip.

443
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,199
Beijing.

444
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,439
No, I'm not in Beijing.

445
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm in Chunjiang.

446
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,520
Okay, okay.

447
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,639
Okay, okay. I...

448
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,439
Next time I'm in Beijing,

449
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,600
I'll visit you. Is that okay?

450
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,239
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

451
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,239
Okay, okay.

452
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,239
Okay, okay, okay.

453
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,199
Bye, bye.

454
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:58,840
Awkward.

455
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,560
What's going on?

456
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:03,919
Where did you get the discounted eggs?

457
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,719
Over there, over there.

458
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:05,239
Okay, okay.

459
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,120
Get me a box of the discounted eggs!

460
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,520
the discounted eggs!

461
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,000
One box per person.

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,080
Give me one first! Just give me one first!

463
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,399
Watch out, my basket.

464
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,159
Sorry, sorry.

465
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,040
Don't push, don't push.

466
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,120
You stepped on my foot.

467
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,520
Young man...

468
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,080
Give me one!

469
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,320
Young man,

470
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,280
could you please

471
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,760
grab a box for me?

472
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,199
You want one box?

473
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:18,679
Alright, alright.

474
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,800
I'll squeeze in first.

475
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,639
Hello?

476
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:21,239
Mr. Li,

477
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:21,919
Get me a box, please.

478
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:22,360
This is Zhao.

479
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,719
Your resume is impressive,

480
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:25,679
but we don't have

481
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,560
any current hiring plans

482
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,120
at our company.

483
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,560
Thank you.

484
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,080
I'm sorry about that.

485
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,919
Okay, okay, thank you thank you.

486
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm sorry.

487
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,320
I'm sorry.

488
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:33,919
Bye.

489
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,639
Where are the discount eggs?

490
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,879
They're all gone.

491
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:40,719
They were gone at once.

492
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,360
What's left are the full-price eggs.

493
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,520
Next time, come earlier.

494
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,719
Just answering a phone call,

495
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,080
the eggs were gone.

496
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,439
Dad,

497
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,679
what dish are you planning to cook?

498
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,159
Isn't this loofah?

499
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,959
Isn't that pumpkin?

500
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:00,879
I'll fry them together.

501
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,199
What's gone?

502
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:04,919
Nothing, nothing,

503
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,719
just the eggs.

504
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,320
Eggs?

505
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,239
There are plenty of eggs.

506
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,199
How could they be gone?

507
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,879
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

508
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:11,959
There are still eggs at home,

509
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:12,439
so we won't buy more.

510
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:13,600
No need to buy more.

511
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,280
Let's go.

512
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,320
Can these two be fried together and taste good?

513
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,199
It's really delicious.

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,919
Dad, sit here.

515
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,159
Eat slowly.

516
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,919
Here, switch to this one.

517
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,199
This popsicle is good.

518
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:25,399
The other one has too much sugar.

519
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:26,239
Too much sugar,

520
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:26,959
made of chocolate.

521
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,800
This one has no sugar

522
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,840
and no fat.

523
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,080
This is good and healthy.

524
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,919
What's going on?

525
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,520
At home,

526
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
my wife manages me.

527
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,520
And now, out here,

528
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,919
my daughter's husband has to manage me too?

529
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,800
This has too much sugar-too sweet.

530
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,360
But life should be sweet, right?

531
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,879
It's fine, let me eat it. It's no big deal.

532
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:44,760
Alright,

533
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
just eat slowly, this one is too cold.

534
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
How come you have time to shop at the supermarket?

535
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,600
Well, today I

536
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,719
have a meeting

537
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,520
with a client later,

538
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,520
so I am not too busy.

539
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,679
Earlier, when I

540
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,959
was picking out loofahs,

541
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,840
I heard

542
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,239
the supermarket staff mention that

543
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,560
the discounted eggs had arrived.

544
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,719
I saw a bunch

545
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,800
of elderly people

546
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,120
rushing over,

547
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,439
so I thought I'd check it out.

548
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,360
When I looked up,

549
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,239
I saw someone ahead of me

550
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,840
who looked a lot like you

551
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,040
same height,

552
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,959
same build,

553
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,239
even the same face shape.

554
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,639
I called out,

555
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:22,919
"Li Lin, Li Lin,"

556
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,120
but no one responded.

557
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,919
Then I thought,

558
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:27,840
it can't be you.

559
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,879
You're

560
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,080
a high-level professional,

561
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,199
a white-collar worker.

562
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,000
How could you

563
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,959
be fighting with these elderly folks

564
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,000
for discounted eggs?

565
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,600
Don't you think?

566
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes.

567
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,439
It definitely wasn't you.

568
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,479
It wasn't me.

569
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,239
I must have mistaken someone else.

570
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:43,959
I just

571
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,199
saw them making such a fuss,

572
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:46,479
so I went over to take a look.

573
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:46,879
When I came there, I saw they were

574
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,199
fighting for eggs.

575
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,439
When I turned around,

576
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,439
I saw you were standing behind me.

577
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,679
Yes, yes, that's right.

578
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,399
Didn't I almost hit you with that loofah?

579
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,159
Yes, that's right.

580
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:58,199
Yes.

581
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,479
So, how's work at your place? Busy?

582
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,040
Yes,

583
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,080
quite busy.

584
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,719
Still doing design work?

585
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,760
Yes.

586
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,439
Really busy.

587
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:14,080
But no matter how busy

588
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:14,719
you are,

589
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,679
it's just a pen,

590
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,479
a ruler, a compass,

591
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,600
and a piece of paper, right?

592
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,679
How busy can it be?

593
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:21,439
How long has it been

594
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,959
since you came over to play chess with me?

595
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,439
Look, you're

596
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,760
so busy, you've forgotten.

597
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,239
It's been two weeks.

598
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,919
Two weeks!

599
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:33,800
Indeed.

600
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:35,879
Dad,

601
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,399
I've indeed been quite busy lately.

602
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,560
Yes, you're right.

603
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,080
All those...

604
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,878
All those tasks are still there.

605
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:41,120
Those tasks are still there.

606
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,719
Now, my boss

607
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,800
wants me to

608
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,000
go out

609
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,040
and meet people,

610
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,479
expand business,

611
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,760
and explore the market.

612
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,679
Times have changed.

613
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,280
So...

614
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:57,239
Your boss has given you more responsibilities.

615
00:24:58,919 --> 00:24:59,520
That's a good thing.

616
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:01,800
It means

617
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,479
you're not just doing product design anymore.

618
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,439
You might also get involved

619
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,399
in procurement and sales.

620
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:10,040
Yes,

621
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,919
getting familiar with everything.

622
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,639
Good.

623
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,560
Make sure to cherish this opportunity.

624
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,600
That's how it is.

625
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,360
More skills,

626
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
more options,

627
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:20,959
right?

628
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,679
Don't worry, Dad.

629
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,360
I've got a handle

630
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,399
on work.

631
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,320
Don't mind me being nagging.

632
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm just reminding you a few things.

633
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,560
Also, we

634
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,000
won't play chess anymore.

635
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,800
I'm not playing chess anymore.

636
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,320
I am prepared to keep up with the times.

637
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,000
So what?

638
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Keep up with the pace.

639
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,120
Stratego.

640
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,479
Stratego?

641
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,080
I'm telling you...

642
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,120
Who is playing stratego now?

643
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,800
That's something children play with.

644
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,000
What do you mean a kid's game?

645
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,879
Isn't it for kids,

646
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:45,239
currently?

647
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,239
It's something played by philosophers, thinkers,

648
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,719
writers,

649
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,560
and military strategists.

650
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,399
No, seriously,

651
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,040
are you really busy

652
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,840
or just pretending to be?

653
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,280
Or are you just lounging around at home?

654
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,120
I'm busy,

655
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,760
really busy.

656
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,239
Look at me, I'm out shopping,

657
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,080
and soon I have

658
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,919
to go to meet a client.

659
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:07,080
So you're really busy then.

660
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,000
That's good.

661
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:15,560
Okay.

662
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,199
It's good that you're really busy.

663
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:20,919
I hate lying the most.

664
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:25,959
I can forgive you for causing trouble,

665
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,199
but who taught you to lie?

666
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,879
Mengxin!

667
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,679
What's going on? Why are you so angry?

668
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,399
Alright, calm down.

669
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:33,080
Come on, Wanwan, Zhenzhen,

670
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,560
take your little brother

671
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,399
to play.

672
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,520
What's the matter?

673
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Calm down.

674
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,919
It's not good for the baby.

675
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,080
I understand that

676
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,840
boys can be naughty

677
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,439
and mischievous.

678
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,239
I can even forgive them for causing trouble,

679
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,120
but he can't be playing tricks on the teacher.

680
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:52,040
After he played his prank,

681
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,159
he even lied to me!

682
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,560
Tell me, isn't that infuriating?

683
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,239
Don't get so upset just yet.

684
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,679
Let's figure out why this happened.

685
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,639
Xiongxiong just

686
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:00,520
transferred here, right?

687
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,959
He doesn't have many friends yet.

688
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,560
Maybe he's

689
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,399
playing tricks on the teacher

690
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,280
to get

691
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,719
some attention.

692
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,040
I think

693
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,479
we need to help him

694
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,560
adjust to this new environment quickly.

695
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,520
If he feels more at home,

696
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,679
he won't need to act out

697
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,879
to get noticed.

698
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,879
And since you're pregnant with your second child,

699
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,679
could it be that

700
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,280
you've unintentionally neglected Xiongxiong's feelings?

701
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:28,080
You guys just moved here,

702
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,560
so maybe everything feels new and exciting to you,

703
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,439
but Xiongxiong

704
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,679
lacks a sense of security.

705
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,439
Now that you're expecting a second child,

706
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,280
you should be even more

707
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,040
attentive to your firstborn.

708
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,080
There's precedent for this

709
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,280
in psychology.

710
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Many sensitive children

711
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,879
start exhibiting unusual behaviors

712
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:42,560
when they find out their mom is having another baby.

713
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:43,760
I think you should

714
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,800
observe him closely.

715
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:46,320
Actually, since

716
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,879
we moved to this neighborhood,

717
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,879
it's not just Xiongxiong who feels insecure,

718
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:51,879
I haven't fully adjusted either.

719
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:52,760
Exactly!

720
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,600
When I first moved here,

721
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,399
I noticed how these moms

722
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,679
are really dedicated

723
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,520
to their kids.

724
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,320
They even

725
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,919
have their own little group

726
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,520
that's hard to break into.

727
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,320
So how do I

728
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,239
join these mom groups?

729
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,199
Easy.

730
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,840
Just trade your educational resources

731
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,320
with them.

732
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,840
I just moved here,

733
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,919
I don't have any educational resources.

734
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,560
If you want,

735
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:16,639
I can help you with that.

736
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:18,959
What do you have in mind?

737
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:20,439
I can transfer Wanwan and Zhenzhen's foreign tutor

738
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:22,080
to your Xiongxiong.

739
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,120
Then you share it

740
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,919
with Haoze's mom

741
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,280
and make a trade.

742
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:27,879
That's a great idea!

743
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,919
But if you transfer the tutor to me,

744
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,080
what will Wanwan and Zhenzhen do?

745
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,439
Before, I thought

746
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,760
giving the kids the best education

747
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,399
and the best life

748
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,879
was being responsible.

749
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,919
But now,

750
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,239
I realize that only

751
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,280
by figuring out my own life

752
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,120
and living it well

753
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,159
can I truly do right by them.

754
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:55,919
Here, here, here,

755
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:56,919
your

756
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,159
orange juice.

757
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,000
Why are you coming back so late?

758
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,360
Guess who I ran

759
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,280
into at the supermarket?

760
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,159
Who?

761
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:03,600
Guess.

762
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,560
Chen? Li? Wang?

763
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,159
Liu? Liu? Zhao?

764
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,280
Li.

765
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,399
Your elder son-in-law!

766
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,840
I saw him over there,

767
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,959
grabbing those

768
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,159
discounted eggs!

769
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,679
What? Isn't he supposed to be at work?

770
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,439
I asked him,

771
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,840
I said, "Why aren't you at work?"

772
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,600
He said

773
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,080
he's now out there running the market,

774
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,199
doing sales.

775
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,199
Look, look.

776
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,479
I saw on WeChat's moment

777
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:27,959
that he's selling insurance now.

778
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,800
Look!

779
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,280
Did he change jobs?

780
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:38,959
Honey!

781
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,120
You're back!

782
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,959
Where is your phone?

783
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,760
On the tea table.

784
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm in the middle of a flash sale buying groceries.

785
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,080
Don't touch it, okay?

786
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,800
Flash sale!

787
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,320
Don't touch it!

788
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,679
Why did you delete it?

789
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,719
If you keep posting

790
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,879
those insurance ads,

791
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,919
the whole world's going to know you're unemployed.

792
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,439
You can't post that anymore, got it?

793
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,399
Weren't you the one who said

794
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,399
I should put my pride aside and ask for help?

795
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,439
I meant ask the people

796
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,959
who can actually get you a job!

797
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,439
Selling insurance isn't shameful.

798
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,320
My colleague

799
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,280
sells insurance

800
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,280
and does pretty well at it.

801
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,840
I don't know about others,

802
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,760
but you're definitely not doing well.

803
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,679
Are you someone

804
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,479
who makes money just by talking?

805
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,040
Did you contact the people

806
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
I told you to?

807
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,399
No response?

808
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,199
Look for yourself.

809
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,399
Your resume

810
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,679
isn't working.

811
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,320
What's wrong with it?

812
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,760
Look at the resume

813
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,600
I revised for you

814
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,159
and then compare it to your original one.

815
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,280
No wonder no one's replying to you.

816
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,959
If you can't even sell yourself,

817
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,399
how do you expect to sell insurance?

818
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:02,360
What were you thinking?

819
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,520
But this...

820
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,239
this...

821
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,280
is this still me?

822
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,639
Why wouldn't it be?

823
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,239
Yes, I might have exaggerated

824
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,040
a little when I wrote it.

825
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,600
But that's not the point.

826
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,040
The important thing is

827
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,639
to secure

828
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,800
an interview!

829
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,280
True...

830
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,760
that's what really matters,

831
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:27,600
right?

832
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,159
Exactly.

833
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:30,320
Got it.

834
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,320
Then I

835
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,239
go ahead and send out another round.

836
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,120
Send out another round.

837
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,719
Alright.

838
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,919
About our

839
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,439
household budget deficit,

840
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,719
I have an idea.

841
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,320
What is it?

842
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,919
I heard from a former colleague

843
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:46,959
that in my current situation,

844
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,040
I can go to my original company and get a certificate

845
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,919
saying that I was laid off.

846
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,520
That way, I can claim

847
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,439
unemployment benefits,

848
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,520
two thousand yuan a month,

849
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,840
for two years.

850
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:58,959
What do you think?

851
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,399
No way.

852
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,919
Why?

853
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,320
You've seen

854
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,280
my situation.

855
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,879
It's hard to find a job,

856
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,600
and two thousand yuan a month is not a small amount.

857
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,959
I'll stop as soon as

858
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:13,959
I find a job.

859
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,280
I said no, and that's final.

860
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,280
Why not?

861
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,760
I don't want

862
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,159
you to give up on yourself,

863
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,879
and I don't want

864
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:20,520
to see your name

865
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,560
on that list.

866
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm back!

867
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,919
Oh, you're back.

868
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,719
Alright, I'll start cooking.

869
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,239
What are you drinking?

870
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,280
We're about to eat.

871
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,080
Milk tea.

872
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,120
He Lu gave it to me.

873
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,879
Let's go camping this weekend.

874
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,000
Mrs. Xu.

875
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:50,879
Do you have a lot of free time lately?

876
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:51,919
What's with that tone?

877
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
For the first time in my life,

878
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,040
I don't have to compete with your work for attention.

879
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:56,520
I'm starting to wonder if you're really unemployed.

880
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,879
Didn't we say we'd go camping

881
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,080
when we got the new car?

882
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,760
It's been six months,

883
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,679
and we still haven't gone.

884
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,439
All the camping gear we bought

885
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,719
hasn't even been used once.

886
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:09,959
Are you going or not?

887
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,159
If not, I'll go with your dad.

888
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:14,280
Fine, let's go.

889
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,159
Ha,

890
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,919
why don't you seem excited at all?

891
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,919
We'll go camping!

892
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,679
How excited should I be?

893
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,919
Should I be jumping for joy?

894
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,399
Yeah, yeah! So happy, so happy.

895
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:28,479
Let's go, let's go!

896
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,040
Let's go!

897
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:39,760
See you on Tuesday.

898
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,679
Yeah, see you.

899
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,520
And,

900
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,919
don't forget the homework!

901
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,840
I won't,

902
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,239
bye-bye.

903
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,399
Xiongxiong's mother!

904
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,040
Haoze's mother!

905
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,399
Was that the same tutor

906
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,320
from Mrs. Yu

907
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,040
just now?

908
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:01,879
Yes.

909
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
It was recommended to me by Wanzhen.

910
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,120
Mrs. Yu is really kind to you.

911
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,040
I've heard that tutor

912
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,280
is excellent.

913
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:09,959
I've been

914
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,679
struggling with this lately.

915
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,760
I want to find a tutor

916
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,840
for my son Haoze.

917
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,080
His spoken English

918
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,439
isn't that good,

919
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,679
and I want to help him improve.

920
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,639
You know,

921
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,679
distant relatives aren't as good as close neighbors.

922
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,919
Could you recommend the tutor to me?

923
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,760
I can,

924
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,879
but the thing is,

925
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
this tutor already teaches many children.

926
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,399
I'm afraid they might get spread too thin.

927
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,320
Oh, I almost forgot.

928
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,040
I came to see you about something else.

929
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,319
We're having a party

930
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,960
this weekend.

931
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,600
Since you've

932
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,759
just moved here

933
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:44,279
and haven't joined any gatherings yet.

934
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,960
Why don't you bring Xiongxiong along?

935
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,279
This party

936
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:48,120
could be like

937
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,080
a welcome party

938
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,520
for you.

939
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,759
What do you think?

940
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,279
Well,

941
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,319
okay then.

942
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,679
As for the tutor...

943
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,279
Distant relatives aren't as good as close neighbors, right?

944
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,639
I'll have a word with them.

945
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,839
Wonderful!

946
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,799
I knew it,

947
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:03,400
you're such a kind person,

948
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
Xiongxiong's mom.

949
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
You must come this weekend!

950
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,440
Okay.

951
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,159
We'll be expecting you at the party this weekend!

952
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,480
Thank you!

953
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,040
Bye!

954
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Welcome, Mrs. Jia,

955
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,040
to the Happy Moms Group!

956
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,120
Where did I write it?

957
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,880
Yunjie says we're going camping this weekend,

958
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,400
right?

959
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,199
Right.

960
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,000
We've been talking about it for half a year,

961
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
but we haven't gone yet.

962
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,400
I don't want to disappoint her,

963
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,239
so we should go this time.

964
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,400
Why?

965
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:00,400
I want to sell the car.

966
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:01,480
Sell the car?

967
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:06,920
What about

968
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,759
commuting to work?

969
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:09,920
I can

970
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,000
take a taxi, subway,

971
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,639
or bus to work.

972
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,359
We used to

973
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,719
ride bikes, remember?

974
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,279
And

975
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,920
what about Yunjie?

976
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:21,520
We could

977
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,120
get a small electric bike.

978
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,279
You ride bike with her.

979
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,480
It's not far from school

980
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,279
and there's no traffic.

981
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:31,279
That's a good idea.

982
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,480
But we just bought this car

983
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,120
less than half a year.

984
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,319
If we sell it now,

985
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,440
we'll only get half the price.

986
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,759
I feel bad about it too,

987
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:41,920
but the current situation is different from the past,

988
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,520
and we can't keep living like this.

989
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,159
I checked a second-hand

990
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,239
car website today.

991
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,560
If we sell it well,

992
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,199
it could cover

993
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,639
five or six months of mortgage.

994
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,159
I give you ten months.

995
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:51,759
Can't you

996
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,239
find a job for ten months?

997
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,159
Look,

998
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,560
we calculated

999
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,679
the car costs, including fuel,

1000
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,839
maintenance,

1001
00:36:58,839 --> 00:36:59,759
and washing.

1002
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,679
It's over a thousand a month.

1003
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,440
That's money we could save.

1004
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,400
What do you think?

1005
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,279
Let's think about it some more.

1006
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,440
After all,

1007
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:11,440
switching from an SUV

1008
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,520
to a small electric bike

1009
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,159
might be hard for Yunjie

1010
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,080
to accept right away.

1011
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,920
We can't worry about that too much.

1012
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,319
Let's take her camping

1013
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,440
and cheer her up.

1014
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,679
Next week,

1015
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,400
we should also explain the situation at home

1016
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,639
to her

1017
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,440
so she's mentally prepared.

1018
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:26,400
We'll be going through

1019
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,319
a tough period.

1020
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:53,920
Where are we going?

1021
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,520
Could you help me look at some apartments?

1022
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,279
You want to buy an apartment?

1023
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,120
I want to live closer to you.

1024
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,279
What do you mean by living closer to me?

1025
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,080
You have experience buying houses.

1026
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,400
Could you help me as an advisor?

1027
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,639
I can certainly help as an advisor.

1028
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,799
I have a lot of experience

1029
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,520
in buying houses.

1030
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:26,799
The key

1031
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,040
of the apartment is

1032
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
location, location,

1033
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,159
and location.

1034
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,520
I can help you look at apartments,

1035
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,080
but that's more of a company benefit,

1036
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,759
not a personal favor.

1037
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,440
Okay.

1038
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,679
Which property are we looking at?

1039
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,279
We're almost there.

1040
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,279
Thanks a lot.

1041
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,319
Mr. Zhang, Mrs. Zhang.

1042
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:08,960
Thank you very much.

1043
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,679
Bye.

1044
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,279
Thank you.

1045
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:10,639
Bye, bye.

1046
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:10,960
Bye.

1047
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,880
Wanzhen!

1048
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,159
That materials

1049
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,520
are for our sales department.

1050
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,880
Please send them over as soon as possible!

1051
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,920
Okay, okay!

1052
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:35,679
The apartment of Huaxing?

1053
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,679
I know their boss.

1054
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:38,239
If you plan to buy this apartment,

1055
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,400
I'll invite you for a meal

1056
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,719
and give you

1057
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,600
a discount.

1058
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,239
You mentioned it was a company benefit.

1059
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,040
Is it true?

1060
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,520
You said it earlier.

1061
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,319
I haven't had any drinks.

1062
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,279
Welcome!

1063
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,719
Welcome!

1064
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,960
Wanzhen.

1065
00:40:58,839 --> 00:40:59,799
Why are you here?

1066
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:00,839
Wanzhen,

1067
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:01,920
Wanzhen,

1068
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:03,279
why are you here?

1069
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,319
Are there no sales here?

1070
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm working.

1071
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,600
Working?

1072
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,560
What job are you working for?

1073
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,159
Can't you see I'm working?

1074
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,239
Don't disturb me.

1075
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,719
No, no,

1076
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,679
let me explain.

1077
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,719
Explain what?

1078
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:17,480
This...

1079
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,239
I'll help you with this.

1080
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:20,799
Don't move.

1081
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:21,639
Look.

1082
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,839
This unit is rare

1083
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:23,719
with its north-south orientation.

1084
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,480
Let's go check other properties

1085
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
another day.

1086
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:26,400
Thank you.

1087
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:31,960
You can take another look.

1088
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:36,319
What are you looking at?

1089
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:36,960
Let me help you.

1090
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,279
Are you guys bored at work?

1091
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,279
Go do your own thing.

1092
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:43,000
Don't watch.

1093
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,159
Director Sun,

1094
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,440
the sales department's brochures

1095
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,560
have been delivered.

1096
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,120
Is there anything else you need me to do?

1097
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,120
There's no more work.

1098
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,480
You can leave once you're done.

1099
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,520
Thank you.

1100
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,679
Wanzhen.

1101
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,239
Wanzhen.

1102
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,159
Didn't you say you weren't feeling well recently?

1103
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,279
Why are you out here instead of resting at home?

1104
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:02,839
What about the kids

1105
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:03,719
when you're outside.

1106
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,639
This is where I work.

1107
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:07,080
Don't disturb me, okay?

1108
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:08,239
No, what kind of work is this?

1109
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,880
You're just doing odd jobs here.

1110
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,040
How much can you earn?

1111
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,199
3,500 during the probation period,

1112
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,159
5,000 after becoming permanent.

1113
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:14,600
No, no, no.

1114
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,639
Our family doesn't lack this little bit of money,

1115
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,040
right?

1116
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,199
We won't be a family

1117
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,359
for long.

1118
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,560
I need to get used to

1119
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,759
this working life.

1120
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:22,799
No.

1121
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,159
Look at how you're talking.

1122
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,960
Is it really necessary?

1123
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:29,080
Yes.

1124
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,279
I came to accompany a female colleague

1125
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:31,440
to look at houses today,

1126
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,759
but it doesn't mean

1127
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,040
we're no longer a family.

1128
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,400
Yu Hai,

1129
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,600
actually, I've wanted to talk to you

1130
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,880
about this for a long time.

1131
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,560
But you haven't been coming home lately,

1132
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,080
so I haven't had the chance.

1133
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,080
Today,

1134
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
I want to officially talk

1135
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,639
about our divorce.
