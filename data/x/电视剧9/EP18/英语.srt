00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,600
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:45,530
Just in Time EP18

3
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,760
I mean,

4
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,479
can't you swap out this sofa

5
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,320
for one with a higher back?

6
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,320
You wouldn't come over even if I did.

7
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Seriously,

8
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,400
when was the last time you stopped by?

9
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,120
Too far.

10
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,240
Too tired.

11
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,800
And I'm too busy.

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,599
You just don't want to come over.

13
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,999
If you really want to come, just tell me.

14
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,680
I can send the driver to pick you up.

15
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,719
I don't want to visit your place.

16
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,599
The house is huge,

17
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,120
but even if I stayed here forever,

18
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,200
it would never feel like mine,

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,800
and that's frustrating to see.

20
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,039
Then you're staying here today,

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,640
alright?

22
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:34,879
I'll crash with you tonight.

23
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,039
Give me a break.

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599
Keep the flirtation for Haowen.

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,800
Meng'an,

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,159
have you noticed that

27
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,319
your estrogen levels are a bit unstable

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,240
after pregnancy?

29
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,920
I experienced a threatened miscarriage

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
and received treatment for it last night.

31
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,800
How are you feeling now?

32
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,599
I'll take you

33
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,680
to my doctor.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
How can you keep your little one safe

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,080
with all this running around?

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,279
I don't want to fuss anymore.

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
I just want to get some sleep.

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,839
It's going to take some time for Dad

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,640
to get better,

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,120
and your second child will be born soon.

41
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,599
I must take care of myself to

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,960
take responsibility for the entire family.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,999
Don't worry.

44
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,680
I'll do it after doing the month.

45
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,279
You used to not want another child.

46
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,640
I didn't understand your reasons then,

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,200
but now...

48
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,279
Do you want to give up the baby?

49
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,319
I'm distraught about this.

50
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,920
I'm distraught about this.

51
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,080
Come on. What's the big deal?

52
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,879
You didn't want a second child,

53
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,200
did you?

54
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,599
I'm sure.

55
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,879
You're starting to get all hormonal.

56
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,159
Relax,

57
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,439
relax, relax.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Eat some fruit. It'll help you chill out.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,080
Let me worry for a bit.

60
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,520
One, two, three.

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,839
Nice job.

62
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,439
Great.

63
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,439
Good, good.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,439
Come on.

65
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Stand a little farther back.

66
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,520
One, two, three.

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,599
One...

68
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:18,839
Well done.

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,879
Wanwan, Zhenzhen.

70
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,559
Mom.

71
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,120
Mom.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,080
Mom,

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,999
let's play together,

74
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:24,759
let's play together.

75
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,399
Dr. Yu.

76
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,439
Ms. Chen.

77
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,759
Yesterday afternoon,

78
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,319
I was upset with Xiongxiong's Grandma

79
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,439
and said Jia's family

80
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,040
was treating me like a baby-making machine

81
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,600
as I didn't want a second child,

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,999
but they pressured me to have one.

83
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:26,999
Then,

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,199
Dad went to the hospital that night.

85
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,639
But today,

86
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,680
I've changed my mind.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,519
What are you talking about?

88
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,879
Can't you get to the point?

89
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
The point is

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
I no longer have to say that

91
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,399
others forced me to have a second child.

92
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,199
It's my decision to have a second child.

93
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
Not only do I want to have a second child,

94
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,199
but if I'm physically able

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,639
after giving birth to

96
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,399
my second child,

97
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,680
I'll have a third child.

98
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
You're being willful again.

99
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,999
That's not like you at all.

100
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,680
Meng'an,

101
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,519
please keep the baby.

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,800
Let's have our second child together.

103
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,840
I'll take you

104
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,639
to the hospital tomorrow.

105
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,439
I'll make sure you have the best doctor

106
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,639
and the best room.

107
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,439
If you're admitted,

108
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,399
you can keep the baby.

109
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,680
I don't need to be admitted.

110
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,160
I have to go to the office and do my job.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,759
Come on.

112
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,720
Don't be ridiculous.

113
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,519
Let's go to sleep.

114
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,840
Dad will move to a new ward tomorrow.

115
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,399
Meng'an, listen to me,

116
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,120
don't worry about that.

117
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,720
I'll take care of Dad.

118
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,959
There's Haowen

119
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,879
and Li Lin too.

120
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,160
We're all here for Dad.

121
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,800
You should prioritize

122
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,199
the baby in your belly.

123
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,439
We have different situations.

124
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm not in a position to have a child.

125
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:40,920
But don't worry.

126
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,199
Even if I cannot keep my baby,

127
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,120
I promise to

128
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,600
treat your second child well,

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,240
as a good aunt

130
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,800
should.

131
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,600
Meng'an, don't give up.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,879
Let me show you a photo.

133
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:57,480
See,

134
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,720
this is the photo.

135
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,720
It got me thinking about how lucky

136
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,840
I am to be expecting my second child.

137
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:09,840
Otherwise,

138
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
when Haowen and I get old,

139
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,439
Xiongxiong will be alone.

140
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
He would be so lonely

141
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
and under so much pressure,

142
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,879
but if he had a sibling,

143
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,240
they could lean on each other,

144
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,199
just like you and me.

145
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,519
Did Dad's illness

146
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,720
upset you?

147
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:28,920
It makes you think

148
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,319
having a sibling is good.

149
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,999
You can talk to each other

150
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,399
and help each other

151
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,999
in tough times.

152
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,519
Dad's sudden illness

153
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,480
took me by surprise

154
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,999
and caused me a lot of worry,

155
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,399
but with your support

156
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,399
and the whole family

157
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,639
helping out,

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,999
I feel so much better.

159
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,840
Meng'an,

160
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,639
please keep the baby,

161
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,799
okay?

162
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,799
Didn't you ask me

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,360
what Dad said to me

164
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,639
in the ICU?

165
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah,

166
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
but you didn't share anything.

167
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,639
Dad told me to keep the baby.

168
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
See...

169
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,720
Since Dad advised you to keep the baby,

170
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,799
you should follow his guidance.

171
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,240
It's not a matter of obeying Dad's words.

172
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,039
I initially didn't want a second baby,

173
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,200
but now my body cannot keep it.

174
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,240
It's not the same thing.

175
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,480
Forget it.

176
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,799
Leave it to Darwin.

177
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,080
Who's Darwin?

178
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,200
Is he a doctor or something?

179
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
Haha, just kidding.

180
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,639
I know him.

181
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,560
Look at your eyes.

182
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,560
The guy developed the theory of evolution,

183
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,039
right?

184
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,200
Come here,

185
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,279
The ER doctor said

186
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,279
that if I ended up

187
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,399
losing the baby,

188
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,440
it's just nature doing its thing

189
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,399
with the survival of the fittest,

190
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
so we shouldn't be too insistent.

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,399
Why shouldn't we be insistent?

192
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
We must be insistent on keeping the baby.

193
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,080
Nowadays, science is very advanced,

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,840
so why not consider keeping the baby?

195
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,879
Get treatment to keep your baby,

196
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,720
for god's sake.

197
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Do you know what Haowen said

198
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,720
at the beginning?

199
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,799
He said that if he ever gets old

200
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,039
and sick to the point of

201
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,799
being stuck in bed,

202
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,440
having only one child

203
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,999
would be really tough.

204
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,679
With two kids,

205
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,919
they can make decisions collectively.

206
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,560
Shall we pull the plug on Dad? Okay.

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,360
It's a good idea to discuss it,

208
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,399
right?

209
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,759
Haowen can be so dramatic.

210
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,639
You're right.

211
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,320
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to

212
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,519
live with him so peacefully.

213
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,159
You two are funny.

214
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,159
What's going on?

215
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,639
I think the baby

216
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,080
overheard us

217
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,519
and came early.

218
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,879
What?

219
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,600
What should we do, Meng'an?

220
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,799
It's not time yet.

221
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,399
What if the baby

222
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,440
doesn't grow up?

223
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,960
How come the baby doesn't grow up?

224
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,320
When doing the ultrasound check,

225
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
we saw that the baby was growing well,

226
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,480
as shown in the ultrasound photos.

227
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:10,679
It's okay.

228
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,560
Don't worry.

229
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
It's a bit early,

230
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,999
but it's going to be okay.

231
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,919
Then stay here with me.

232
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,999
I'm scared.

233
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,320
I'll stay with you.

234
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm not going anywhere.

235
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,120
And...

236
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,600
if something goes wrong

237
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,519
during labor,

238
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,200
you must choose to save me.

239
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,560
Xiongxiong can't live without me.

240
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,440
Don't prioritize saving the baby over me.

241
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,679
It's gonna be okay.

242
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I've got your back.

243
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,799
Fetal heartbeat's dropping.

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,679
Ma'am, please get out of here.

245
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,360
Excuse me, ma'am.

246
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,759
What?

247
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,360
We're going to check.

248
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
W- What's going on?

249
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,560
So, what's up with her?

250
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,360
Excuse me.

251
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,919
No.

252
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,240
Can't I just stay here with her?

253
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,399
No, we need to proceed with the check.

254
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,919
Meng'an, don't go.

255
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:47,639
No, no.

256
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,200
Easy does it, easy does it,

257
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,799
let's do the check first.

258
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,879
I'm at the door.

259
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm at the door.

260
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
You can spot me through the window.

261
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
Please take the check first.

262
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,879
What's wrong with me?

263
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,039
Mengxin, please take the check first.

264
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,879
I'm here for you.

265
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,039
What actually happened to me?

266
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,600
Take it easy.

267
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,320
What's happening?

268
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,200
What does that mean?

269
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,159
Okay, just relax.

270
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,759
Meng'an.

271
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,200
Haowen.

272
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Is everything okay with Mengxin?

273
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,320
She was doing okay just now,

274
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,320
but the fetal heartbeat dropped suddenly,

275
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,840
and medical staff rushed me out.

276
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,759
Mengxin,

277
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,999
Mengxin, I'm here for you.

278
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,840
Why is there an oxygen deficiency?

279
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,039
I'm going to put you on oxygen.

280
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,240
Take it easy.

281
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,759
The fetal heartbeat continues to drop,

282
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,919
and we're now preparing for a C-section.

283
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,399
No,

284
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,320
no,

285
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,519
why is this happening?

286
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,240
I don't want a C-section.

287
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,080
Go for it!

288
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,639
I don't want a C-section!

289
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,519
Shut up!

290
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,560
The fetus is at risk!

291
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,360
Why?

292
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,519
The fetal heartbeat is dropping.

293
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,039
We need to perform a C-section now.

294
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,519
Please sign the consent form.

295
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,519
Don't sign it!

296
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,240
Don't sign it!

297
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,759
Doctor,

298
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,960
doctor,

299
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,639
give me a little more time.

300
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,200
I- I can do a natural birth.

301
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,320
Trust me, okay?

302
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,840
Don't yell, don't yell.

303
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,360
You can handle a C-section.

304
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,240
You're a mom, aren't you?

305
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,840
Stay strong.

306
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,999
The baby will also do its best.

307
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:56,480
I previously had a natural birth.

308
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,519
They say the second one

309
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,560
will happen quickly and naturally.

310
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,240
Take it easy.

311
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,320
Give me a little more time.

312
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,840
I'll do it myself.

313
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,039
T- The second baby

314
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,679
will arrive soon.

315
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,759
The baby's heartbeat is dropping,

316
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,519
but don't worry.

317
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,240
The C-section procedures

318
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,159
are very advanced and safe.

319
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,159
Let's work together

320
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,560
as the baby is also cooperating, okay?

321
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,480
Meng'an,

322
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,639
Haowen, help me!

323
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,799
I don't want a C-section!

324
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,159
It is my wife's second delivery.

325
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,080
Her previous labor was fast.

326
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
Can we try for a natural birth?

327
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,279
Is a C-section necessary?

328
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,919
Yes, we must proceed with a C-section now.

329
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,720
Sign the consent form.

330
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,960
Haowen, don't sign it!

331
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,320
Don't sign it!

332
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
I'll kill you if you sign!

333
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,039
Haowen,

334
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,159
don't sign it!

335
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,720
I don't want a C-section!

336
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,159
Don't sign it!

337
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,519
Nowadays, C-section procedures

338
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,159
are highly advanced.

339
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't worry. It's a safe option.

340
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,639
Meng'an, you hear what she says.

341
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,440
She'll kill me if I sign it.

342
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,679
She can't even get out of bed.

343
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,879
How can she kill you?

344
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,840
Don't sign it.

345
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,480
I'll kill you if you do.

346
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,799
I can't sign it, Meng'an.

347
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,960
She always wants to

348
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,999
have the baby naturally.

349
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,480
I can't decide for her.

350
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,120
How about

351
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,440
I call Mom for advice?

352
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,720
Are you for real?

353
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,639
There's no time left.

354
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,919
Do you want to risk losing Mom and baby?

355
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,560
Why is that?

356
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,159
Why does Mengxin need a C-section

357
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,320
while I have to sign the consent form?

358
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,080
Don't sign it!

359
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,999
I'll kill you...

360
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,440
Here it is.

361
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,639
Thank you, doctor.

362
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,840
Xu Meng'an,

363
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Jia Haowen...

364
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm really stressed out.

365
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,120
It's tough to see you

366
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,840
going through so much pain.

367
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,840
Honey,

368
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,080
you've done so much for our family.

369
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,600
I can't imagine how your little body

370
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,919
bears with the C-section surgery.

371
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,720
Honey,

372
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,840
for the rest of my life,

373
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:27,999
I promise to

374
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,720
do anything you say.

375
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,159
No matter how you throw your tantrums,

376
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,840
I'll bear with it.

377
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,679
You're a real hero to our family.

378
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
I can't do anything without you.

379
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,440
Honey, please get well soon.

380
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,159
I'm feeling overwhelmed.

381
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,999
Honey.

382
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,159
Why are you crying?

383
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,440
Honey,

384
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,960
you're awake.

385
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,080
That's great, honey.

386
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,159
When you're better,

387
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,840
I'll take you on a trip.

388
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,080
We'll go on a big cruise.

389
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,320
We'll go wherever you want.

390
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,240
I want to show you all the cool places

391
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,039
you have yet to visit

392
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,999
to show you the most breathtaking scenery.

393
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:12,879
We can also do some shopping,

394
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
and you can choose whatever you like.

395
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,759
I will purchase whatever you want.

396
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,039
Honey,

397
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,919
you're so great.

398
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,840
Seriously,

399
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,720
you're a big hero to our family.

400
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,240
Honey, I mean it.

401
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,240
You've been through so much,

402
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,679
and we all,

403
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,759
including me,

404
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,679
are grateful to you

405
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,519
for our happy life.

406
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,320
Honey,

407
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,519
don't cry.

408
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,039
I always treated you like a princess,

409
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,639
but now I want to treat you like a queen,

410
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,480
like an empress.

411
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
You mean everything

412
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,799
to me and our two kids.

413
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,320
Honey,

414
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,399
from now on,

415
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,360
your wish is my command.

416
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,320
Seriously, I'm all yours.

417
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,039
I want to go to work.

418
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,960
No problem.

419
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,240
I remember you saying that you want to

420
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,440
work and pursue the chairman position.

421
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,919
I'm totally on board with that.

422
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,480
I'll be a stay-at-home dad,

423
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,480
cooking, making soup,

424
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,039
and seeing you after work every day.

425
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,360
Pen that down.

426
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,360
What?

427
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:09,240
Write down everything you just said.

428
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,879
Okay.

429
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,320
Let me know if there's anything else

430
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,600
you'd like me to commit to,

431
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,760
and I'll jot them all down.

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,639
Honey.

433
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,360
My wound hurts.

434
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,879
Boohoo...

435
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,080
I feel so bad for you, honey.

436
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,159
I brought Mom here.

437
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,679
She's looking after Mengxin.

438
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,360
How's the baby?

439
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't know.

440
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,439
We have to trust science.

441
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,040
I can't even see my daughter's face.

442
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,159
I'm not even sure if her eyes are open.

443
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,719
They say babies will resemble

444
00:17:58,719 --> 00:17:59,800
the first person they see.

445
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,520
How can you be sure

446
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,080
the first person the baby sees

447
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,320
is not Mengxin?

448
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,679
In the delivery room,

449
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,840
they always show the baby

450
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,919
to the mother first,

451
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,320
so the first person your daughter saw

452
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,199
could be the medical staff or Mengxin.

453
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,080
Meng'an, your words made me feel better.

454
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,120
The first person my daughter saw

455
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,280
must be her mom.

456
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,159
Keep an eye on your daughter.

457
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:23,679
Meng'an, please go home to get some rest.

458
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,360
You haven't slept well in two nights.

459
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm good.

460
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,479
Don't be ridiculous.

461
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,760
You're pregnant.

462
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,520
Life is so fragile.

463
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,600
We need to cherish it.

464
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,280
How about we go check out the baby?

465
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,000
Xin has

466
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,879
a boy and a girl now,

467
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,919
which is a good thing.

468
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,879
Yeah,

469
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:06,120
it's a good thing,

470
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,320
but Xin has gone through a lot of pain.

471
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,159
Congrats.

472
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,199
Thanks a lot.

473
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:19,879
See you around.

474
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,679
Come on, young ladies.

475
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,959
My daughter-in-law just had a baby girl.

476
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,120
I got some gifts for you both.

477
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,600
Congrats.

478
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,479
Congrats.

479
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,719
Thanks, thanks.

480
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
These treats

481
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,479
symbolize happiness.

482
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,679
Thank you all for taking care of Mengxin.

483
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:34,879
Thank you.

484
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,120
Hey, girls,

485
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,919
come over here

486
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,320
and grab these gifts.

487
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,520
I've got candies and red eggs for you.

488
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,520
I just became a grandma!

489
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
What a happy moment! Thanks!

490
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:44,439
Feel free to try some.

491
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,520
Don't be polite.

492
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,320
Sit still.

493
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,199
Mrs. Jia, how's it going?

494
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,199
Ah, Meng'an, you're here too.

495
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,239
Wow, what wonderful news!

496
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:53,120
Xin now has a son and a daughter.

497
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,679
Exactly, exactly.

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,479
Oh,

499
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,320
Xin's asleep now.

500
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,360
You know,

501
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,879
she's had a surgery,

502
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,040
so it's best we let her get some rest.

503
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,639
Yeah,

504
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm here to see the baby.

505
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,520
The baby's in the observation room.

506
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,600
Alright, I'll take a peek.

507
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,239
Go on.

508
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:08,840
Go and see your dear granddaughter.

509
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,399
Thanks for everything.

510
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,560
No problem at all.

511
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:11,239
Off you go.

512
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,280
Mrs. Jia is thrilled to

513
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,719
have a granddaughter.

514
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,760
Try to understand her feelings.

515
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,040
I can't relate.

516
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,879
I don't get

517
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,879
how she can be so happy

518
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,080
when Xin went through so much pain.

519
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,679
Having a C-section

520
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,800
is a

521
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,280
usual way of giving birth.

522
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,120
Xin wanted to have a natural delivery.

523
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
The C-section is tough on the body

524
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:57,399
and can be debilitating.

525
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,080
Come on.

526
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,439
I know you're worried about your daughter.

527
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,760
Why do you look

528
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,479
so pale?

529
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:17,560
You're always crying.

530
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,639
How can I look good?

531
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:22,560
Well,

532
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,280
you'd better go home and get some rest.

533
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,959
I'll stay here and keep an eye on Xin.

534
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:27,639
Are you sure you want to stay her

535
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,360
with that sad expression?

536
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,320
If she wakes up and sees you like this,

537
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,239
you'll both end up in tears.

538
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,320
Then I won't cry.

539
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,120
I won't cry.

540
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,479
Don't cry.

541
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,959
It's a good thing.

542
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:43,879
It's crucial that when Xin wakes up,

543
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,439
you greet her with a smile.

544
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,159
Come on, you can do it.

545
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,040
Okay, you can head home.

546
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,959
You stay here with her.

547
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,199
I'll check Dad first.

548
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:57,080
Take care.

549
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:58,520
I'll make sure to smile.

550
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,959
She looks so tiny

551
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,639
and delicate,

552
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,959
all fleshy,

553
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,239
pink,

554
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,800
and soft.

555
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,679
Like a doll.

556
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,040
To me, she looks like a caterpillar.

557
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,719
You know nothing,

558
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,120
kid.

559
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,679
Is this my little sister?

560
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:37,919
Could it be a mistake?

561
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,280
No way.

562
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,399
I've seen your baby pictures.

563
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,800
She looks just like you.

564
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:44,800
I look good.

565
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,280
That's how babies look.

566
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:49,439
No way.

567
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,879
I was definitely better looking than her.

568
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:55,959
Where is she?

569
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,320
Where is she?

570
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,959
Grandma.

571
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,040
Hi, Grandma.

572
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,439
Hi, grandson.

573
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,280
Mom, look!

574
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,840
Which one is she?

575
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,000
That one is your granddaughter.

576
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,120
She's so adorable,

577
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,040
with fair skin

578
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,600
and big eyes

579
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:09,840
like yours.

580
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Mom, her eyes don't look like mine.

581
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,879
They look like Xin's. Xinxin is beautiful.

582
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:13,639
She'd be plain if she looks like me.

583
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,120
She looks beautiful.

584
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,520
Do you think so, too?

585
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,280
Yeah.

586
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,080
You now have a son and a daughter. Great!

587
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,199
Your dad

588
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,439
would be happy

589
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,000
and bless you from above.

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Mom, you're so blessed.

591
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,439
I never thought

592
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,399
I'd have a little princess baby.

593
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,000
The whole family is so fortunate.

594
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,320
Have you picked a name yet?

595
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,840
No rush, Mom.

596
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,199
I'll come up with a good name later.

597
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,919
You know,

598
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,840
the more casual the name,

599
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
the better.

600
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,159
We used to call you Dark Blob,

601
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,199
and you didn't even have a proper name

602
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:46,159
until you started school.

603
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,000
But come on, Mom,

604
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,159
it's not that old of a time.

605
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,639
Dark Blob? Stop kidding.

606
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,560
How about letting Xiongxiong pick a name?

607
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,159
Xiongxiong,

608
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,760
your sister's so cute.

609
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,000
I bet you can pick a good name for her.

610
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,479
Me?

611
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,560
Mom, what a good name he could choose?

612
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,879
He's just a kid.

613
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:03,439
Yeah, he's only in first grade.

614
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:04,439
What if he picks a name

615
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:05,760
like Ultraman?

616
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,919
I won't. Anyway, she's my sister.

617
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,159
I already have a name for her.

618
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:09,959
I want to call her

619
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,320
Little Watermelon.

620
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,239
That's adorable.

621
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:12,560
Little Watermelon.

622
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,760
I think this name isn't a good choice.

623
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,600
Watermelon is sweet

624
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,120
and pink,

625
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,520
and it would be adorable to

626
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:20,159
nickname a girl Little Watermelon.

627
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,239
Great!

628
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,959
Xiongxiong, you've done a great job

629
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,800
naming your sister.

630
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,159
After counting down from three to one,

631
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,320
let's say Little Watermelon.

632
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,560
Okay, keep the voice lower.

633
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,000
Three, two, one.

634
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,800
Little Watermelon.

635
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,840
Hello, Mr. Li.

636
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,879
How's your day?

637
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,879
It's me, Zhou.

638
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,000
Did you check out

639
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,840
the financial product

640
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,639
I sent you last time?

641
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,399
Our real estate company

642
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:46,919
is super secure and much more reliable

643
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,080
than those smaller finance companies.

644
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,919
We invest in these products ourselves,

645
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,879
so you can trust that they're reliable.

646
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,399
Feel confident when you buy products

647
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:53,479
from our Huaxing Real Estate Co.

648
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,800
Looks like everyone's quite busy today.

649
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,360
Are the pre-sale results looking good

650
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,800
for your first client surveys?

651
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,679
On my end,

652
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:01,600
several clients have

653
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,479
shown strong interest in our product.

654
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,120
Right.

655
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,840
Selling a house

656
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,159
can take a long time to close a deal

657
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,000
because people don't buy houses often.

658
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,239
But selling financial products

659
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,280
is a whole different ball game.

660
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,760
It seems like everyone

661
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,959
did well in today's pre-sale.

662
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,399
Keep up the good work.

663
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,120
Unfortunately,

664
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
someone has a ton of

665
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,000
high-quality clients.

666
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
But she can't even

667
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,919
close a single financial deal.

668
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,639
Well, you all get back to work now.

669
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,479
You, come here with me.

670
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:41,919
Chen Wanzhen,

671
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,439
look at everyone else

672
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,879
working hard to make sales,

673
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,199
and you're not even making a phone call.

674
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:46,879
Is it appropriate for you to do that?

675
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,239
Don't you want to

676
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,360
increase your paycheck?

677
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,080
I'm trying to help you.

678
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,159
I understand, Mr. Qian. Thanks.

679
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:55,959
Actually,

680
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,919
I'm investing in a securities

681
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,520
training course out of my own pocket.

682
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,040
I believe that once I

683
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,520
have a better grasp of this area,

684
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll find it easier to

685
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,800
sell financial products later.

686
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,639
Come on, Chen Wanzhen.

687
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,040
Don't try to

688
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,719
fool me.

689
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:09,679
You have a degree

690
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,520
associated with this field,

691
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,800
so why are you still undergoing training?

692
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,000
To be honest,

693
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,879
I don't want to sell financial products.

694
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,760
Because I believe

695
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,000
this practice

696
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,800
wastes my clients' resources

697
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
and is irresponsible.

698
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,120
Wanzhen,

699
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,360
it's great that

700
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:26,199
you prioritize your clients' interests.

701
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,479
However, it's also essential to

702
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,360
strengthen your relationships with them.

703
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:31,679
How about

704
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,719
organizing another social event

705
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,560
and inviting all your clients?

706
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,959
We can use this opportunity to

707
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:37,439
casually introduce

708
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,719
our company's financial products

709
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,199
without making the gathering too formal.

710
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,919
It will also improve

711
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,120
your connection with your clients.

712
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,199
Is that okay with you?

713
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:46,520
No.

714
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:54,560
There you are.

715
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,280
How's Dad?

716
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,399
How's Dad?

717
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,080
Today, he was able to

718
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,120
move arms and legs.

719
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:05,600
The doctor said

720
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,080
that's the best thing that could happen.

721
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,719
He'll recover slowly

722
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,000
and do rehab

723
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,719
until the blood in his brain

724
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:14,320
clears up.

725
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,399
There won't be any after-effects,

726
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:18,000
but the main thing is to

727
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,959
prevent a second stroke.

728
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:20,760
Good.

729
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,679
How are you today?

730
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,439
I'm good.

731
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,600
Come over here and take a seat.

732
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:25,639
I'm not sitting down.

733
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,199
Come outside with me.

734
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,320
I need to talk to you about something.

735
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:49,520
Listen,

736
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:52,080
I've been thinking about it

737
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,879
and decided to

738
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,280
have the baby

739
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,360
as long as my body allows.

740
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:11,760
Honey,

741
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,520
are you making

742
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,000
this decision

743
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,959
to encourage Dad?

744
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,959
Not really.

745
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,479
I see that

746
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,080
there's nothing that we can't overcome

747
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,760
in Dad.

748
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,439
Yeah,

749
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:47,280
as long as we stick together

750
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,320
as a family,

751
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,800
there's nothing

752
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,879
we can't get through.

753
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,639
But having this baby

754
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:59,159
might come with

755
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,360
a hefty price tag.

756
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,679
My health,

757
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,040
my job,

758
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
how we raise this child

759
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,399
in the future,

760
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,159
our overall quality of life,

761
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,399
and our standard of living

762
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,080
could all be impacted.

763
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,879
But since

764
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,280
we are a family,

765
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,879
we can handle challenges together.

766
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
This little one

767
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
didn't come into our lives

768
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
because we're better off.

769
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:29,520
We can't just

770
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,679
abandon him

771
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,000
because of that.

772
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,360
They all say that a child

773
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,280
can thrive no matter how you raise them,

774
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,919
so I think that

775
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,600
if,

776
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,120
and I mean if,

777
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,959
the problems

778
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:49,719
we've been worried about

779
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,000
really happen,

780
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,520
we can sell

781
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,199
the new house we bought

782
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,320
and live together

783
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,280
in the current one.

784
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,080
But as long as we're happy,

785
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,000
the life

786
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,399
is sweet.

787
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
Do you think so?

788
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,120
Yes.

789
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,080
Let's bear the burden together.

790
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,399
Sure.

791
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:53,959
Mom.

792
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,879
I'm here,

793
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,439
Xin.

794
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,479
The wound hurts.

795
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,520
I'm in pain.

796
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,199
You've endured so much.

797
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,239
It hurts.

798
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,560
I know. I know it.

799
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,760
Hugs for you.

800
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:17,719
Mom.

801
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,719
Lin,

802
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:31,239
I'm so happy.

803
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,840
I've become a father once again.

804
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,479
I have a daughter.

805
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,159
Congrats!

806
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,399
Thanks, Lin!

807
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:37,840
Thanks!

808
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,520
Are those red eggs and candies?

809
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,760
Yes, they are.

810
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,520
Let me try some.

811
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,600
My mom prepared them. Go ahead.

812
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,000
Thank you.

813
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,760
Help yourself.

814
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,719
Lin, you know what?

815
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,399
Holding my chubby son in my arms

816
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,280
as a dad for the first time didn't

817
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,560
bring me as much joy as it does now.

818
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,040
My daughter is the sweetest,

819
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,399
born with fair skin and cute chubbiness.

820
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,760
She has these big, beautiful eyes

821
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,360
and looks exactly

822
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,959
like Xin.

823
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:56,159
She's a carbon copy of her mother.

824
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,159
Even the nurses couldn't help

825
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,959
but comment on how gorgeous she was.

826
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,520
Lin,

827
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:01,560
Lin,

828
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,120
why are you even more excited than I am?

829
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:03,959
Lin?

830
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:05,199
Haowen,

831
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,919
get ready to enjoy

832
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,919
the treats I'll bring over to celebrate.

833
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,000
What do you mean?

834
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,800
An and I have made the final decision.

835
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,919
We've decided to keep the baby.

836
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,919
Wait, wait.

837
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,360
Shouldn't we have a big hug to celebrate?

838
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,919
Hold on.

839
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,000
Give me one moment.

840
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,439
Let me think about it.

841
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:25,439
Let me think about it.

842
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,399
Why do you need to think about that?

843
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,040
Do you

844
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,919
have a say in your family's stuff?

845
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,719
Of course, I have a say.

846
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,919
What's on your mind?

847
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,479
Your family's decisions constantly change.

848
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,760
Is everything set in stone?

849
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:39,560
It's final.

850
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:42,919
Lin,

851
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,639
listen,

852
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,399
you should be like me

853
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,239
and have a daughter.

854
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,280
Wait, Lin,

855
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,919
your family already has a daughter.

856
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:52,639
You must have a son this time.

857
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,239
Girl and boy,

858
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:54,840
Lin,

859
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,280
double joy.

860
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,000
Double joy.

861
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,040
Well, chill.

862
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,719
We've made our decision.

863
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:06,399
But

864
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,800
But let's keep it down low for now.

865
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,840
Meng'an needs to

866
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,800
care for herself

867
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:11,560
and the baby,

868
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,959
so let's not spill the beans, okay?

869
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,919
Wait,

870
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,520
will you two change your minds?

871
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,799
Don't stress.

872
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:22,679
The decision is final.

873
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,679
We're going to make this work.

874
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,960
Make this work.

875
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,799
Make this work.

876
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:35,960
I can't believe it, Lin.

877
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,880
Girl and boy...

878
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,440
Please lower your voice.

879
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,560
You're outside the ward rooms.

880
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,759
Girl and boy,

881
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,520
double joy.

882
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,560
Double joy.

883
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,239
I'm so happy.

884
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,520
Let's pick it up.

885
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,000
Yunjie.

886
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:20,560
Yunjie.

887
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,400
Why aren't you in bed yet?

888
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
I'm waiting for you two.

889
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,359
I want to talk to you.

890
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,560
Take a seat.

891
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:32,799
Sit here.

892
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,719
What do you want to talk to us about?

893
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,560
Dad, you go first.

894
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,239
What should I say first?

895
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,199
We already talked about that.

896
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,120
You know,

897
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,759
it's that thing.

898
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,839
I smell a plot.

899
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,440
No way,

900
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,080
there's no plot.

901
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,839
I don't say it, you say it yourself.

902
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,679
Dad,

903
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,359
I can't believe you!

904
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,920
Fine, I'll just say it.

905
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,159
Mom,

906
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,120
you should keep the baby

907
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,639
because I really want a little sister.

908
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:16,040
Dad's on my side too,

909
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,199
but he dares not say anything.

910
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,239
I don't care.

911
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:19,359
I'm your daughter,

912
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,719
and you can't stop me.

913
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,120
Now the ball's in your court,

914
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
so let's see what you do.

915
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,920
I've said my piece.

916
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,279
You've got some nerve.

917
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,239
You dare to talk to me like that.

918
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,600
I'm part of this family.

919
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,359
This baby

920
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,799
will be my sister.

921
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:36,359
I need to

922
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,440
make my point.

923
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:39,880
Why do you think the baby

924
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,319
I'm expecting is a girl?

925
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:42,560
It just has to be a girl, that's it.

926
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,639
But what if it ends up being a boy?

927
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:44,719
No way.

928
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,920
What's your take on it?

929
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:48,600
Well, for me,

930
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,359
I'm okay with either a boy or a girl.

931
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Mom, I really want a sister.

932
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,400
Today,

933
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,719
I saw Xiongxiong's little sister.

934
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,600
She looked so adorable and light-skinned,

935
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:09,639
and my heart melted once I saw her.

936
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,639
Mom,

937
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:12,159
please keep the baby.

938
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,319
I can't get

939
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,000
why you're so eager to

940
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,480
have a sister.

941
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,880
It's because I am her big sister.

942
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,199
We share a telepathic bond.

943
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,319
You're my child,

944
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:23,199
so why can't you use that telepathic bond

945
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,480
to tell me if I'm going to keep the baby?

946
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,960
You'll keep the baby,

947
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,440
will you?

948
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,520
I'm the one who is expecting the baby.

949
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,639
Why are you asking your dad?

950
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:30,480
I promise

951
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,920
I'll act mature from now on

952
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,880
and won't get you in trouble.

953
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,960
You act too mature.

954
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:41,440
Listen,

955
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,600
about having a second child,

956
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:47,520
I personally

957
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,719
want to have one.

958
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,560
But I've always been

959
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,120
unable to do so.

960
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,839
Lately, we have experienced a lot.

961
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,960
Luckily, they have

962
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,159
taken a turn

963
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,040
for the better.

964
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,719
Your grandpa has regained consciousness,

965
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,920
and your aunt has had her second child.

966
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,639
I've always felt that

967
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,159
this baby

968
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,319
is meant to

969
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,520
be a part

970
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,600
of our family.

971
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,639
So what's holding you back? Let's keep it.

972
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,880
Are you sure?

973
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,600
Yes.

974
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:18,960
Alright,

975
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,719
let's keep the baby.

976
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,440
Mom, I love you!

977
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,440
Be careful.

978
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,080
Your mom's pregnant.

979
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,719
Little Grape, my bad.

980
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,359
I didn't mean it.

981
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:34,120
My dear sister!

982
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,359
Dad, is Mom still sleeping?

983
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,960
Your mom's been exhausted these two days.

984
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Let her get some more sleep.

985
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,920
Okay.

986
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,799
Who's there?

987
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,040
Jing,

988
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,359
what brings you here?

989
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Why can't I be here?

990
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,239
Where's Mong'an?

991
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,440
She's sleeping.

992
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,920
Let her get some rest.

993
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:45,400
Auntie,

994
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,560
did you know my mom is pregnant?

995
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,600
Yeah,

996
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,400
that's excellent news.

997
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,159
I should be there, shouldn't I?

998
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,719
If your aunt gets wind of any news,

999
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,520
the whole world will know about it.

1000
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,639
It's fine if the whole world finds out.

1001
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,319
But she'll scold

1002
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,719
and lecture us

1003
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,040
and take charge.

1004
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,759
Go inside and brush your teeth.

1005
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,000
Jing,

1006
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,080
I mean,

1007
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:15,920
you should have informed me

1008
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,120
so I could have picked you up.

1009
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,639
It's fine.

1010
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,440
The morning bus is less crowded.

1011
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,400
Okay,

1012
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,080
I'll go wake up Mong'an.

1013
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,159
Let her get a little more sleep.

1014
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,159
J-

1015
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,920
Jing...

1016
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,719
Li Lin,

1017
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
your father-in-law had a stroke,

1018
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,719
your sister-in-law had premature birth.

1019
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,679
Why didn't you tell me about

1020
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,960
the big things that happened?

1021
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,080
Jing,

1022
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,920
it's none of your business.

1023
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:49,639
She...

1024
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,960
it's about Meng'an's family.

1025
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:55,600
We're family, aren't we?

1026
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:56,839
Meng'an's family issues

1027
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:58,319
are also my concern.

1028
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,080
Families are supposed to

1029
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,319
help each other.

1030
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,359
Do you still consider me as your sister?

1031
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:04,319
Yes, of course,

1032
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,600
we do.

1033
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,319
Please don't be upset.

1034
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,319
We had plenty of help on hand,

1035
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,400
so we didn't feel the need to bother you.

1036
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,400
Furthermore,

1037
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:14,639
you have to look after

1038
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,000
your husband.

1039
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,520
Why do I need to look after him?

1040
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,639
I want to take care of you.

1041
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,759
You're pregnant,

1042
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,839
so let me lend you a hand

1043
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,920
so you can take a break.

1044
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,319
Our family matters all settled in now.

1045
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,279
My father has been

1046
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,400
moved to the general ward.

1047
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,719
Xin has given birth and will be going to

1048
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,759
the care center in two days.

1049
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,799
Thanks to Lanxiang,

1050
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:41,799
we've managed to stabilize.

1051
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,759
You're so kind to send her to help us.

1052
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,359
I really appreciate it, Jing.

1053
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:46,880
Come on,

1054
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:48,759
don't mention it.

1055
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,880
Lanxiang briefed me on the situation.

1056
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:51,960
The three of you

1057
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,759
are taking turns

1058
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,359
to look after your dad now, aren't you?

1059
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,359
Now I'm here. You can take a break.

1060
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:00,279
I will take care of your dad

1061
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:00,920
in your place, okay?

1062
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,440
What...

1063
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,520
What about your husband?

1064
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,080
Why should I worry about him?

1065
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,639
He's got his apprentice to look after him.

1066
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You're the most important one

1067
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,400
in our family now.

1068
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,400
I'll make sure to take good care of you.

1069
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,440
Don't worry. I've taught Lanxiang

1070
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,920
how to care for patients.

1071
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm sure that I'll do better than her.

1072
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:23,719
Sure thing.

1073
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:26,480
Meng'an,

1074
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,560
I heard from Lanxiang that

1075
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,679
you've had prenatal care for a while.

1076
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,960
Yeah.

1077
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,440
Come on.

1078
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,279
Guess what I brought you?

1079
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,480
She can't take medication, Jing.

1080
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:44,960
What do you know?

1081
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,960
Who said it's medicine?

1082
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,759
It's nutrition.

1083
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,359
It was your grandfather's secret recipe.

1084
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,239
It's what you drank

1085
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,159
when you were pregnant with Yunjie.

1086
00:42:58,799 --> 00:42:59,920
My husband made it

1087
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,239
with great care.

1088
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
I boiled it all night

1089
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,759
last night.

1090
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,520
Let me heat a packet

1091
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,600
for you right now.

1092
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,679
Drinking it can

1093
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,719
reduce stress and protect the fetus.

1094
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,480
H- H-

1095
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,120
Help!

1096
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,719
Run!
