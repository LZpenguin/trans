1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,900
Just in Time EP08

3
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,359
Then.

4
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,320
Give me a glass of similar one.

5
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,439
Pour a glass to Mr. Yu.

6
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,439
Give a try of my stock.

7
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,160
Okay.

8
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:06,439
Thanks.

9
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:06,919
It smells good.

10
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,839
If that's how you drink it.

11
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
Then give him something else.

12
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,040
Hit me another drink.

13
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,439
Okay.

14
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,880
Zhou Yao, I just want to ask you.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Why?

16
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,879
Why does your Yaohui Co.

17
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,640
not invest in

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,480
my Blue Ocean Media?

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,719
For a lot reasons.

20
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,039
But I'm not the only one

21
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,680
who can call the shots.

22
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,039
My Blue Ocean Media

23
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,120
is top-notch locally.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,599
My business is top 1 of the field.

25
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,319
Isn't that right?

26
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,520
Why did you not invest?

27
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:40,920
We invest in the future,

28
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,960
the trend,

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,159
but not present.

30
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,120
Now your Blue Ocean Media is the top.

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,960
What about tomorrow?

32
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,879
Will it be No.1, too?

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,039
I give you my word.

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,439
My Blue Ocean Media

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,800
was,

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,960
is,

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,839
and will be

38
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,680
always the top 1.

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,400
As long as your Yaohui Co.

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,999
recognizes me,

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
my company can make transition.

42
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,200
In the future, I'll still be on top.

43
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,360
Mr. Yu.

44
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,319
We don't talk about business after work.

45
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,839
Only drink, okay?

46
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:12,640
Fine.

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,439
You're not willing to invest in my company anyway.

48
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,480
Isn't that right?

49
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,240
It's Okay. It's Okay.

50
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:19,800
Thank you.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,559
Ms. Zhang.

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,920
How'd the talk go

53
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,319
with the lawyer of Yu Hai.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,080
Mr. Yu

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,839
has no objection to division of property.

56
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,800
But he wants custody too.

57
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,759
Yet you're the mother.

58
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,039
You will have advantages.

59
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,080
Besides, I'd like to try

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,800
to have discussions

61
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,599
with him.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,039
Then should I go further

63
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,839
to prove my financial capacity?

64
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,080
If Yu Hai

65
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,839
are not willing to give up custody,

66
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
I would argue

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
that Yu Hai and you

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,319
started the business together.

69
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,360
Stock rights of the company should be equally divided.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
Then, we should prepare for

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,879
the lawsuit.

72
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:03,599
Mom.

73
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,439
I need to go to the bathroom.

74
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,240
Okay.

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,999
Ms. Zhang, please wait a minute.

76
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,319
Come, I'll take you there.

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,439
Mr. Yu.

78
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,120
If drinking is not for

79
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,599
enjoyment and fun,

80
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,039
but for dullness,

81
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,520
then we'd better go home and sleep.

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
Take a rest.

83
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,680
You can't drown your sorrows in alcohol.

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,879
Yes, I should go home.

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,360
With you, a bachelor,

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,999
what can I talk?

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,920
You're right.

88
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,319
I'm single.

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,879
But there are two types of bachelors.

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,040
There's one that

91
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
has unrequited love.

92
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,439
The other type, however,

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,639
just has so many admirers

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,079
that he wants none.

95
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,519
We call him

96
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,720
eligible bachelor,

97
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,439
or golden bachelor.

98
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,399
No, this...

99
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,759
What's the differences?

100
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,519
What eligible bachelor?

101
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,519
I think there are differences.

102
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,920
You're a golden bachelor?

103
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,319
Where's the gold?

104
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,639
Where?

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,240
Is your hair gold?

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
Or the ears?

107
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,040
Or the nose?

108
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,920
To be honest,

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,680
you don't have a wife

110
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,040
nor a child,

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,800
and will go to the nursing home

112
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,319
as a lonely old man.

113
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,319
Right?

114
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,240
In another twenty years,

115
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,319
if no one comes to the nursing home

116
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,399
to see you

117
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,720
and visit you...

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,879
You're drunk.

119
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,360
Am I right?

120
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,240
I'm leaving.

121
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,160
Send Mr. Yu home.

122
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,840
Wait...

123
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,720
Mr. Zhou.

124
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,280
-Wait, -What are you doing?

125
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,199
Mr. Zhou, listen to me.

126
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,800
Listen.

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I talk too much today.

128
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,559
I'm begging you.

129
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,360
Begging you to look

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
at our proposal

131
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,439
and my plan. Okay?

132
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,079
You're drunk.

133
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,559
No, my..

134
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,199
Blue Ocean...ten years ago...

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
grew wildly

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,959
ten years ago.

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,959
But if...

138
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,959
I have your funding.

139
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I promise...

140
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,639
No, no, trust me.

141
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,600
Can you trust me?

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm a

143
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,439
decent media professional.

144
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,720
I have a media dream.

145
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Alright?

146
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,079
For my business,

147
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,800
I've been working so hard for over ten years.

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,519
For it

149
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,800
I've put everything I had.

150
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,280
But now I...

151
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
I lost

152
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,519
my wife and kids.

153
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,240
You trust me.

154
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,800
I absolutely

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
would not fail your funding.

156
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,959
Alright?

157
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,319
Some other day.

158
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,319
No, no, no.

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,800
We must add WeChat.

160
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,720
Add a contact, okay?

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,280
Add a contact.

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,519
I send my proposal to you.

163
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,720
Okay? We add a WeChat.

164
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,360
Add a WeChat, alright?

165
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,280
Wait.

166
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,399
Let's add a contact.

167
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,519
Is this your wife?

168
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:29,840
Yes.

169
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,519
Now she is my wife.

170
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,600
Not sure for the future.

171
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,399
Here, add a WeChat,

172
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,240
okay?

173
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,800
I send my proposal to you.

174
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,040
Fine, we add a WeChat.

175
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,439
Okay.

176
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:47,959
Okay, scanned it.

177
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,199
I'm sending to you now.

178
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,600
I...

179
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,800
Look.

180
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
How lovely my daughters are.

181
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
You can't be single.

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,079
Marry and have children.

183
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,959
Have two daughters.

184
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,800
So adorable.

185
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm sending my proposal to you.

186
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
Have a good rest.

187
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,199
Are you okay?

188
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,720
I...

189
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,160
Mom.

190
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,959
Will I see

191
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,199
daddy again?

192
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,240
Of course.

193
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,399
Mom promises you.

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,720
Every week in the future,

195
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,360
you can see daddy, alright?

196
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,959
Be my girl. And go to sleep.

197
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
Cover yourself well.

198
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,300
Excuse me, Ms. Zhang.

199
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,940
I was thinking

200
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,160
we'd better

201
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,800
negotiate a solution with them,

202
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,519
better not go to court.

203
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,199
I hope the kids can get

204
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,360
maximum protection.

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,319
Yes.

206
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,879
Wanzhen, you really are

207
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,120
the most rational person

208
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
I've ever seen in a divorce dispute.

209
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:24,519
Am I?

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,680
Since I'm not for

211
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,879
a fit of pique to divorce,

212
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,399
but for a better future,

213
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,120
right?

214
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,680
Wanzhen,

215
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,439
now that you've chosen this,

216
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,999
there must be much trouble

217
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:34,999
that follows.

218
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:36,800
I will be on your side.

219
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,240
For anything you need,

220
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,399
I will surely help you.

221
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,959
Thanks for the trouble, Ms. Zhang.

222
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,600
Thanks.

223
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,360
Goodbye.

224
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,360
Goodbye.

225
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,080
Mr. Yu.

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,480
The supplementary materials of Blue Ocean,

227
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,200
please provide.

228
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,399
Morning, Mr. Zhou.

229
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,639
Mr. Yu.

230
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,159
Here, the materials you asked.

231
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
You're right last night.

232
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
No, I...last night,

233
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,320
talked too much.

234
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,399
Don't take it seriously.

235
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,720
Which one?

236
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,799
Investing in Blue Ocean,

237
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,159
or saying I'm a bachelor?

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,440
I...I meant investing in Blue Ocean

239
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,919
is well worth it.

240
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
The other one, you forget about it.

241
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,919
I was in a bad mood,

242
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,799
so I was frivolous.

243
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,360
You are too old to have love concerns.

244
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,200
Let me see if you

245
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
almost are a bachelor, too?

246
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,720
Let me do it.

247
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,200
Keep in touch on the phone.

248
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,120
Are you going to interview?

249
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Mei Yiduo told me that

250
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,639
the senior,

251
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,600
dean Ma -

252
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,519
His college has a laboratory

253
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,120
just needing a position

254
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,840
for technical maintenance.

255
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,360
So we have an appointment today

256
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,720
to talk.

257
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,159
What's wrong?

258
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,399
I want to give you

259
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,560
all my good luck today.

260
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,159
Just today?

261
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,159
I haven't got the tomorrow's yet.

262
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
What are you doing?

263
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
I'm still here.

264
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,639
I just feel your dad

265
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,639
pretty handsome today.

266
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,799
What's the matter of a hug?

267
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,799
Yunjie...

268
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,360
What are you doing?

269
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
What's going on?

270
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,840
Let go.

271
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,519
Let him go.

272
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,960
I also think my dad handsome.

273
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,360
What's wrong with my hug?

274
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
He's my husband.

275
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
He's my dad.

276
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,279
Daddy.

277
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,320
We are on the second in this bid.

278
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,360
The first one

279
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,759
is not a local company.

280
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,919
I don't know much about it,

281
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,080
and have asked people to find their information.

282
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,840
It's okay.

283
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,519
It happens.

284
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,919
We can win a bid,

285
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,200
which is already pretty good.

286
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,320
Finish the job on hand.

287
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,999
The Yu Hai of Blue Ocean.

288
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,799
He should know this project.

289
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
Why didn't he come?

290
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
I feel weird, too.

291
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
Logically speaking,

292
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,320
Blue Ocean is kind of

293
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,560
a leading enterprise.

294
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
They didn't attend...

295
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Do you think

296
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:37,999
they have known better

297
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,200
that they would not win the bid.

298
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,360
Therefore,

299
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,679
they didn't attend.

300
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,600
What's wrong?

301
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,399
Are you finding excuses for yourself?

302
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,279
No, no, definitely not.

303
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,159
I am careful with

304
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,360
each project.

305
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,919
You should know it well.

306
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,879
I know, I know.

307
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,440
I heard Yu Hai

308
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
and the director Huang

309
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,120
of his company

310
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,480
have been discussed a lot

311
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,799
in the city.

312
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,799
You were fellow students; did you know that?

313
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,919
I...

314
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,200
I've been busy

315
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
with the biding lately,

316
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,919
and I didn't know much about it.

317
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,120
Haven't you said you want to take the annual vacation?

318
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,519
I was meant to say it.

319
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,200
It's okay.

320
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,879
I've approved.

321
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,600
These days,

322
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,679
the content department

323
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
in the company

324
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
has a lot of things

325
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,879
needing your management.

326
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,039
You don't even have any help.

327
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,080
It was exhausting.

328
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,120
Just hang out

329
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,399
and relax yourself.

330
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,159
I 'll arrange well the work

331
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,039
at hand.

332
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,200
Good.

333
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,200
There must be something wrong behind it.

334
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,039
You know

335
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,840
why did he approve

336
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,200
the vacation so quickly?

337
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
There's something behind it?

338
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,999
He asked me to find headhunters

339
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,320
to look for a vice director.

340
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,320
And asked me to arrange

341
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,600
a new round of interview.

342
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,960
How can't do these,

343
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,200
if he doesn't send you away.

344
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,480
Can't you promote

345
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,360
Mu?

346
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,200
He's been working with me for over 3 years.

347
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,399
I'm sure

348
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,519
his ability is fine.

349
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,360
You talk to him first then.

350
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,080
I can put him in

351
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,759
the list of personnel evaluation,

352
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,120
but this thing

353
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,560
is still up to Mr. Zhang.

354
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,200
What if the boss believes

355
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,120
people from the outside

356
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,240
perform better?

357
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,960
You're right.

358
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,039
Ms. Lan is the one

359
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,960
he found from outside

360
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,360
to balance me.

361
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,600
Right.

362
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,200
But those people

363
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,960
just know how to talk with Mr. Zhang.

364
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,440
They eventually left.

365
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,759
The real core of the company

366
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:36,960
is you.

367
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,720
That's what they call strength.

368
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,840
No, no, no. I mostly rely on you

369
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,279
for offering news.

370
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
No, no, no,

371
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,679
If the company does not

372
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,120
have the support of content department,

373
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,360
no matter how great administrative department is,

374
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,159
it would be useless.

375
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,879
Without the effective management of administrative,

376
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,600
the content department can't grow either.

377
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,399
This boasting talk

378
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,039
is literally

379
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,799
pressure relieving.

380
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,999
Then I go on.

381
00:15:59,519 --> 00:15:59,960
No need.

382
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,600
Don't worry,

383
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,560
I'll help you for sure.

384
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
In case you want to have a baby again.

385
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,600
I've taken my leave.

386
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
I mean the next time.

387
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,799
Think about it.

388
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,200
Having a baby

389
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,120
should take a year or so.

390
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,519
The vice director must come from inside.

391
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Have a baby as early as possible maybe.

392
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,480
This time it is.

393
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,759
Haven't you started menopause in advance?

394
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
After this birth,

395
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,960
you still can recover,

396
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,440
and make it to fifty years old.

397
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,879
Thanks a lot for your advice.

398
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,560
You're welcome,

399
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,440
I mean it.

400
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,600
Delaying climacteric

401
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
is worth considering,

402
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,679
which has much to do

403
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,919
with the quality of life.

404
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,600
Get out.

405
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:42,600
Okay.

406
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,320
My life quality is fine.

407
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,200
Mu,

408
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,320
come over here.

409
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,320
Did you know

410
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,080
why Haoze's mom

411
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,840
was kicked out suddenly

412
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,960
by her husband?

413
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,080
Save a place

414
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,960
for the next woman.

415
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,759
No, no, no.

416
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,919
That's because

417
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,840
the affair between her and that fitness coach

418
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,279
was caught by her husband.

419
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,720
Really?

420
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,879
She even told us

421
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:16,560
that we should cultivate our spirit.

422
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,040
Turns out she is the one indiscreet.

423
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't say that.

424
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,919
Her husband is much so.

425
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,560
He even had a child

426
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,639
with the other woman.

427
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:24,959
Why don't you talk about her husband?

428
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,959
Men and women are different.

429
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,959
That's right.

430
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,360
What age is it now?

431
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,600
You are having double standards.

432
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,639
Here, have some snacks.

433
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:38,679
Here, have some snacks.

434
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:40,639
This one

435
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,199
is good.

436
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:52,439
Take your time.

437
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,560
I have to go.

438
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,320
It has been 3 years since I was in the company.

439
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,199
How do you think of your performance?

440
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,959
I've never been late or left early.

441
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,719
I'm willing to work overtime,

442
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,800
and enjoy working here.

443
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,040
Then what?

444
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Then...

445
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:19,320
Director Xu,

446
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,360
what do you want me to do?

447
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,439
What your plan

448
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,600
of your own occupation?

449
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:30,639
I have not.

450
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,600
I...I just want to do my best

451
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,199
to finish every job today.

452
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,600
Mu.

453
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,239
We can't just be like this.

454
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,360
We should have plan in workplace.

455
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,959
You gotta know what kind of things to do

456
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:54,840
at what time,

457
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,000
what kind of position to take,

458
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,840
and what kind of opportunities to grasp

459
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,239
at what time.

460
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,439
All these have to be planned.

461
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,199
Do you understand?

462
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,280
I do.

463
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:05,800
Want a promotion?

464
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,600
Want a pay raise?

465
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,399
Of course.

466
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:09,919
Then you should mention it.

467
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,679
Mention...

468
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,959
Our company just laid off some people.

469
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:21,959
The content department has just been integrated,

470
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,199
so the deputy director has been vacant.

471
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,919
Why didn't you bring it up?

472
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,479
You're now kind of

473
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:29,120
a senior in the company.

474
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,600
You can bring it up.

475
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,439
How should I do?

476
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,080
Soldier's quality reflects

477
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,040
the general's.

478
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,919
Listen to me.

479
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:42,959
First,

480
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
write an application of promotion.

481
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,560
hand it over to HR.

482
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,639
Put

483
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,199
your past work achievements,

484
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,120
and the outlook

485
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,399
to your future.

486
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,199
Second,

487
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,360
you need to make efforts to show yourself lately,

488
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,959
try not to make mistakes,

489
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,320
and strive to do more,

490
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,399
alright?

491
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:01,959
Okay.

492
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:10,639
I'm bringing it up now.

493
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,199
Go head.

494
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,199
Thank you, director Xu.

495
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,600
Is this how promotion talk looks like?

496
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,360
Hi, Mengxin.

497
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,399
Sister,

498
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,000
I've sent you a pin on your phone.

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,560
Check it.

500
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,360
You...you...you...

501
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,239
you run to that place right now,

502
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,199
hurry up.

503
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,959
I'm telling you...

504
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,560
Haowen...

505
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:37,199
Haowen...

506
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,760
Haowen has cheated on me!

507
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,199
He has cheated on you?

508
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,479
Are you drunk?

509
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:41,760
Are you drunk?

510
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,199
How's that impossible? I've shot it.

511
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:43,600
No..

512
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,639
no..

513
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:45,639
not me who shot it,

514
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:46,360
but the paparazzi I asked shot it.

515
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,560
The paparazzi have caught it!

516
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,479
What?

517
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,959
Why am I here?

518
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,840
I was working, you know that?

519
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,280
Haowen has cheated on me.

520
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,399
I'm going to divorce.

521
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,239
Then, go.

522
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,320
What are you going?

523
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,239
Bust them.

524
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,159
Wait.. you, you...

525
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,919
you don't rush to stand up for me yet.

526
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,760
I'm not unreasonable.

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,959
Look, I have proof.

528
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:14,760
See.

529
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,239
He's having coffee with this woman.

530
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,040
You see, they're touching.

531
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,199
People make friends, right?

532
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,239
She's not a friend.

533
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,239
She's an influencer.

534
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
So he can't make friend with an influencer?

535
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,959
He can,

536
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,639
but why

537
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:28,479
in the hotel?

538
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,399
And going straight upstairs

539
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:30,080
after finishing coffee.

540
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,840
What can it be?

541
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,760
They must've booked a room in there.

542
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,199
So what are you waiting for?

543
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Hurry up,

544
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,520
more nagging,

545
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
they'd finish.

546
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,719
Then how could you bust them in bed?

547
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
You don't say.

548
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,360
In the room,

549
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,439
maybe they're talking business.

550
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:47,399
Then why did you call me here?

551
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,520
I'm scared.

552
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,600
You see...

553
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He's hanging out with this woman,

554
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,239
and didn't even tell me.

555
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,919
What if I break in

556
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,600
and saw something wrong?

557
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,520
What should I do then?

558
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,320
Therefore,

559
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,360
what exactly is your problem?

560
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,000
Is he meeting a woman

561
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,719
and did not tell you,

562
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,399
right?

563
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,959
Let's not get angry

564
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,719
and afraid.

565
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,280
None of this is your problem,

566
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,760
but the pregestational hormone.

567
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,159
You're pregnant.

568
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,439
You might be overthinking.

569
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,199
Sometimes you'd be a little suspicious,

570
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,360
but it's normal.

571
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,719
Now we figure it out,

572
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,399
okay?

573
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's go check.

574
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,800
Could you be with me?

575
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,199
Of course.

576
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:37,959
You know why I'm here, don't you?

577
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,399
Come.

578
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:43,639
When will the pregestational hormone

579
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:44,600
drop?

580
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,320
I'm looking forward to our success.

581
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,000
Me too.

582
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,959
Good, good.

583
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,199
Can't wait to cooperate with you.

584
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,080
Mengxin.

585
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,760
Sister. Hi.

586
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,280
what are you two doing here?

587
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,000
Let me introduce.

588
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,120
This is a big influencer,

589
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:58,959
Ms. Lily.

590
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:00,159
A super influence

591
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,239
with millions of followers.

592
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,199
This is my wife Xu Mengxin,

593
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
and my sister Xu Meng'an.

594
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,800
Mr. Jia, your wife is pretty.

595
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,159
I don't look good,

596
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,520
but I have a good taste.

597
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,199
All my family are beautiful,

598
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,320
so the foundation for our future cooperation

599
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,040
is very solid.

600
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:14,239
I'm leaving.

601
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:14,719
Okay, okay.

602
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,399
Who is she?

603
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,199
Are we going to do e-commerce.

604
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,040
This is a super influencer

605
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,199
with millions of followers.

606
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,080
I must be begging her

607
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,360
to cooperate with me from now on.

608
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,399
I'm taking her to the factory

609
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:28,199
to show her around.

610
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,560
Eat whatever you want. It's all on me.

611
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,120
-Okay.

612
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,479
-Sister,

613
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,080
-Go, go, go.

614
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,959
-You stay with Mengxin.

615
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,040
Not as pretty as I am indeed.

616
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,560
Mine is very good.

617
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,520
Try it.

618
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,320
No.

619
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:56,320
Take a sip.

620
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,800
How could you be like this?

621
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,600
What?

622
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,040
It's my first time to know

623
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,199
someone who failed to bust cheating can react like this.

624
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,239
My husband is not cheating on me.

625
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,199
Shouldn't I be happy?

626
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,840
Or maybe should I cry?

627
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,000
This is our playfulness.

628
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,040
You can't get it.

629
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,239
The next time you two play,

630
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,360
don't get me involved, please.

631
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,080
Mengxin,

632
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,520
have you noticed

633
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,239
this pregnancy

634
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,560
feels different from the time

635
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,080
you had Xiongxiong?

636
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,320
I do think so.

637
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,760
I know, sometimes

638
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,199
I do overreact.

639
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,959
But I can't help it.

640
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,199
How is that?

641
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
Maybe

642
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
I was thinking

643
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,479
Xiongxiong is the pledge of love

644
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,360
between Haowen and me.

645
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,959
But this time,

646
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
I didn't want it at the beginning.

647
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,280
You don't want it.

648
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
You should have made a decision earlier.

649
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,439
Look at this bump now.

650
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:01,760
Why are you still strolling around?

651
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,439
He wants this baby.

652
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,679
You're messing with him like this.

653
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,959
Didn't he react?

654
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,639
What reactions should he have?

655
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,320
He should be happy.

656
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,760
That shows I love him.

657
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,919
I care about him.

658
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:15,959
I care about him.

659
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:17,360
Am I wrong?

660
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,919
Surely you're right to care about him,

661
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,479
but the way you do it

662
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,959
is wrong.

663
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:28,679
You asked someone to take picture of him.

664
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:29,520
Does he know it?

665
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,360
Of course not.

666
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,080
Are you idiot?

667
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,199
If he knows,

668
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,520
it won't be candid photography.

669
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:37,639
You must stop now.

670
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,320
Mengxin,

671
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,760
you can make fun,

672
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:44,520
but the basic trust of a couple

673
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,439
shall exist.

674
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,479
You can't tell him about it.

675
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,040
That depends on my mood.

676
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,560
Whom are you siding with?

677
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,159
Our family are all his side,

678
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,120
obviously.

679
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,639
Did you know why Mom and Dad

680
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,639
agreed you two got married?

681
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,239
At that time

682
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:07,959
he had nothing,

683
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,040
and was nobody,

684
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:09,800
but

685
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,040
he is really a good person,

686
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,639
not to mention he loves you so much

687
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:14,719
and treats you well.

688
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,040
If he...

689
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,760
If he didn't love me,

690
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
and treat me well,

691
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:22,719
would I have the second child for him.

692
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,080
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

693
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:38,040
Here, taste it.

694
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,000
So sweet!

695
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,639
Babies.

696
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,600
To our new home, here,

697
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,639
cheers.

698
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:57,679
-Cheers. -Cheers.

699
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,080
Thanks, mom.

700
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,159
It would be great,

701
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,280
if daddy was here with us.

702
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Daddy is busy with work usually,

703
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,199
but he will come on weekends

704
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:16,919
to have dinner

705
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:17,879
and play with you.

706
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:19,879
Oh, mom,

707
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,159
there's a classmate

708
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,679
who is very close to me

709
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,520
is transferring to another school next week.

710
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,280
Why was that?

711
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,520
I heard her parents are divorced,

712
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,719
and cannot afford the tuition.

713
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,000
Nonsense.

714
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,879
Those are all guesses from classmates.

715
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,120
Can we

716
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,439
not afford the tuition either?

717
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,159
I don't want to transfer to other schools.

718
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:39,800
Don't worry.

719
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,280
Mom has enough money.

720
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,399
It definitely won't affect

721
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,760
your lives and studies.

722
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,679
But I heard daddy said

723
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:47,080
the money you earned every month

724
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:47,879
can't afford

725
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,040
our football class.

726
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,399
Eat your food!

727
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,679
You talked too much.

728
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,280
Though mom hasn't been

729
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,320
working for a long time,

730
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,199
mom can

731
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,520
start from the beginning.

732
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,520
Just like you two,

733
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,239
we start from the first grade, right?

734
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:03,840
You won't

735
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,679
always be in the first grade,

736
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,280
will you?

737
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,280
Then mom will study really hard,

738
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,439
and make more money

739
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,719
in the future.

740
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Trust me.

741
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,320
Mom, I believe in you.

742
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,560
You surely can do it.

743
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,080
Thanks, my sweetheart.

744
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,959
It's okay.

745
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,439
It's daddy!

746
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:22,679
Daddy.

747
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,620
What are you doing? having dinner?

748
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,879
Yes, I'm having dinner.

749
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:27,439
Here's a live stream for you.

750
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,320
See.

751
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Your favorite boiled shrimp,

752
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,800
Chunjiang fish,

753
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,080
bamboo shoots with pork,

754
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,239
and braised pork.

755
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,159
That's great!

756
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,679
Where's your sister?

757
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Daddy.

758
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,120
What are you eating?

759
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,239
It looks so good.

760
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,520
Big shrimps.

761
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,280
Can you feed daddy one?

762
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,040
Sure.

763
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,120
It tastes so good.

764
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,439
Having more for Daddy.

765
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:57,719
Daddy,

766
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,120
what are you eating for dinner?

767
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,040
Show us.

768
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:00,760
Yes.

769
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,719
Me...?

770
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:04,399
Daddy is too busy with work

771
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,360
to have dinner yet.

772
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,239
You have so much delicious food.

773
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,360
It really makes me drool over.

774
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,080
Feed daddy one more.

775
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,600
Okay.

776
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,919
Daddy is able to reach it

777
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,639
but to eat the air, right?

778
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:21,239
What should I do?

779
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,120
Daddy is missing you.

780
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,719
I can only make a video call.

781
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,080
Where's mom?

782
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,520
Here.

783
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,399
Daddy.

784
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,360
Let me show you around

785
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,159
our new house.

786
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,159
Mom, you have it as well.

787
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,879
Thanks, sweetheart.

788
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,679
You eat it, here.

789
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,600
Come.

790
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,120
Mr. Yu.

791
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,919
The instant noodles you asked.

792
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,439
Have you added what I want?

793
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,320
Yes.

794
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:53,919
Two spiced eggs,

795
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,959
ham sausage and luncheon meat for you.

796
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,360
Good, thanks.

797
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,159
Let me show you daddy's dinner.

798
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,360
A little bit of sadfishing.

799
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,520
Come in.

800
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,520
Mr. Yu.

801
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,679
Mr. Yu.

802
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:24,120
Mr. Zhou, what brings you here?

803
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:24,959
Passing by.

804
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,600
What are you eating? Instant noodles.

805
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:28,320
Looks sad.

806
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:29,320
No,

807
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,520
some time in a while

808
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,879
I'd miss it.

809
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,919
I usually eat in the dining room,

810
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,199
but I often think about

811
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,040
this taste in college dorms.

812
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,840
How nice!

813
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,239
Alright, then.

814
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,040
I'm leaving.

815
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,080
I came to Blue Ocean

816
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,959
and looked around.

817
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,000
Now Blue Ocean is on the

818
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,879
inspection period.

819
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:48,959
I just take a look and leave now.

820
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,080
You're making a surprise check.

821
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,080
I'm not.

822
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,439
Rest assured, Mr. Zhou.

823
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,280
Blue Ocean has been the same

824
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,120
as time went by.

825
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:58,120
We're absolutely transparent.

826
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,520
Welcome investors to check at any time.

827
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,159
Or I'll show you more specifically.

828
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,159
It's okay, It's okay.

829
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,919
I've seen it.

830
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,040
The future work would be taken over

831
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,120
by these two investment managers.

832
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,439
I have a business dinner

833
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,520
nearby,

834
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:12,560
and I passed by here.

835
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:14,159
That reminds me of you.

836
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,439
If it's convenient,

837
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:17,560
I can go with you.

838
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:18,760
The bill is one me.

839
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,280
It's okay.

840
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:19,919
Inconvenient.

841
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,760
You can't waste your

842
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,879
nice instant noodles.

843
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:23,560
Alright, I'm leaving.

844
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,760
Eat it now,

845
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:25,919
or the noodles are getting dry.

846
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,080
Take your time.

847
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,879
The noodles...

848
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,840
Am I eating this at a good time?

849
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,360
I sleep on the upper.

850
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,879
No.

851
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,080
I sleep on the upper.

852
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,239
I've won so many times.

853
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,560
You are...you are cheating.

854
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,239
You know that?

855
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,560
I was not ready.

856
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,520
One more time.

857
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,719
-Rock, scissors, paper. -Rock, scissors, paper.

858
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:51,520
I won!

859
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:52,719
No, I want the top bunk.

860
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:54,520
Just let me.

861
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,360
No.

862
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,959
If you don't let me...

863
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,120
What are you fighting about?

864
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,879
Come down.

865
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,120
You can't get up tomorrow if you don't sleep.

866
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,040
Mom,

867
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
you say something to sister.

868
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,719
She doesn't let me sleep on the upper.

869
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,280
She's the one who lost and cheated.

870
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,360
Mom, you decide who is right.

871
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,320
You all want to sleep the top bunk, right?

872
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,080
What if one of you

873
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,520
sleep for a week in turns?

874
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,360
Then the first week is mine.

875
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,879
No!

876
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,520
Weren't you just talking to daddy,

877
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
saying big house is good?

878
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,239
And now you're fighting me for the upper.

879
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,159
I've changed my mind.

880
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,840
Now I think this is the best place.

881
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:24,919
The best place

882
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:25,760
in the world, in the universe

883
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,919
is this top bunk.

884
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,239
Alright, alright, enough of this.

885
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,600
How about tonight

886
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,280
you share the top bunk.

887
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:33,439
Never mind, let her have it.

888
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,679
But we have to exchange next time,

889
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,080
or I won't talk to you if you cheat again.

890
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,280
Sister is the best, I love you.

891
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,639
Hurry,

892
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:40,959
go to the bed,

893
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,320
otherwise, you can't get up tomorrow.

894
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Cover yourself well.

895
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,719
Zhenzhen, cover yourself well.

896
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:48,199
Okay.

897
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,040
Turn off the little light.

898
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:52,080
Okay.

899
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:54,040
Goodnight, babies.

900
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,120
-Mom, goodnight. -Mom, goodnight.

901
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,919
-Goodnight.

902
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,360
Sister, the top bunk is really good,

903
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,719
better than the camping tent.

904
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,639
We made it a deal

905
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:10,520
to exchange this time next week.

906
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:11,919
I know, sister.

907
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:13,320
Sister,

908
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,239
you love this house,

909
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,760
or the old one?

910
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,679
I like both,

911
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,560
but mom lives in this house,

912
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,760
so I like this better.

913
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,159
If

914
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:22,679
there's one more bathroom,

915
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:23,639
that would be great,

916
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,479
or I have to fight with you

917
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:26,520
when I need to go to the bathroom.

918
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:28,239
If

919
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,199
it can be closer to the school,

920
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,520
that's even better,

921
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:32,520
or,

922
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,399
we have to get up

923
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:34,520
half an hour earlier.

924
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,360
You live in the school playground then.

925
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,600
That's the closest.

926
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:38,919
I can bring my bed

927
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:39,879
there?

928
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,080
The top bunk is still mine.

929
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:42,639
Hurry to sleep.

930
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,000
Whoever gets up early tomorrow

931
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:47,080
can use the bathroom first.

932
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,919
Fine.

933
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:48,639
It's deal.

934
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:50,199
No cheating.

935
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,080
Zhenzhen, goodnight.

936
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,040
Goodnight, sister.

937
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,560
How's the talk with

938
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Mr. Ma today?

939
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,879
Pretty nice.

940
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,959
He told me

941
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,159
to start work as soon as possible,

942
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,560
and check in next Monday.

943
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,439
Next Monday?

944
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,080
Working at lab

945
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,560
can't make as much money as in enterprise,

946
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,520
but once I'm on duty,

947
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,799
our family

948
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,080
would get better.

949
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,880
I was thinking

950
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
next week I'd take the annual vacation,

951
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,040
and get the surgery,

952
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,080
but your job is a big deal,

953
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:42,880
you check in first.

954
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,520
Meng'an.

955
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,040
Have you really

956
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,639
decided to do the surgery?

957
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,159
To be honest?

958
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,839
No.

959
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,639
But I don't think this is a good time to have a baby.

960
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,440
Zhang has been looking for someone else.

961
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,719
If I had a baby,

962
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,040
he'd lay me off.

963
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:21,880
If I lost my job,

964
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,120
our family would depend on you

965
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,080
alone?

966
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:25,719
It'd the same story as now.

967
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,520
No,

968
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,639
it'd get worse.

969
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,520
What about you?

970
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,960
What do you think?

971
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,319
To be honest?

972
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
I want this baby.

973
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:19,880
You are so early.

974
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,799
I dropped my kids to school,

975
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:22,639
then came over.

976
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,679
The ones having children

977
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,080
get up early.

978
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,239
Here, Mr. Sun.

979
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,080
Thanks.

980
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:30,560
Mr. Sun,

981
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,639
I want to discuss something with you.

982
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,560
Have a seat.

983
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,520
First, I'd like to thank you specially

984
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,880
for offering me this job,

985
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,319
however, I'd like to transfer to sales position,

986
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,520
could you help me?

987
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
You want to do sales?

988
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,120
I want to make more money.

989
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,679
As far as I know,

990
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,920
your home conditions are good.

991
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,679
Like the car,

992
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,600
every day you come to work,

993
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,080
you park it far away,

994
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,679
but actually, your car

995
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,440
is better than mine.

996
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,960
You know,

997
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,279
I used to

998
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,520
be a full-time wife.

999
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,719
The wealth is

1000
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,080
not earned by me.

1001
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:12,239
You've seen the situation

1002
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,440
of my family that day.

1003
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm going to divorce.

1004
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,199
I'm sorry about that.

1005
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,880
I don't know much about that.

1006
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:24,159
Are you seriously going to do this?

1007
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,279
We've already separated.

1008
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,319
I'm working on the proceedings now.

1009
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,440
I'm fighting for

1010
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,520
the custody of two kids,

1011
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,000
therefore, I need higher

1012
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,920
payroll statement

1013
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,560
to prove my financial capacity.

1014
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,159
Besides, the kids have

1015
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:39,880
psychological gap

1016
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
after moving out,

1017
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,239
I also want them to have confidence

1018
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
that there's no need to live a hard life

1019
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,359
with her mom.

1020
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,520
Wanzhen.

1021
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:49,719
Let me

1022
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,279
be honest.

1023
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,759
Being a salesman

1024
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,279
is not for everyone.

1025
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,759
I have also seen your resume.

1026
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,880
Your previous job

1027
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,080
is very decent.

1028
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
Now you have two kids

1029
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,159
while doing sales

1030
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,359
day and night.

1031
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,560
Sometimes you need to drink.

1032
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,040
Can you handle it?

1033
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,120
If you did transfer

1034
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,040
to do sales,

1035
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,839
have you considered the minimum salary?

1036
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,880
Almost zero.

1037
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:15,319
The worse situation is

1038
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:16,080
you will lose your current position.

1039
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:16,759
So,

1040
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:17,960
think about it seriously,

1041
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:19,159
then make a decision.

1042
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,639
Do it.

1043
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,239
You have to.

1044
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,040
I do think so.

1045
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,520
And I just mentioned it to Mr. Sun.

1046
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,759
But I think

1047
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,520
he got the point, too.

1048
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,319
If you don't do well in sales,

1049
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:38,080
you might even lose the clerk position.

1050
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,239
Then what?

1051
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,080
Find another one.

1052
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,120
Let's not talk about how much money you can make.

1053
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,960
In the case of a property enterprise,

1054
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,480
the most important core department

1055
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,279
is sales.

1056
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,799
In a long-term plan,

1057
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,199
you should enter the core field of

1058
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,679
the company.

1059
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,359
You're right.

1060
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,920
Hearing your view,

1061
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,279
I feel peaceful now.

1062
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,719
But I still worry,

1063
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,080
although I know a few women

1064
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,440
who can afford a house,

1065
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,520
how long can it be?

1066
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,199
Who cares?

1067
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,239
One day at a time.

1068
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,960
Distribute your sales to them properly.

1069
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,120
Sell one house in a month.

1070
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:12,000
At least for these months,

1071
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,279
your performance and payroll statement

1072
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:14,440
are good.

1073
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,000
It's enough for you to file a lawsuit,

1074
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,520
am I right?

1075
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,679
If you really

1076
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,520
don't believe in yourself,

1077
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,799
then improve yourself

1078
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:21,880
while selling houses.

1079
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,000
When the day when

1080
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,120
sales can't go on,

1081
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,440
do something else.

1082
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,960
Maybe

1083
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
you can go up to a higher level,

1084
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,400
right?

1085
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,480
Right.

1086
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,520
I know what to do now.

1087
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,520
Come on!

1088
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
How do you do?

1089
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,560
Have you talked about

1090
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,639
the baby thing with Li Lin?

1091
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,400
I have.

1092
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,560
What're you going to do?

1093
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,520
No plans.

1094
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,279
This is the first time

1095
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,880
we've met something so tricky

1096
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,040
since we were together.

1097
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,279
Thinking back,

1098
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,080
he was so happy

1099
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,520
about the first birth

1100
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,839
that he can't wait for

1101
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,040
everyone to know I was pregnant.

1102
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,759
Now,

1103
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,279
all that he has is fear,

1104
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,960
fearing one more person will know

1105
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,799
I am pregnant.

1106
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:21,719
I think the two of us

1107
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,279
are both afraid to

1108
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:25,719
talk much about this subject.

1109
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,839
Like no one dares

1110
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:30,279
to make the decision.

1111
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,960
You two...

1112
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,520
Don't get too anxious.

1113
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:39,880
Give yourselves more time.

1114
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,759
Don't make decisions lightly

1115
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,600
till the final moment.

1116
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,839
After all,

1117
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,639
we're not young.

1118
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:56,319
You're transferring to sales?

1119
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:58,120
What about

1120
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,839
your current job?

1121
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,120
I can balance

1122
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,199
the daily administrative work.

1123
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,960
Didn't you say

1124
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,159
selling houses

1125
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,159
in a property company is all that matters.

1126
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,000
Recently.

1127
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,679
I've looked at

1128
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,359
some information

1129
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:11,080
of house sales.

1130
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:12,480
I can do it.

1131
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,319
Wanzhen.

1132
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:15,880
In fact, you can introduce customers

1133
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,120
to the sales department.

1134
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,400
You don't have to

1135
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,319
do it by yourself.

1136
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,279
And the sales department

1137
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:21,279
is not under-staffed.

1138
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,279
But I need this occupation.

1139
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,520
Mr. Qian,

1140
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,520
you don't have to answer me right now.

1141
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,000
I can start from now,

1142
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,319
I've counted.

1143
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,520
With the interpersonal network I have,

1144
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:33,480
I guarantee

1145
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:35,000
I can sell six houses.

1146
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,679
Six?

1147
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,000
All we have this time is advanced houses.

1148
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,199
They are all large ones.

1149
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,960
Understand.

1150
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,880
That's why

1151
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,520
you need salesperson like me.

1152
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:44,000
Look,

1153
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,040
who else in our company

1154
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,199
is better than me

1155
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,880
to sell this kind of high-end property?

1156
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,880
Sales is not one-shot deals.

1157
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Whatever it is or not,

1158
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,159
but this shot

1159
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,960
will bring you at least six houses.

1160
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:55,880
Would I

1161
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,199
offend Mr. Yu if so?

1162
00:41:58,359 --> 00:41:59,960
That depends on what you want.

1163
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,000
Compared to offend Mr. Yu,

1164
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,199
what you get

1165
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,000
is solid  performance.

1166
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Please consider it.

1167
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,480
Wanzhen.

1168
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,159
If you can't bring results,

1169
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,719
I may let you quit.

1170
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,520
No problem.

1171
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,600
Chen Wanzhen,

1172
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,799
are you going to transfer to sales?

1173
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:23,960
Yes.

1174
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,319
This way, Mengxin.

1175
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:43,239
It's okay.

1176
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:51,839
Your turn.

1177
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,239
Come.

1178
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:19,400
Mengxin?

1179
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,199
High progesterone values.

1180
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,120
But you don't need to worry.

1181
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:32,719
Relax and adjust your mindset.

1182
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:33,839
pay attention to sleep.

1183
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,000
It would be fine

1184
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,639
after bringing down the progesterone.

1185
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,400
It's okay, Mengxin.

1186
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,719
You should care more about

1187
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:49,400
your wife's psychological state.

1188
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,359
This is her report of

1189
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,319
mental health.

1190
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,359
Disqualified.

1191
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,719
What should I do?

1192
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,799
Take it easy.

1193
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,199
Here is the thing.

1194
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,199
The pregnant women's hormones

1195
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,880
will be higher during pregnancy,

1196
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:05,880
which will lead to

1197
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,000
her emotional instability.

1198
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,239
However,

1199
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:09,159
they can't take medicine

1200
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,400
during pregnancy.

1201
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:11,719
Therefore,

1202
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:12,759
family members should

1203
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:14,159
be more attentive to her.

1204
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,560
It's okay, Mengxin.
