00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,520
Hello, everyone.

4
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,919
I am Xu Meng'an,

5
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,760
content director of

6
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Chunjiang Xinmiao Media.

7
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,640
Welcome all of you.

8
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,640
Today I want to talk about

9
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,439
the Internet industry...

10
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,520
Director Xu.

11
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,400
There will be no press conference.

12
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,120
The company went bankrupt.

13
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,559
We are all unemployed.

14
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,800
Nonsense.

15
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:47,839
Let me finish

16
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,680
the slides first.

17
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,599
Where's everyone?

18
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,120
Where's everyone?

19
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,240
Where are they?

20
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,960
Xu Meng'an.

21
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,159
Xu Meng'an.

22
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,480
Xu Meng'an.

23
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,839
Xu Meng'an.

24
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,839
Xu Meng'an.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,999
Xu Meng'an.

26
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,039
Xu Meng'an.

27
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,719
Your mortgage is overdue.

28
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:27,599
Please pay within the time limit.

29
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,400
Xu Meng'an.

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,999
This month's

31
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,159
credit card bill is as follows.

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,839
Please pay back in time.

33
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,640
Xu Meng'an.

34
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,759
Your company

35
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,800
has gone bankrupt and been liquidated.

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
No severance package for you.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,240
Xu Meng'an.

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,759
Xu Meng'an.

39
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,839
I've been telling you about

40
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,719
customer pain points.

41
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:41,920
What about the pain points?

42
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,960
Director Xu.

43
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,199
Sorry.

44
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,120
He.

45
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,240
Such a simple

46
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,120
slide file.

47
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,959
You adjusted it three times.

48
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,800
And you asked me what the problem was.

49
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,840
How about

50
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,800
I feed you meals,

51
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,240
and you swallow it.

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,399
Is that good?

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,360
Well.

54
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,240
Stop it. Hang up.

55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,639
She pissed me off.

56
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
I think she's been working

57
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
on it all night.

58
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,879
So her brain isn't functioning.

59
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,280
Do it yourself

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,680
if you can.

61
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,840
What about her role?

62
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,160
Well, I'll get you something

63
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,959
you can swallow without chewing.

64
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,439
He.

65
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,199
I have sent

66
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,680
the revised file to your inbox.

67
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Take a good look.

68
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:06,840
Don't make

69
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,920
the same mistake again.

70
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,160
Porridge.

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
Wake Yunjie up.

72
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,079
Put your mobile phone around.

73
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,199
Yunjie.

74
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,439
Get up.

75
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,040
Yunjie. Come on.

76
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,480
Li Lin. Are you ready?

77
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,639
You haven't finished yet?

79
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,559
Hurry up.

80
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,879
Dad, you are so handsome today.

81
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,879
He has been handsome

82
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,160
recently.

83
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,720
What for?

84
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,199
Meet a customer.

85
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,519
You going out for marketing?

86
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,840
My boss let me,

87
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,920
so I have to go.

88
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,680
Competition is fierce now.

89
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,519
Market is more important than

90
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,480
research and development.

91
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
That makes sense.

92
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,720
Just put it there.

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,759
I'll come back to clean up later.

94
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
You'll be back soon?

95
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,840
It doesn't take much time

96
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,040
to meet the customer.

97
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,519
I will slack off my work.

98
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Go to the company in the afternoon.

99
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
You are still not enterprising.

100
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,840
Good.

101
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:19,999
Are you going or not?

102
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,240
Yeah, right away.

103
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,199
Yunjie.

104
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,360
Let's go.

105
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,199
OK.

106
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,879
Hurry up.

107
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,559
Let's go.

108
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,800
How to break dilemma in workplace?

109
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,800
How to expand your career?

110
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,399
40 must-learn workplace courses.

111
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
Full analysis of private domain cases.

112
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,519
Help you realize your career leap.

113
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,480
This is your company's

114
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,920
lecture?

115
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,439
Yeah.

116
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,280
How much is it?

117
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,480
About 300 RMB.

118
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,680
Does anyone buy it?

119
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,439
Of course.

120
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,680
I sold over 7000 copies in two days.

121
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,120
It sells well.

122
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,440
About what?

123
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,600
Experience of success.

124
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,999
Spend hundreds of RMB

125
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:06,799
to know others' decades of

126
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,399
experience in success.

127
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,080
It's a great deal.

128
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,399
You don't have to

129
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,480
go through decades

130
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
to sum up.

131
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,679
It's too late.

132
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,440
Dad, change the channel.

133
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,960
Why?

134
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,039
Listen to something relaxing

135
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,560
in the morning.

136
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,159
You are a student now.

137
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,279
So you feel bored.

138
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,159
When you

139
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,560
reach our age,

140
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,480
you will know

141
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,999
what you have learned in school

142
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,679
is not enough.

143
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,360
Don't fire me up.

144
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,999
No. No. No.

145
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,519
This is called never too old to learn.

146
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,120
You know?

147
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,799
Who said that?

148
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,399
Solon,

149
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,679
Athenian statesman,

150
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,279
Greece.

151
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,279
International common language for

152
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,519
more than two thousand years.

153
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,560
Mom.

154
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,159
Compete with

155
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,799
your colleagues,

156
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,120
not with me.

157
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,799
OK?

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
Don't dislike

159
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,200
others' efforts

160
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,799
if you don't

161
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,159
work hard.

162
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,159
I just want to be relaxed.

163
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,999
But you have to fire me up.

164
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
No.

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,039
This is the way to survive.

166
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,200
To develop better in the workplace.

167
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,840
So what does the workplace want?

168
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,440
Yunjie.

169
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,399
Let's listen to it. It's good.

170
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,519
Let's study.

171
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,080
There may be

172
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,159
more opportunities.

173
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,679
I love to hear that.

174
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:26,999
The opportunity

175
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,679
is so rare.

176
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
Where shall I take you today?

177
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,440
I...

178
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,159
I am

179
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,039
with Yunjie.

180
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,600
Witness the promotion of

181
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080

182
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,799

Here are the online courses for working people.

185
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,200
It's not that easy.

186
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,560
Practical skills developed by

187
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Professor Shang.

188
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,840
Decipher six major workplace skills.

189
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,879
Improve your delivering ability.

190
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,200
Diligence.

191
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,639
Transition.

192
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,399
Are you okay?

193
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,039
Yeah.

194
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,039
Take a picture of me.

195
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,120
Director Xu.

196
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,279
Why do you take pictures here?

197
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,919
We are leaving today.

198
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,080
So we take pictures to remember.

199
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,480
OK.

200
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,720
Has it started?

201
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,080
Mr. Li.

202
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,919
For how long did you leave your job?

203
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,279
More than three months.

204
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,039
To be exact,

205
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,759
three months and 21 days.

206
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,720
In the meantime,

207
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,999
what are you doing?

208
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,159
Looking for a job.

209
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,480
And do some odd jobs.

210
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,519
Mr. Zhao.

211
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,360
Mr. Li.

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,159
There you are.

213
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,080
We're waiting for you.

214
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,120
Look at it.

215
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,600
OK, leave it to me.

216
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,480
Here are the clothes.

217
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,960
OK.

218
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,759
Do odd jobs?

219
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,560
Do some technical output.

220
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,360
Just

221
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,560
help the installation team

222
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,799
outsourced by the former company

223
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,919
commission the equipment.

224
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,879
You are willing to do it?

225
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,120
Well.

226
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
You're adjusting well.

227
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,120
It's a serious situation.

228
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,399
You'll be the next.

229
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,679
I talked to Mr. Zhang.

230
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,240
He promised not to lay us off.

231
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,039
Everything changes.

232
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,799
I don't accept it.

233
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,360
I need to talk to him.

234
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,519
It's useless.

235
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,480
The situation is worse than

236
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
we thought.

237
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,919
Where are we going

238
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
after being laid off?

239
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,799
I looked at your resume.

240
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,159
You have worked in this company

241
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,360
for about eight years.

242
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,360
But your position

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
has never changed.

244
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,519
Yeah.

245
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,720
It hasn't changed.

246
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,759
That's because

247
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,600
my major is technology.

248
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,279
I am good at technology.

249
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:06,799
Do you find it

250
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,039
hard to work

251
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,999
in a technical post

252
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
at your age?

253
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,519
No.

254
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,240
I can still do it.

255
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
Okay, I see.

256
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,159
Wait for the notice.

257
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,600
Director Li.

258
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,120
You see,

259
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,960
about my current situation,

260
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,159
your company...

261
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,039
I want to know

262
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,200
the reason

263
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,519
for your leaving.

264
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,919
Well.

265
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,080
Our local branch

266
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,200
was downgraded

267
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,560
to an office.

268
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,360
So my whole department

269
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,799
was laid off.

270
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,799
You see,

271
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,519
you graduated from a famous university.

272
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,080
And

273
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,720
you have a lot of work experience.

274
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:48,840
But to be honest,

275
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,480
this is

276
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,679
a junior post.

277
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,960
We prefer to hire young  people.

278
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,120
You are forty years old.

279
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,480
I suggest

280
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,919
you can be

281
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,320
a manager

282
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,279
if possible.

283
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm not good at

284
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,240
management.

285
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,919
I...

286
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,639
Director Li.

287
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,799
Actually,

288
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,960
I can accept

289
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,399
a pay cut.

290
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,240
Man struggles upwards.

291
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,039
Yeah.

292
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,039
You can go to other companies.

293
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,480
You still have a lot of chances.

294
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,720
Sorry.

295
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,759
Get the next one in.

296
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,039
Mr. Zhang.

297
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,360
Director Xu.

298
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,519
He's not here.

299
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,159
He asked me to

300
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,159
get him something.

301
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,759
OK.

302
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,440
Mr. Li.

303
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:44,600
You see,

304
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,080
all the equipment in our company

305
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
is handled by you.

306
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,759
We trust you

307
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,720
most.

308
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
It's my duty.

309
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,279
I have commissioned

310
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,519
all the equipment.

311
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,960
I'll check it again.

312
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,600
OK.

313
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,120
I'll take this call.

314
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,999
Well.

315
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,200
Hello.

316
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,399
Excuse me, is this Li Lin?

317
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,519
Yeah.

318
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,679
Mr. Li.

319
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:16,960
Your loan account

320
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,840
is overdue.

321
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,440
Please deposit enough funds

322
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,279
into your account in time.

323
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,080
Your credit record will be affected

324
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,639
if it exceeds ten days.

325
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,039
Yes.

326
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:25,840
Okay.

327
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,360
I'll handle it.

328
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:29,639
Goodbye.

329
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,000
Mr. Zhang.

330
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,360
Get something and I'll leave.

331
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,399
I know.

332
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:02,159
Just a few words.

333
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:02,639
Another time.

334
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,000
Just...

335
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,199
Just a few words.

336
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
A few words.

337
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,959
This is

338
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,239
the project I mentioned to you

339
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,000
before.

340
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,439
I've inspected it.

341
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,159
In the past six months, it has

342
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,520
received special attention abroad.

343
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,959
As long as we can start early,

344
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,399
we can still

345
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,760
make a profit.

346
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,120
Oh, no.

347
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,439
What exactly do you want?

348
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,159
I want to do something.

349
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,520
And of course I need staff.

350
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,080
But I don't need to recruit.

351
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,399
Just those people I have now.

352
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:41,159
Enough.

353
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,120
The new project has stopped.

354
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,080
Just do

355
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,639
the paid projects well.

356
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:46,639
Do you want to

357
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:47,800
talk about layoffs?

358
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,000
It's settled.

359
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,399
You promised

360
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,560
not to lay off my people.

361
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,639
It's no use.

362
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,080
The investor quitted.

363
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,120
I have no money

364
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,520
to invest in new projects for you.

365
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,719
Are you sure?

366
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,520
I won't lie to you.

367
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:04,760
When did this happen?

368
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,199
It's been a few days.

369
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,520
I have been keeping it from you

370
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,879
for fear of causing turmoil.

371
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,479
I'm looking for new investments.

372
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:16,439
Are those

373
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,040
employees

374
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,280
really going to be fired?

375
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,360
Content Department is very important.

376
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,959
They are all experienced staff.

377
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,840
Juniors and seniors make no difference.

378
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,719
Just keep

379
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,760
useful employees.

380
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,080
And

381
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,719
I don't want to do that.

382
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,360
It's embarrassing.

383
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,600
I think we have done quite well

384
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,919
in recent years.

385
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,320
How can they

386
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
just quit?

387
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,239
How can I know

388
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,320
what the investor thinks?

389
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,360
I'll tell you when I become

390
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,000
an investor.

391
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,639
Now the company

392
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,239
has no money.

393
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,120
Well.

394
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,280
With layoffs,

395
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,760
the company may survive.

396
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,439
If not,

397
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,239
it will be over.

398
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:02,959
Mr. Zhang.

399
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,639
Director Xu.

400
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:10,399
Please understand Mr. Zhang.

401
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,120
He has been very anxious recently.

402
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,679
He has an infusion now.

403
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,040
Cut it and go ahead.

404
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,560
Wait a minute.

405
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,719
I'm

406
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,199
going to work.

407
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,600
Take care of yourself.

408
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,360
Hello.

409
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,840
Miss Xu Mengxin.

410
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,479
I prepared

411
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,600
some cakes for kids.

412
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,120
No, thanks.

413
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,479
Everything is ready.

414
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,679
Did you

415
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,760
make all these yourselves?

416
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:16,439
Yeah.

417
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,760
It's all made by us.

418
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
That's amazing.

419
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,919
Kids should eat

420
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,199
healthier.

421
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,159
These finished products

422
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,439
contain pigments

423
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,639
and preservatives,

424
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:27,840
which are not good for them.

425
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,439
Right?

426
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,199
Is everything ready?

427
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah.

428
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,760
Hello.

429
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,840
It's all arranged.

430
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
Please ask them to come over.

431
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:36,080
Thank you.

432
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,840
We're leaving.

433
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,600
Bye.

434
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,360
Bye.

435
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,199
Bye.

436
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,080
See you.

437
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,639
My god.

438
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:40,679
You didn't wash your face?

439
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,360
Not yet.

440
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,479
Why are you looking for me?

441
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,320
Director Xu.

442
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:52,280
Sorry.

443
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,919
I don't want to hear that anymore.

444
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,639
If I have to clean up

445
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,560
your mess again,

446
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,800
you will bear the consequences.

447
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,800
I have studied

448
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,239
your revised materials.

449
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,239
Why didn't I think of that before?

450
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:02,879
I will definitely

451
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,199
work hard.

452
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,239
Just go home and sleep.

453
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,360
I won't go home.

454
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,520
No.

455
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:11,600
I am not sleepy.

456
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,800
I slept for two hours just now.

457
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,760
I still have a lot of work to finish.

458
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,199
Brush your teeth and wash your face.

459
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,120
Have breakfast.

460
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,439
I'm not hungry.

461
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,800
Your image is important,

462
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,360
so is your health.

463
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,199
You know?

464
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,560
I will wash my face first.

465
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
No water here.

466
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,639
It's a material to assess

467
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:11,360
your staff in the department this year.

468
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,199
This is for your reference

469
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,520
for layoffs.

470
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:16,080
You are looking for food again.

471
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
You ate everything

472
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,479
my husband bought me.

473
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,719
What about chocolate?

474
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,280
He didn't do well enough.

475
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,199
He didn't replenish the goods.

476
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,679
There is no chocolate left.

477
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:29,120
How's it going?

478
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,360
Do you have anyone in mind?

479
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,239
No, I don't want to fire anyone.

480
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,239
It's hard for you?

481
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,040
Are you excited?

482
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,679
It's rare.

483
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:46,360
They are all

484
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,639
recruited

485
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:48,760
and trained by me.

486
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,320
I can't decide.

487
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:51,719
It is not as simple as

488
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:52,560
giving up.

489
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:54,120
Start with

490
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,439
employees with poor performances.

491
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,800
He

492
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,520
is reckless all day.

493
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,280
I met her several times

494
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,439
in the bathroom,

495
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,360
brushing her teeth and

496
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,280
washing her face, with water all over.

497
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,600
I'm embarrassed to remind her.

498
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,760
She was working overtime

499
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:09,919
all night in the company.

500
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,040
Work overtime?

501
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,520
But her performance is still poor.

502
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,120
She is competent.

503
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,840
So you bullied her?

504
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,239
Don't be ridiculous.

505
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,199
Oh, no.

506
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,639
Competence

507
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,000
and hard work

508
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,800
are two things.

509
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,639
Hard work is also a talent.

510
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:27,239
No.

511
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,320
It is a quality.

512
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,120
Perhaps it is a choice.

513
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:33,919
It is valuable.

514
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,520
Let me tell you something serious.

515
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,159
Today they are all talking about

516
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,439
Mr. Zhang selling his house.

517
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,439
He wants to

518
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,800
save the company with the money.

519
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,879
Can his wife agree?

520
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:52,520
I don't know.

521
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,080
He may be helping me lay off staff.

522
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,760
So he deliberately let the news out

523
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,320
to make them feel sorry for him.

524
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:01,840
You think too much.

525
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,879
He left with a real estate certificate.

526
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,719
Then I have to hurry.

527
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,120
You too.

528
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,360
Can't we delay it?

529
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,600
It's not my call.

530
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Add delicious food.

531
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,679
There is no chocolate left.

532
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,959
Go find a boyfriend.

533
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,600
I failed.

534
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,439
Li Lin.

535
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:32,800
Why did you

536
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,320
come to me today?

537
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,159
It's been a long time since we met.

538
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,719
Yeah. Long time no see.

539
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:38,800
I

540
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,840
passed by here

541
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,679
today.

542
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:42,600
I thought,

543
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,520
are you still here?

544
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,479
So you still run your shop?

545
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,159
Sure.

546
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:49,239
Here is

547
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,840
a treasure land.

548
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:52,080
Yeah.

549
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,719
It's

550
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,000
average,

551
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,520
but I do online business,

552
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,760
with an annual turnover

553
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,840
of 100 million.

554
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,959
100 million?

555
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,040
You are getting better and better.

556
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,360
What about you?

557
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,199
I'm still the same.

558
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,159
At that time,

559
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:16,679
I resigned and

560
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,040
wanted to invite you to work with me.

561
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,919
But you don't want to.

562
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,000
You are

563
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,320
in an awkward position in that company.

564
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,879
You are forty years old.

565
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:23,800
There is no future.

566
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,560
Right?

567
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,439
I have been thinking about you.

568
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,320
I want to

569
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,520
take you with me

570
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,159
to get rich.

571
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:31,560
Right?

572
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,199
Realize our

573
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,560
ideals back in college.

574
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,040
I'll tell you

575
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,199
what I've got.

576
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,040
What?

577
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,639
I'll give you a chance.

578
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,239
What?

579
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,600
You see,

580
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:44,520
it is an opportunity.

581
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,479
What?

582
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:48,600
Look.

583
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
Your oral liquid?

584
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,639
Yeah.

585
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,399
What did you give me this for?

586
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:52,840
I...

587
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,560
Let me tell you.

588
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,520
It's

589
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,320
a

590
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,520
national exclusive.

591
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,560
Only I sell it.

592
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,280
And I only do online now.

593
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,719
I haven't started selling it offline.

594
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,439
I'll give you

595
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:05,280
the right to sell it as

596
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,239
a national general agent.

597
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,360
You just need to

598
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:10,679
give me the money for the sample.

599
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,080
I'll help you

600
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,320
make money.

601
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:14,800
Jun.

602
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,399
You don't have to

603
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:19,679
give me this chance.

604
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:22,040
But today

605
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,919
I want you

606
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,959
to help me.

607
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,199
Hello.

608
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:40,320
Let me tell you.

609
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,800
This exercise book is really useful.

610
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,199
My child

611
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,080
has made great progress in English

612
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,239
after doing these exercises.

613
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:45,600
I mean it.

614
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,399
Hello.

615
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,399
Have some fruits.

616
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,600
Hello,

617
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,239
everyone.

618
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,080
I am Xiongxiong's mother.

619
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,000
I just moved here.

620
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,159
My name is Xu Mengxin.

621
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:56,840
I want to

622
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,560
ask you how to

623
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,120
educate children

624
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,719
to be as excellent

625
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,959
as yours.

626
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,560
You're welcome.

627
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:05,239
First,

628
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,639
thank you for the fruit.

629
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:07,479
You are welcome.

630
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,080
But recently,

631
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,760
we are all cutting back on sugar.

632
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,360
We won't eat this fruit.

633
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,639
It doesn't matter.

634
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,800
We are mothers

635
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,080
for the first time.

636
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,239
So we are all studying.

637
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,399
Let's go.

638
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,800
It's time for our study.

639
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,560
Let's go inside.

640
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,320
Let's go.

641
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Let's go.

642
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,159
Let's go.

643
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,080
They are

644
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,639
just

645
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:30,800
too idle.

646
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,520
They are so hypocritical.

647
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,919
They live tired.

648
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,399
Are you new here?

649
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:36,679
Yeah.

650
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,159
My name is Xu Mengxin.

651
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:38,919
Hello.

652
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,600
Are you also a stay-at-home mom?

653
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,600
No.

654
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,760
I'm not like them.

655
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,760
So your kid?

656
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,639
You had children before marriage too, right?

657
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,080
Who said that?

658
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,639
They said it.

659
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,159
Or

660
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,520
why aren't they with you?

661
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:54,479
What else did they say about me?

662
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,399
You are

663
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,040
an online influencer and gold digger.

664
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,120
You not only gave birth to a child,

665
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,360
but also a second child.

666
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,159
But I don't think

667
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:02,840
reputation is important.

668
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,000
They don't talk to you.

669
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,719
I do.

670
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,080
Nonsense.

671
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,520
I'm legally married, okay?

672
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm not like you.

673
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,560
You...

674
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,120
I...

675
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,560
This exercise book is particularly good.

676
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,760
My child has been doing

677
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,239
this exercise recently.

678
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:16,360
Hello, everyone.

679
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,439
Let me explain it to you.

680
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,800
I didn't give birth before marriage.

681
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,120
I have a husband.

682
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,120
I got a marriage certificate, registered

683
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,159
in the household register.

684
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,800
My husband can't do such a big business

685
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,320
without me.

686
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:28,719
If you don't believe me,

687
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,679
I'll call my husband.

688
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,439
Hello.

689
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,360
Xin.

690
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,159
Dear.

691
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,159
Hurry back.

692
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,199
They think

693
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,360
I'm too young

694
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,000
and I'm

695
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,280
a mistress of you.

696
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:15,639
Lady.

697
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,560
What's wrong with you?

698
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,239
I'm fine. I...

699
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,040
I am a doctor.

700
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,840
Just tell me.

701
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:21,679
Lady.

702
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,479
Lady.

703
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,840
But today

704
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,239
I want you

705
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,840
to help me.

706
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,080
I bought a house.

707
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:38,800
So I am short of money.

708
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,959
I want to borrow some money

709
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,280
to turn around.

710
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,320
All my money is put on my business.

711
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,479
It didn't flow back yet.

712
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,600
Maybe

713
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,760
a few days later?

714
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,639
I'll see what I can do.

715
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:09,760
Director Xu.

716
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,719
You scared me.

717
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,000
Why are you hiding here?

718
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,439
Will the company

719
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,199
lay me off this time?

720
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:21,600
You should

721
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,760
ask yourself.

722
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:25,320
Director Xu.

723
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,679
I always give you trouble.

724
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,520
But if I

725
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,719
lose this job,

726
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,159
I can't afford the rent.

727
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,000
You are not the only one

728
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,719
who can't pay the rent

729
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,040
without a job.

730
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:36,800
But you should

731
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,360
reflect on yourself.

732
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,239
You have been here for almost two years.

733
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,120
But you left too many

734
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,800
loose ends

735
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,040
for everyone else.

736
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,399
No company

737
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,360
can hire you for two years.

738
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,199
You can't even pass probation period.

739
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,560
If you are fired,

740
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,239
you have to accept it.

741
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:01,120
Just go home and sleep.

742
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
Well. Director Xu.

743
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:21,040
Hello.

744
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:21,959
I sent you

745
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:22,600
the progress of our real estate project

746
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
this month.

747
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,000
Indoor wall

748
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,760
and basic interior finish

749
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,159
has been completed 50%.

750
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:28,199
Aluminum wall

751
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,080
is also half installed.

752
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,800
Your house

753
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,120
is expected to be delivered in advance.

754
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,199
Honey.

755
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,280
How do you think?

756
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,360
Pretty good.

757
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,239
We choose

758
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,439
this one, okay?

759
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,159
I think it's good.

760
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,760
Its location is also good,

761
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,040
and it is close to our mother's place.

762
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,239
Yeah.

763
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,199
Just a little expensive.

764
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,159
It's

765
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,479
beyond our budget, right?

766
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,919
Yeah.

767
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,000
But we can scrape up

768
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,280
the down payment.

769
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,280
That means we need to scrape by in the future.

770
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,080
Let's discuss it with him.

771
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,199
We cancel the decoration.

772
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,760
Let's decorate ourselves.

773
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,760
Okay.

774
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:17,040
Good.

775
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
No big deals

776
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,239
buying a house anyway.

777
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,679
We need to work hard

778
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,399
in the first few years.

779
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,360
But we get all

780
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,439
we want for a house.

781
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,760
Well.

782
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:32,159
I will repay

783
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,800
the loan.

784
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,800
I'll do the rest.

785
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,560
Yunjie.

786
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:37,600
How do you think?

787
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:38,560
Excellent.

788
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,799
Let's buy this one.

789
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,799
I like this big terrace so much.

790
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,239
Mr. Li.

791
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:51,440
Your loan account

792
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,239
is overdue.

793
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,880
Please deposit enough funds

794
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,679
into your account in time.

795
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:55,440
Your credit record will be affected

796
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,080
if it exceeds ten days.

797
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,199
Honey.

798
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:24,560
You're back.

799
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,040
What's Yunjie doing?

800
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,239
Doing homework.

801
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,440
Did the salesgirl send you

802
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,199
the progress of our new house today?

803
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,880
I haven't seen it yet.

804
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,199
I saw it.

805
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:37,960
It's good.

806
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,359
Really?

807
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,359
It can be delivered in advance.

808
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,199
In advance?

809
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,400
Why so quick?

810
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,719
But what about

811
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,560
the quality,

812
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,319
all good?

813
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,759
Sure.

814
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,719
That's great.

815
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,239
What do you want to decorate it?

816
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,000
You have an idea?

817
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,440
Sure.

818
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,839
Go ahead.

819
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,880
I want to

820
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:02,679
decorate it better.

821
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,839
Should be different

822
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,960
from this style.

823
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,639
Nordic style or modern style.

824
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,839
It makes it more spacious.

825
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:10,880
Well.

826
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,639
Why don't we go to

827
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,719
the building materials market some day?

828
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,120
OK.

829
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,920
Agreed.

830
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,359
OK.

831
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:17,960
Have you had nightmares recently?

832
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:20,319
No.

833
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,520
You have nightmares?

834
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,440
Always.

835
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,199
And I keep sweating.

836
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,359
I'm not sure I am going through

837
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,159
menopause recently.

838
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:28,920
Don't talk nonsense.

839
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
You are

840
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,839
young.

841
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:32,239
Don't be paranoid.

842
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
Honey.

843
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,920
You just

844
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,839
have too much pressure at work recently.

845
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,440
You are a little anxious.

846
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,679
So, don't think so.

847
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,960
Take it easy.

848
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,159
Drink a glass of milk

849
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,319
before going to bed

850
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,480
to calm the nerves.

851
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:48,960
What if it doesn't work?

852
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,199
Let our brother-in-law get some medicine

853
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,480
to recuperate.

854
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,239
Don't worry.

855
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,080
I also think it's a little early

856
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,920
to be in menopause.

857
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,520
Way early.

858
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,040
Alright.

859
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:17,679
Look.

860
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,759
Look.

861
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,560
He sent it to my home.

862
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,799
I can't explain it to my mother

863
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,080
if she sees it.

864
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,159
Husky and School Beauty's Partner

865
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,159
has been serialized again.

866
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,080
What School Beauty?

867
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,920
I am the joke of the whole class now.

868
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,560
Don't laugh.

869
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,120
Aren't you friend of mine?

870
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,839
That's

871
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,239
signature pillow of the city's champion.

872
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,359
I can read his thoughts.

873
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,560
I don't want his stuff.

874
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,120
I had better not have anything

875
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,239
to do with him.

876
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:30,560
You are awake.

877
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,040
How long have I slept?

878
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,359
Your hypoglyc-emia,

879
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,600
coupled with fatigue,

880
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,440
gave you a long sleep.

881
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,159
Can I go now?

882
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,279
Just a moment.

883
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,960
Dr. Yu asked you to wait for him.

884
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,400
Dr. Yu?

885
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,120
What about the patient in Bed 3?

886
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,839
She has already left.

887
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,880
Left?

888
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:23,359
Go ahead.

889
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,799
What?

890
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:29,960
Oh, no.

891
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,480
I've only been gone for a short time,

892
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,199
and it's changed so much.

893
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:33,799
Oh, no.

894
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:35,319
Did you call Mr. Liu?

895
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,799
It's signed?

896
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:39,719
All right, hang up.

897
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,480
What's the matter with you?

898
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,040
Why don't you answer the phone?

899
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,239
I wasn't feeling well.

900
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,279
Not feeling well?

901
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:54,679
I'm not feeling well.

902
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,639
Why didn't you pick up

903
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,440
the children this afternoon?

904
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,440
I went to hospital.

905
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,159
Same old ailment.

906
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:00,960
That's not

907
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
an emergency.

908
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:03,319
Nothing is more important

909
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:04,639
than children.

910
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,440
The teacher called me

911
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,759
and said two children

912
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,839
were long waiting for us.

913
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,040
You didn't answer the phone.

914
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,159
So she called me.

915
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,080
I'm in a meeting to negotiate.

916
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,000
Do you know?

917
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,040
You just said

918
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,799
nothing is more important

919
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:17,880
than children.

920
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:18,920
Well.

921
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,560
You've got me.

922
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,120
I suggested hiring a nanny

923
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,279
to take care of the children for you.

924
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,880
You said you could do it yourself.

925
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,319
But you didn't.

926
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,359
What else

927
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,560
can you do?

928
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,960
Forget it.

929
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,719
I will stay in a hotel tonight.

930
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,279
Drink the milk

931
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,719
to help you sleep.

932
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,520
I brushed my teeth.

933
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,040
Drink it first.

934
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,159
Good for you.

935
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,639
Then brush your teeth again.

936
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,679
That's easy.

937
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:08,560
Well.

938
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:12,560
You've been tired all day.

939
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,560
Let me give you a massage.

940
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:24,719
Dad, you are so handsome today.

941
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:25,920
He has been handsome

942
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,000
recently.

943
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,719
What for?

944
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,199
You decided to tell me?

945
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:35,960
Tell you what?
