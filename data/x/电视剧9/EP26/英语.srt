3
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,520
Linlin,

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,960
are you mad?

5
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,479
Linlin,

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,120
don't be angry, okay?

7
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,400
Can't I be angry?

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,439
Look at you.

9
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,400
You have a home,

10
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,479
but you're out here sleeping on the floor.

11
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,240
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,360
Do you not know

13
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,599
how old you are?

14
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,279
Do you not know

15
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,240
your situation?

16
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,599
The floor is so damp.

17
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,680
If you get sick sleeping on the ground,

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
how to tell my brother-in-law about this?

19
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,439
If you're going out to work,

20
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,439
no one's stopping you, right?

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,599
But you need to come home to sleep, okay?

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,879
Isn't...

23
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,159
Look! Look at me!

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,120
Isn't my place your home too?

25
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,279
Am I not your brother?

26
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,319
Li Lin!

27
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:47,839
What?

28
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,279
Am I wrong?

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,039
Whether you're right or wrong,

30
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,319
can't you just say it nicely?

31
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
What are you doing?

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,439
Don't look at me,

33
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,200
look at the road!

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
Your face was all twisted with anger.

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,879
Stop being so grumpy.

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
Can't you speak nicely?

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,759
If you care about your sister,

38
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,480
just tell her,

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,920
"Sister, I care about you."

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Is it so hard to say something honest?

41
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,920
Aren't we all family?

42
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,680
Always like this.

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,719
Nothing.

44
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,200
You're just spoiling him.

45
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,080
Watch how I'll deal with him

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,999
when we get home tonight.

47
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,400
Wanwan,

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,839
Have you finished your homework?

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,680
Yes,

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
but Zhenzhen still has a little left.

51
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,960
Do you need to sign it?

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,520
Yes.

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,960
Okay. I'll sign it in a bit.

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,520
That's a good idea!

55
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,879
I'm clever, right?

56
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,080
This was Mom's idea.

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,879
So, it's like

58
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,279
a scarecrow

59
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,480
standing on the balcony. ﻿

60
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,759
It can scare away bad guys, right?

61
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,920
That's exactly what Mom said.

62
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,520
Mom said that too?

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,999
See,

64
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,559
your mom and dad are totally in sync,

65
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,120
aren't we?

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,279
What are you talking about?﻿

67
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:16,480
Mom,

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,279
I want dad

69
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,759
to bring us two sets of his clothes.

70
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,439
Alright, it's settled then.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,920
I'll take the clothes over right now.

72
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,319
But, Wan Zhen, don't worry.

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,199
Today

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,840
isn't the designated visiting time,

75
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,439
right?

76
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,399
I'll just

77
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,879
drop the clothes off in the basement

78
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,879
and leave right away.

79
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm heading over now.

80
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,480
Goodbye, Dad!

81
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Goodbye, Dad!

82
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,800
Wanwan, Zhenzhen.

83
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,720
You two told Dad

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,480
that Mom was buying men's clothes?

85
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,519
Yeah.

86
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:44,959
Dad has

87
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,399
a lot of clothes,

88
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,360
so, there's no need to spend money.

89
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,280
It's quite economical.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,240
Exactly.

91
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,040
Zhenzhen,

92
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,600
you didn't finish your homework,

93
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,559
and you called Dad?

94
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,720
Don't forget the teacher needs to sign it.

95
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,600
No rush.

96
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,120
I'll have some fruit first.

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,720
Alright.

98
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,199
Is it good?

99
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,120
Finish it up and get to work.

100
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:09,639
Just grab a couple of clothes

101
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,680
you don't usually wear.

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,439
This suit is easily damaged

103
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,600
by being left outside in the sun.

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,480
Ruined? We just buy another, right?

105
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
We just want people to see

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,079
that there's a strong,

107
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,360
reliable man in the house,

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
so, no one dares to mess with you.

109
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,840
Thanks.

110
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,319
Has something happened

111
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,639
at home recently?

112
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,920
Why the sudden urge to hang up clothes?

113
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,879
No, it's just for precaution.

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,480
Right,

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,879
you've thought ahead.

116
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,959
It's always good to be prepared.

117
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,079
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

118
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,360
Wait,

119
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,160
aside from thinking about the clothes,

120
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,120
don't you think the house

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,280
is also missing someone?

122
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,800
Someone to help out.

123
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,360
The property guys are more helpful.

124
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,879
That's not quite right.

125
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:51,879
You think the property management

126
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,199
can do everything what I can?

127
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,680
Well, can you borrow a work uniform

128
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,559
from the property management

129
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,199
and hang it up there?

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,559
You take it back, and I'll go buy one.

131
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,600
No, no.

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,759
No need to buy one, I'll shut up.

133
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,559
I'm leaving.

134
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,480
Come back.

135
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:04,759
Just to confirm,

136
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,199
can you pick up the kids

137
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,600
an hour earlier next weekend?

138
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,680
I've been quite busy.

139
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,879
The sales peak season, right?

140
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,879
I understand.

141
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,800
I do the same when I'm busy.

142
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,120
Alright,

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,399
I'll arrive an hour and a half earlier,

144
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,120
at 7:30.

145
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Eight o'clock is fine.

146
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,480
Okay,

147
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,240
see you

148
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,559
at eight.

149
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,879
Ms. Chen, what a coincidence.

150
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,639
Dr. Yu.

151
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:25,879
Mr. Yu, what a coincidence.

152
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,079
I won't disturb you.

153
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm going to the gym.

154
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I think you're

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
missing not just

156
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,600
reliable clothes

157
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,280
but also

158
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,840
a reliable man like me.

159
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,959
Having the clothes

160
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,600
is like having me around.

161
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,240
You go up first.

162
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,040
You go.

163
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,120
You go up first.

164
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,840
You go first.

165
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,480
Your car is blocking someone.

166
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:14,840
Come.

167
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,800
Let's hang up

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
dad's clothes, okay?

169
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,600
Okay.

170
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,680
Dad said that

171
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,720
hanging his clothes

172
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,319
is like

173
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,040
having him around,

174
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,360
protecting us.

175
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,720
Yes,

176
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,079
this way,

177
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,360
we'll

178
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,879
feel secure in the future.

179
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Aren't you going to sleep?

180
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,319
I'm hungry.

181
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,680
Big sis's wontons are in the fridge.

182
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
I'll cook them now.

183
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,200
Hungry?

184
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,480
Meng'an is hungry.

185
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,120
I made a bowl for you too.

186
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,039
How is it? Is it enough?

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,639
Should I make another bowl for you?

188
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,759
No, no, no,

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
that's enough.

190
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,960
Eating

191
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,840
such a big bowl at this hour

192
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,999
is already too much.

193
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,519
You're eating for one

194
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,600
but making up for two,

195
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,919
so, don't diet, okay?

196
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,720
We'll diet after the baby is born.

197
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,600
Don't worry,

198
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,080
I have a family recipe.

199
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,080
Okay,

200
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I trust you.

201
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,799
I was originally thinking

202
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,080
that if you left,

203
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,240
I would find another reason

204
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,399
to bring you back.

205
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,360
But to my surprise,

206
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
you never left...

207
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,600
Look at you.

208
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,799
I understand you're specializing in

209
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,799
post-natal care for me.

210
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,879
Thank you, sister.

211
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,080
Look at you,

212
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,919
thank you, thank you, thank you.

213
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,840
Aren't we family?

214
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,279
Besides,

215
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,360
I was just idle

216
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,840
and decided to learn to post-natal care.

217
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,399
It's not just for you.

218
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,519
I also want to make some money.

219
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,240
Okay,

220
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
I won't delay your business.

221
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,120
Yes.

222
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,360
Don't take it yet, sis.

223
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,879
I have something to tell you.

224
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,840
Do you

225
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,399
remember when Li Lin and I

226
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,240
were buying this house,

227
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,039
we were short of some money.

228
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,679
It was you who helped us.

229
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,840
That wasn't me,

230
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,799
that was dad.

231
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,159
The money he left for your wedding.

232
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,720
Don't lie to me.

233
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,039
Even though I never met dad,

234
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,759
I still know.

235
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,320
Dad was sick for so long,

236
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
so, there couldn't be any money left.

237
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,360
That money was all borrowed.

238
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,440
That was that year

239
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,560
when Li Lin and I

240
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,320
went home for the holidays.

241
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,399
Someone came

242
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,999
to collect a debt from my brother-in-law.

243
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,519
That's how we found out.

244
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:03,320
Later, my brother-in-law said

245
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,519
you all paid it back over several years.

246
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
Look at Mr. Ouyang,

247
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,960
chattering like

248
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,159
an old woman,

249
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,039
saying everything out loud.

250
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,679
Let me tell you,

251
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,600
when dad passed away,

252
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,399
he left the clinic to him.

253
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,919
So, when my brother's buying an apartment,

254
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,240
it's only right for me

255
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
to take some money.

256
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,799
Yes,

257
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,999
you are right.

258
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,279
Later, I told Li Lin

259
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,560
to give the money back to you.

260
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,279
He said you definitely wouldn't accept it,

261
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,480
so, I said that this apartment

262
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,879
should be considered as a share for you.

263
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,600
So,

264
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,200
this is your home,

265
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,480
and you can

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
live here confidently.

267
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,879
Next time if you get angry again,

268
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
just kick him out,

269
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,240
but you can't leave again.

270
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,279
If you leave,

271
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,639
I'll be really upset,

272
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,320
you know?

273
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,120
Well,

274
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,919
I leave these bowls here.

275
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,759
Hurry up

276
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,879
and rest.

277
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,759
Once you're done,

278
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,759
go to bed quickly.

279
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,960
Is that okay?

280
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,399
Thank you.

281
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:38,480
Li Lin,

282
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,399
breakfast is ready.

283
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,320
Auntie,

284
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,240
I love fried dumplings the most,

285
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
especially with meat filling.

286
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,999
I need to eat more meat,

287
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:46,399
or else

288
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,679
my brain doesn't work well in class.

289
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,039
Alright, alright, here,

290
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,560
have another one.

291
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,399
Eat a bit more.

292
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,159
Whether your brain works or not

293
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,759
is not related to the meat.

294
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,919
It's just that you love eating it.

295
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,879
Your aunt,

296
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,919
it's not that I can't cook meat dishes.

297
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,200
I just think

298
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,639
eating too much at night

299
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,560
is not healthy,

300
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,600
you know?

301
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
In the future,

302
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,279
let's make our breakfasts

303
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,519
more substantial,

304
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,039
right?

305
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,159
Traditional Chinese medicine says that

306
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
breakfast should

307
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,879
be like a king's feast,

308
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:18,560
lunch should

309
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,480
be more modest,

310
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,799
and dinner should be like a beggar's meal.

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,120
Got it?

312
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,039
So now we're

313
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,360
all like queens.

314
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:28,919
Come on!

315
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:29,999
Meng'an,

316
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,080
come try this beef.

317
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,399
I just braised last night.

318
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,279
Okay.

319
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,840
What a sumptuous breakfast!

320
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,799
It seems like that our sister

321
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,320
has learned a lot

322
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,399
from Lanxiang

323
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,360
for our family's breakfasts.

324
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,360
What?

325
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,399
I learned from Lanxiang?

326
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,519
Are you serious?

327
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,759
Those recipes from Lanxiang

328
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,560
were actually taught by me.

329
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,960
Are you kidding?

330
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,519
You...

331
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,999
Oh.

332
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,960
Oh right, I forgot.

333
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:58,720
Lanxiang's cooking

334
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,840
used to be

335
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,480
so rough,

336
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,919
right?

337
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,159
Yes.

338
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,600
I remember,

339
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:02,919
you taught her how to

340
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,360
make the stir-fry and dumplings.

341
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,879
Yes!

342
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:06,720
So how can you say

343
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,960
I learned from her?

344
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
I forgot!

345
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Auntie,

346
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,679
I wanna eat fermented glutinous rice buns.

347
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,360
Can you make them?

348
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,080
Yes, I can.

349
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,080
Just wait,

350
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,120
You'll have them

351
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,279
tomorrow morning.

352
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,879
Yeah!

353
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,120
Haowen.

354
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,080
Here, try this.

355
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,480
Really?

356
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,759
Okay, I'll go.

357
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,799
Just take care of Xin.

358
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,320
You don't need to worry about it.

359
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,720
What's wrong? Is there something?

360
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,200
Xiongxiong has a fever

361
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,919
and might need to go to the hospital.

362
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,960
Haowen is afraid that his grandma

363
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,159
won't be able to handle it alone,

364
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,159
so, he asked me to go and take a look.

365
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,279
Isn't he taking care of Xin?

366
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,399
I'll go with you.

367
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,399
Okay.

368
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,999
No, neither of you can go.

369
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,840
I just took a leave.

370
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,919
I wasn't planning to

371
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,039
go to the prenatal class anyway.

372
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,679
I figured it's okay not to go.

373
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,799
It's not just that.

374
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,759
You're pregnant now.

375
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,159
If Xiongxiong

376
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,039
has the flu,

377
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,320
what if you catch it too?

378
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,120
Then I'll go by myself.

379
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,320
No, you can't go either.

380
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,200
You and Meng'an

381
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,679
are together all the time.

382
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,440
If you get infected,

383
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,960
it's like infecting her too.

384
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,279
Let me go.

385
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,560
I'm familiar with the hospital.

386
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,480
Even if,

387
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,759
I'm saying even if,

388
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,039
it's the flu,

389
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,240
it's okay.

390
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,360
I'll stay at Xin's home for a couple days,

391
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,240
and self-isolate.

392
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,320
It'll be fine.

393
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,320
That's fine then.

394
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
It's a lot of trouble for you.

395
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,480
Okay,

396
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,639
let's do it this way.

397
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,999
After breakfast,

398
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,440
you take Meng'an to her class.

399
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,399
You can take He Lu's car to school,

400
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,720
and I'll take a Uber

401
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
to take Xiongxiong to the hospital.

402
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,759
We'll split up

403
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,759
and handle our own tasks.

404
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,320
The arrangements are perfect.

405
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,360
Yes.

406
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,159
If you hadn't arranged it this way,

407
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,560
we'd probably be a mess.

408
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,360
Leave the household matters

409
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,480
to me,

410
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,759
you can just rest assured.

411
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,039
Hurry up, hurry up.

412
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:06,799
Reassured!

413
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,560
Hurry up, hurry up.

414
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,159
After we finish eating, let's act quickly.

415
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,080
Come on,

416
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,360
Hurry up.

417
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,999
Okay, okay,

418
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,360
thank you, sis.

419
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,919
Eat some meat.

420
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,080
Eat more beef.

421
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:20,879
Sure.

422
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:21,800
It's high-quality protein,

423
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,600
you know?

424
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,239
Here, sweetheart, have some too.

425
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,760
Come on.

426
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,000
Eat up.

427
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,879
Thank you, auntie.

428
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:29,560
Come on.

429
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:50,959
Hello.

430
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,479
Why are you coming here?

431
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm to pick up the child for the doctor.

432
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,919
Thanks.

433
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,080
Xiongxiong will come out soon.

434
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,879
By the way,

435
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,760
the driver is stuck in traffic

436
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,399
and it'll take another 20 mins or so.

437
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,879
Is there a car at home?

438
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,840
There is a car,

439
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,399
but who will drive?

440
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,479
I will.

441
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,320
Xiongxiong, don't be afraid.

442
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,360
Listen to the doctor at the hospital.

443
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,360
You'll get better soon.

444
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,120
Yes.

445
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,159
Li Jing,

446
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,239
I heard you used to be

447
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,639
a head nurse, right?

448
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,239
Yes, I was a head nurse.

449
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,919
Um...

450
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,520
is he still feverish?

451
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:32,639
When he

452
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:33,159
came out just now,

453
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,479
his temperature was

454
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,679
thirty-eight point six degrees.

455
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:37,959
That's pretty high.

456
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,840
Yes.

457
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
Does his stomach hurt?

458
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,080
He's been vomiting and having diarrhea.

459
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,399
What did you give him to eat?

460
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,560
Grandma bought me ice cream.

461
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,399
Aren't you

462
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,479
crying and shouting for ice cream.

463
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,040
This child just won't listen.

464
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,520
Alright, I understand now.

465
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,600
It might be a stomach flu.

466
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,679
It's okay,

467
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,479
at the hospital,

468
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:06,959
maybe a drip will do the trick.

469
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,479
That's good.

470
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,520
Li Jing,

471
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:13,600
I really want to thank you

472
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,199
for today.

473
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,679
We truly owe you a lot.

474
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,080
I'm glad to help.

475
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,199
We're family, right?

476
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:21,679
Yes, exactly.

477
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,239
I know.

478
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
You're taking care of the kids,

479
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,919
and it's a big responsibility.

480
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,520
Yes.

481
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,199
We shouldn't add trouble to them,

482
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:30,639
right?

483
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,919
Absolutely right.

484
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:34,040
It's really hard to

485
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,439
handle a child this age.

486
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,199
You need to set rules for him.

487
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,639
You can't let him

488
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:39,959
do whatever he wants.

489
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:40,679
Right, right.

490
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,280
Did you hear that?

491
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
No more cold drinks in the future.

492
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,439
Did you hear that?

493
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,719
Yes.

494
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,159
Good boy.

495
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:49,879
This child is pitiful.

496
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:58,919
Lanxiang,

497
00:19:58,919 --> 00:19:59,639
don't give her

498
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,520
any more pork trotter soup.

499
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,199
Keep the diet lighter, okay?

500
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,320
I'll call

501
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,600
Mr. Ouyang right away

502
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,000
and ask him to change the recipe.

503
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,840
I guarantee it'll be fine.

504
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:10,879
Okay.

505
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,560
Once he sends the recipe,

506
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,159
I'll send it to you via WeChat.

507
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,320
Alright, that's settled.

508
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:22,879
﻿You're coming.

509
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:25,959
How is it?

510
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,479
Last night,

511
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,159
he didn't sleep well at all.

512
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,239
It's okay.

513
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,679
Let him sleep a bit longer.

514
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,520
We're not

515
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:35,919
in a hurry.

516
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,360
By the way,

517
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,719
let me tell you

518
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:39,800
about this medicine.

519
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,320
Look,

520
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,800
this one is for reducing fever.

521
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,439
It should only be taken

522
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,760
if the fever reaches 38.5°C or higher.

523
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:48,080
Okay?

524
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,439
If it does,

525
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,199
give him one packet.

526
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,159
Okay.

527
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,479
This one is for digestion,

528
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,520
he should take it

529
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,399
three times a day before meals.

530
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:57,840
Okay.

531
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,679
Okay?

532
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Okay, okay.

533
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,679
Besides medicine and injections,

534
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,959
you also need to watch your diet.

535
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,679
Make sure the diet stays light,

536
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,360
especially with the changing season.

537
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,919
Many kids have gastrointestinal illnesses.

538
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,159
You must pay attention.

539
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,040
Okay, okay.

540
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:13,679
Li Jing.

541
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,040
Thanks again for coming today.

542
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,679
I really didn't know what to do

543
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,239
if you hadn't come.

544
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,199
I'm always confused

545
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,399
when I get to the hospital.

546
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,719
And the nanny at home

547
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,040
isn't reliable.

548
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,320
Thank you, really.

549
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,520
It's nothing.

550
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,399
We're family,

551
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:31,840
right?

552
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,520
Yes, yes.

553
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,199
It's my pleasure to help you.

554
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,879
Please don't be so formal with me.

555
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:37,879
Thank you, thank you.

556
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,239
I'll take a look.

557
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,320
That child is crying a lot,

558
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,959
probably due to digestive issues.

559
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll go check on him.

560
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,000
Sister,

561
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,760
I know.

562
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,320
Recently, everyone's been out of sorts.

563
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,040
Okay, okay.

564
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,040
We'll have another one

565
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,560
in a few days.

566
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:09,199
Okay, sister.

567
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,959
You go ahead and handle things.

568
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,239
Okay, okay.

569
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,360
Honey,

570
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,439
they are too busy,

571
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,520
so, I told her not to come.

572
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,360
It was already a rescheduled event,

573
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,239
and you insisted on choosing a weekday.

574
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,560
Sister and brother-in-law are so busy,

575
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,040
who has time to come?

576
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,520
Honey, it's really my fault.

577
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,000
I was only thinking about picking a date.

578
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
I've been so mixed up

579
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,439
with this maternity leave.

580
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:30,959
It's all for me?

581
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,479
Accompanying me on maternity leave

582
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,959
delayed your important matter.

583
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,280
Honey, don't say that.

584
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,520
I wouldn't dare.

585
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:37,399
How about this,

586
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,040
when our little baby

587
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,199
turns 100 days old,

588
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,120
we'll make it up with a big celebration,

589
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
book a big hotel,

590
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,040
a five-star one,

591
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,479
and hold a big celebration party

592
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,320
with a sense of ceremony.

593
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,239
Is that okay?

594
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,439
How's Xiongxiong doing?

595
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,679
It's just gastroenteritis,

596
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,679
and the fever is almost gone.

597
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,399
How did he get gastroenteritis?

598
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:55,639
What did mom give him to eat?

599
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,280
The issue is that he's staying at

600
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,360
his grandma's and granny's alternately.

601
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,719
and no one keeps an eye on him.

602
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,840
It's unclear how it happened.

603
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,040
Are you blaming my mom?

604
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,159
You mean my mom gave him the wrong thing?

605
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,239
Honey,

606
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:07,239
I really didn't mean it that way.

607
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:07,919
I...

608
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,120
The teachers told me that

609
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,800
several of his classmates

610
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,280
have gastroenteritis too.

611
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:13,959
It's a seasonal issue.

612
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:14,879
Enough of this,

613
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,679
I'm going to sleep.

614
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,479
Okay,

615
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,159
okay,

616
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:19,080
let's cover the quilt tightly.

617
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:20,560
Honey,

618
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,199
Honey,

619
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,520
I want to say,

620
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
I'm really happy

621
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,760
about just the two of us.

622
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:46,520
They are not coming

623
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,679
is just what I wanted.

624
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,520
It's perfect.

625
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:49,760
This is our time.

626
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,760
Aren't you planning

627
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,560
a party for your little sweetheart?

628
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:54,919
Honey,

629
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,479
The nanny takes care of Little Watermelon.

630
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,679
You're still the most important, honey.

631
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,520
In my heart, it's only you, not her.

632
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:03,159
You need to believe that my feelings

633
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,120
are genuine.

634
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,879
Honey,

635
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,800
you are the most, most, most,

636
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,000
most amazing woman in my heart.

637
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:12,600
Come on.

638
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,000
I miss Xiongxiong.

639
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:16,879
It's okay,

640
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,879
once Xiongxiong gets better,

641
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:18,959
I'll bring him over and sleep together,

642
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,360
the three of us.

643
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,360
Come on.

644
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:25,959
It's okay.

645
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,760
Who's here, so disappointment?

646
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,239
I'm coming.

647
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,800
Xu Mengxin's daughter.

648
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,040
The result of the hearing screening

649
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,360
is out.

650
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,560
She still failed the left ear test.

651
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:43,840
What should we do?

652
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:44,800
Wait

653
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:45,719
until the hundred-day mark

654
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,120
and go to a big hospital for a follow-up.

655
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,879
Okay, okay.

656
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
Here's the report.

657
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,600
What should we do?

658
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,679
Little Watermelon is a girl.

659
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,600
If she has hearing problems

660
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,320
and needs to wear a hearing aid,

661
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,320
it will be so ugly.

662
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,600
Honey,

663
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:29,679
don't worry.

664
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,360
The doctor said

665
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,320
there are multiple possibilities

666
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,439
in the current testing process.

667
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,000
He said it's possible

668
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,919
that the ear canal

669
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,679
might be blocked with

670
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,360
earwax since the baby was just born.

671
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:37,919
Also, last time she

672
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,000
couldn't hear in both ears,

673
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,120
but now one ear is fine.

674
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,159
Isn't that a good thing?

675
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:41,959
No,

676
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,639
not at all.

677
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,000
Honey,

678
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,000
don't be upset.

679
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:51,879
Here,

680
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,600
honey,

681
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,000
look at this little cake,

682
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,679
isn't it nice?

683
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,479
It even has flowers.

684
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,439
Sweets will cheer you up.

685
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,159
Have a bite, open your mouth.

686
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,320
I'm not in the mood to eat.

687
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,360
Have a bite.

688
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,879
I'm coming.

689
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,320
I'm coming.

690
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,399
Dad.

691
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,239
Mom.

692
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,320
It's you.

693
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,719
Look at her little mouth.

694
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,479
Uncle, Auntie,

695
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,679
I'll first take the baby for a bath.

696
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,159
Okay, okay.

697
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:36,600
This little girl.

698
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,360
Be gentle.

699
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,439
Haowen,

700
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,760
aren't you going to accompany your baby?

701
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,800
Or you take me

702
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,679
to the bath area.

703
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,199
I need to keep an eye on the baby.

704
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:51,959
The baby's ears

705
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,199
can't get wet.

706
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,000
It's fine, mom.

707
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,399
Just stay here

708
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:56,439
and chat with Xin.

709
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,719
Dad hasn't seen Xin for a month, yet.

710
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:58,679
I'll go.

711
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,159
You go?

712
00:26:59,159 --> 00:26:59,600
I'll go, I'll go.

713
00:26:59,600 --> 00:26:59,959
Trust me.

714
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,239
Okay, keep an eye on her.

715
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,679
Okay.

716
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,320
Dad,

717
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,159
don't stand there, sit down.

718
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:17,600
Slow down, slow down.

719
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:28,239
I'm sorry.

720
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,479
It's not your fault.

721
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:36,199
It's my fault.

722
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,120
I made you so angry like this.

723
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,919
I'm sorry.

724
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,040
It's okay,

725
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:44,959
I'm happy.

726
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:49,959
I'm sorry, dad.

727
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,840
I'm sorry.

728
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,479
Xin,

729
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:18,520
Xin,

730
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,639
come here, don't cry.

731
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,639
Look,

732
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,120
how is your dad doing?

733
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,560
He seems to be recovering well.

734
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,479
Thanks for all your hard work, Mom.

735
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:32,919
Don't cry, don't cry.

736
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,399
Do you want to try Mom's wontons?

737
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,439
I'll bring them to you tonight.

738
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,080
No need, there's everything here.

739
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,959
No need.

740
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,520
Eating hospital food all the time,

741
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,479
isn't that boring?

742
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,919
Just take care of dad.

743
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
I don't need anything.

744
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,479
It's fine.

745
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,000
Lanxiang is at home.

746
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,919
She's young and capable,

747
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,320
and she's your brother-in-law's relative.

748
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,399
Your mom is enjoying

749
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,919
some peace now.

750
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,919
Really?

751
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,120
I heard that my dad's

752
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,239
rehabilitation is quite troublesome.

753
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,199
It's not troublesome.

754
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:13,560
You know, your dad exercises

755
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,080
at home every day.

756
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,800
The doctors at the community hospital

757
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,199
come to our home for rehabilitation.

758
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:19,760
I'm just supervising

759
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,800
on one side.

760
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,959
Cooking and cleaning

761
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,320
are all done by Lanxiang.

762
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:26,120
We estimate,

763
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,719
by the time you

764
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,040
leave the postpartum care center,

765
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,600
your dad might even

766
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,159
be able to push the stroller

767
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:32,959
around the street.

768
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,439
Strolling with the baby.

769
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,760
Okay, okay.

770
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,360
I'll exercise.

771
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,159
Let me tell you,

772
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,560
I accompany

773
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,280
your dad every day

774
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,439
for a walk.

775
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,919
The doctor says that

776
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,000
walking is good.

777
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,719
Your dad used to

778
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,399
sit at the senior center,

779
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,120
playing cards and chess,

780
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,159
not moving around,

781
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
which easily leads to blood vessel clogs.

782
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
From now on, I'll supervise

783
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
his exercise,

784
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,560
and he's not allowed to eat braised pork

785
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,239
or drink alcohol.

786
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,879
It's okay, it's okay.

787
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:16,800
Don't cry.

788
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,560
What is this?

789
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,120
It's a bracelet,

790
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,000
you wore it when you were little.

791
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,080
I wore it when I was little?

792
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,199
Really?

793
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,719
You wore it when you were born.

794
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,719
This.

795
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,159
It was when you were about this big.

796
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,639
I wore it when I was little.

797
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:46,919
Let me tell you,

798
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,280
When you were just born,

799
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,520
just like

800
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
this Little Watermelon now,

801
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,000
you were also premature.

802
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,639
But you were born

803
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:53,840
in winter,

804
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,840
it was cold,

805
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
and you swallowed some amniotic fluid,

806
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,719
which made you cough and have a fever.

807
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,479
You're such a little one,

808
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,439
to take much medicine.

809
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:05,760
Your dad

810
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,320
is from the North,

811
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,439
and they believe that

812
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,239
if you wrap a red string

813
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,520
around the bracelet

814
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,479
and put it on the baby's foot,

815
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,120
it helps

816
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,399
prevent illness.

817
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:16,959
You know what,

818
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
it actually worked.

819
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,399
Not sure if you had

820
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,399
reached 100 days by then,

821
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:20,840
but

822
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,639
once you put that on,

823
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,719
no coughing and the fever cleared up.

824
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
Right, Xu?

825
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,159
Useful.

826
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,399
Let me tell you,

827
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,800
later,

828
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,040
you put this on Little Watermelon too.

829
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,239
Next time around,

830
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,600
maybe her left ear will work just fine.

831
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,560
Thank you, dad.

832
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,439
Great, then no sickness and no trouble,

833
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,679
warding off all illnesses.

834
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,360
Thank you, mom.

835
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,800
Congratulations,

836
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,959
you've reached three months,

837
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,239
you can set up your medical records now.

838
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,679
At your age,

839
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,080
you're considered a high-risk pregnancy.

840
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't feel anything,

841
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,280
why is it high-risk?

842
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,040
Age makes your pregnancy high-risk.

843
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
You've had to get pregnancy support twice.

844
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,280
Isn't that high-risk?

845
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,080
Be careful.

846
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,399
Age doesn't spare anyone.

847
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,280
My health is fine.

848
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:37,959
I conceived naturally.

849
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,639
Yes, yes,

850
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:40,800
you're the pregnant one,

851
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,879
you're always right.

852
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,199
Look,

853
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,719
your blood lipids and blood pressure.

854
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:49,040
Age slows down your metabolism.

855
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,679
so, you have to control your diet.

856
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,479
You should attend the prenatal class.

857
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,600
It's about dietary nutrition today.

858
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,679
Make sure to learn well.

859
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:58,760
Can I not go?

860
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,800
No,

861
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:01,239
if you don't attend the prenatal training,

862
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,320
we won't set up medical records for you.

863
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,080
Just go and learn,

864
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,159
it won't hurt.

865
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,199
Take this.

866
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,719
Now, regarding pregnancy nutrition,

867
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,919
let's compare it

868
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,560
with a simple dietary pyramid.

869
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,199
During pregnancy,

870
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,800
as for cooking oil,

871
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,840
usually,

872
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,760
25 g oil and 6 g salt for the whole day.

873
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,600
How much is

874
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
25 grams of oil?

875
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Let's take a look

876
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
at our model.

877
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:29,120
This amount of oil is 25 grams.

878
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,879
During pregnancy,

879
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:31,479
the intake of oil and salt is controlled,

880
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,639
just 25 grams a day.

881
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,560
Oil

882
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,479
has a high-calorie content,

883
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,080
and this is the amount of oil for one day.

884
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,040
As for salt,

885
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,000
it's 6 grams per day.

886
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,399
Do you know

887
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:40,959
how much 6 grams of salt is?

888
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,600
Let me introduce everyone

889
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,760
to our new

890
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,320
Deputy Director of Content Center,

891
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Huang Sisi.

892
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,479
Hello everyone,

893
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,919
I'm happy to join Xinmiao,

894
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,479
and I'm excited to work together.

895
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,080
Please take care of me.

896
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,479
Where's Meng'an?

897
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,600
Not on leave for pregnancy again?

898
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,959
How could that be?

899
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,120
Director Xu will be here soon.

900
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,040
Rachel,

901
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,880
please show Sisi around

902
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,159
around the office.

903
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:21,880
Okay.

904
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,080
Hello.

905
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm Ling Meichuan.

906
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,440
I've heard of you for a long time,

907
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,960
a Top 10 Tech Woman.

908
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,319
You're truly remarkable,

909
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,319
and I want to learn from you.

910
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,719
Deputy Director Ling.

911
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,199
Yes, yes.

912
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,639
Hello, hello.

913
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,120
I've seen you before, haven't I?

914
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,159
You're the one

915
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,759
who participated

916
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,199
in the same event as Director Xu, right?

917
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,120
Yes.

918
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,600
Yes,

919
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,520
a Top 10 Tech Woman,

920
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,920
just like Director Xu.

921
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,000
You're too kind, too kind.

922
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,920
Hello,

923
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm at the mall.

924
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,359
Why aren't

925
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,719
your supervisors here?

926
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,639
How can I ensure

927
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,000
the accuracy of the data?

928
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,920
Have them come back immediately.

929
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,839
Are you from the client company?

930
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,040
Yes, that's right.

931
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,480
The strict boss lady

932
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,560
they're talking about in the group.

933
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,120
Exactly,

934
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:32,040
that's me.

935
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,679
I need data from 9 a.m.

936
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,000
to 9 p.m.,

937
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,920
but you were off-duty

938
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,000
for such a long time.

939
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,400
We were only gone for a short while.

940
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,120
Besides,

941
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,319
today is a workday

942
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,679
and there are fewer commercial demands.

943
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,560
This kind of mother and baby product

944
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,359
targets

945
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,600
full-time moms,

946
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:47,799
so, it doesn't matter whether

947
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:49,080
it's a workday or a weekend.

948
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,279
You were off-duty for over an hour.

949
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:52,120
How can you provide me

950
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,480
with the most accurate real-time data?

951
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,120
Just head-counting, huh?

952
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,759
Why make it sound so grand?

953
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,199
You're finance

954
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,560
or economics students, right?

955
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,880
You should understand

956
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,120
the importance of data.

957
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,880
Only the most accurate data

958
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,799
can lead to the most precise judgments.

959
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
Don't you get that?

960
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Let me put it this way, madam.

961
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,839
After graduation,

962
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,120
I didn't know what I wanted to do,

963
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,480
but I definitely didn't want to do

964
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,880
this kind of counting job.

965
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,520
I'm quitting.

966
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,159
What's wrong?

967
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,120
Let me go.

968
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,319
Let him go.

969
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,759
My partner has left,

970
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,480
madam,

971
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,120
will we continue today?

972
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,960
Of course, we'll continue.

973
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:25,719
I'll stay with you.

974
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,279
Okay,

975
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,080
have a seat.

976
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:35,799
By the way,

977
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,359
since you're from the client company,

978
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,080
why are you still out here

979
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,839
counting the number of people?

980
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,359
Many companies

981
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:41,159
now prefer to

982
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,679
outsource this kind of work.

983
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,639
Actually,

984
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,560
When I first started working,

985
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,199
I would personally

986
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,359
go to the shopping mall

987
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,480
to count people and verify the data.

988
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,799
It's not much different

989
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:52,600
from a university graduate

990
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,679
working as a screw-tightener.

991
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,000
But if you have the ability,

992
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:58,880
you wouldn't be doing just that forever.

993
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
If you don't have the ability,

994
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,880
you might not

995
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,839
even do that well.

996
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,920
You're right.

997
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,960
Deputy Director Huang,

998
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,920
you were a director at Blue Ocean

999
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,359
and now you're here as a deputy director.

1000
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,679
You must feel aggrieved.

1001
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,440
Not at all.

1002
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,080
I get along well with Mr. Zhang

1003
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,040
on the business front,

1004
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,639
and I admire Xinmiao's philosophy.

1005
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,679
In this position,

1006
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,400
I think I can add more value.

1007
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,279
I don't know much

1008
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:24,679
about the business side.

1009
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,279
The other day,

1010
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,920
saw your award ceremony live that day.

1011
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,279
Meichuan, you were there, right?

1012
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,319
Yes, I was.

1013
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,719
The scene was packed with people,

1014
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,000
and you and Mr. Yu

1015
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,159
were hugging so tightly

1016
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,199
and couldn't part for a long time.

1017
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,799
Were you trying to prove to everyone

1018
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,400
that you're not together?

1019
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,880
What do you think?

1020
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,480
These are small welcome gifts

1021
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,199
for you two.

1022
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:53,400
I can't accept this.

1023
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,719
It might be considered bribery.

1024
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:55,719
You all carry on.

1025
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,880
Thank you.

1026
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,719
I especially like this brand.

1027
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:02,199
Pick a color yourself.

1028
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,560
I heard that Mr. Zhang loves green tea.

1029
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,319
This is Longjing.

1030
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,040
Try it out.

1031
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,000
Okay.

1032
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:10,880
Thank you.

1033
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,159
Drink it while it's fresh.

1034
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:13,880
What a good tea.

1035
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,359
What's the situation

1036
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,520
with you and Mr. Yu from Blue Ocean now?

1037
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,839
Former boss.

1038
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,520
We have no current relationship.

1039
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,560
Of course,

1040
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,960
he will always be the mentor

1041
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,239
who introduced me to the industry.

1042
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,120
That won't change.

1043
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,279
We've gathered

1044
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
some side information about you,

1045
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,920
and not all of it

1046
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:39,679
is positive.

1047
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,199
So,

1048
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,040
I'm using you under pressure.

1049
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,080
You're a new here,

1050
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,040
so, you should have a sense of crisis.

1051
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,400
I understand.

1052
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,679
Really appreciate your recognition.

1053
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I will bring all

1054
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,440
my resources and value

1055
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,639
to Xinmiao

1056
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,960
to alleviate your pressure.

1057
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,400
As for those reviews,

1058
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,279
I don't care.

1059
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:01,199
I believe

1060
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,520
that represents my influence.

1061
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,719
So, tell me,

1062
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,600
what can you bring to Xinmiao?

1063
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,920
Here's a welcome gift for Xinmiao.

1064
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,359
What's going on?

1065
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:27,839
Oh,

1066
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,040
why did you just get back?

1067
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,199
I was held up by the doctor

1068
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,480
at a maternity class.

1069
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,440
If I couldn't get a stamp there,

1070
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,600
they wouldn't set up a record for me.

1071
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,400
Did you get the stamp?

1072
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,920
Yes, I did.

1073
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:35,960
Me, too.

1074
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,279
Did it happen that quickly?

1075
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,759
She came prepared.

1076
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,199
So where is she?

1077
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,159
She is waiting to meet you

1078
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,480
in your office.

1079
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,080
Director Xu.

1080
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,199
Director Huang.

1081
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,040
Welcome.

1082
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,560
I've been waiting for you.

1083
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:27,960
It's normal.

1084
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,480
Have a seat.

1085
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:32,520
Your office

1086
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,839
has such good lighting.

1087
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:34,839
Mr. Zhang

1088
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,960
left the best room for you.

1089
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,880
It's clear you are

1090
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,799
one of Xinmiao's top talents.

1091
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,600
You're too kind.

1092
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:42,480
It's just that over the years,

1093
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,719
I've been following Mr. Zhang closely

1094
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,799
and receiving some extra care.

1095
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:45,440
That's why

1096
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,880
I rushed to report for duty

1097
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,239
and have the chance to learn from you.

1098
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,279
It's my honor.

1099
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:49,759
I don't dare to claim that.

1100
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:53,679
Congratulations.

1101
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,159
This is for baby.

1102
00:40:58,279 --> 00:40:59,480
How did you find out?

1103
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,880
Who told you that?

1104
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,199
Everyone was talking about it

1105
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,319
when I was starting my job.

1106
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,319
It must have been tough for you

1107
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,319
to prepare gifts in advance.

1108
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,679
I won't disturb you any longer.

1109
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,120
Balance work and rest.

1110
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,040
I will.

1111
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,839
My baby.

1112
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,359
Your mother has a tough time,

1113
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,960
you should be filial to me.

1114
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
This is a survey

1115
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,639
of customer flow and

1116
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,639
sales of infant store of Chunjiang City.

1117
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,319
Take a look.

1118
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:44,679
The maternal and infant industry

1119
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,839
is definitely

1120
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,319
worth investing in,

1121
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:48,920
but in niche markets,

1122
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,960
it still needs clear

1123
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,799
user profiles and product positioning.

1124
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,080
Even though they are all children,

1125
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,199
a year's difference

1126
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
makes a huge impact.

1127
00:41:58,759 --> 00:41:59,319
Yes.

1128
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,799
I believe the early childhood segment

1129
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,920
needs clearer positioning.

1130
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,880
Thanks to Wendy,

1131
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,799
otherwise, we wouldn't

1132
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:07,600
even have children

1133
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,040
to make judgments about.

1134
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,679
So, you should hurry up and get married.

1135
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:12,880
So, let Wendy

1136
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,239
handle this project.

1137
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,799
Wendy has been

1138
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,759
running around

1139
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:17,799
to get the most accurate data,

1140
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:18,560
which is very tough.

1141
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,880
It's not tough.

1142
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,000
There's a milk tea shop

1143
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,839
next to the maternal and infant store.

1144
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,839
I drink milk tea every day

1145
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:23,600
and have gained weight.

1146
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,159
Invoice for company reimbursement.

1147
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:26,839
Wendy,

1148
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,000
are you adapting

1149
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,159
to the work recently?

1150
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:32,960
It's like being in a battle every day,

1151
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,679
but it's fulfilling.

1152
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,120
It feels like going back to

1153
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,239
when I just graduated.

1154
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,440
I've been living like this

1155
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,679
for years.

1156
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,560
In the future,

1157
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:43,159
each day brings more fulfillment.

1158
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,560
Be prepared for that.

1159
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:45,799
Thank you.

1160
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:47,799
So,

1161
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
working so efficiently

1162
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,920
and diligently every day

1163
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,560
is why you have achieved so much today.

1164
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,279
No,

1165
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:56,880
I need to make up

1166
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,480
for the time I lost before.

1167
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,120
Not only will you

1168
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,000
make up for lost time,

1169
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,480
but you'll also become

1170
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,600
the one who runs the farthest

1171
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,080
and lasts the longest.

1172
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:06,799
Why do you say that?

1173
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:07,920
Look,

1174
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,359
Wendy,

1175
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,080
when we started in the industry together,

1176
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,560
it was like

1177
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,960
we were on the same starting line.

1178
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,159
The starting gun fired,

1179
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:16,880
and we all began

1180
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,080
a long-distance race.

1181
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,759
But the financial industry

1182
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,120
requires maintaining a high intensity,

1183
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,600
which is really exhausting.

1184
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,239
In your twenties, your body can handle it,

1185
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:26,839
but thirty-five is a threshold.

1186
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:27,600
Many people

1187
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,279
can't endure it.

1188
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:29,120
Their enthusiasm fades,

1189
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,080
and they leave or change careers.
