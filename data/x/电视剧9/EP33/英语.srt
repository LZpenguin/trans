Just in Time EP33

3
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,622
You cause trouble every day.

4
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:52,583
I simply can't

5
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,359
focus on my work.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,120
Chores, work,

7
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,719
I don't even get a moment

8
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,320
to breathe.

9
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,120
I can't say

10
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm the best husband

11
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,880
in the world,

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,079
but I'm close enough.

13
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,359
For you,

14
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,400
and your family,

15
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,079
I spend money and effort.

16
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,480
You are my top priority.

17
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,999
Your requests,

18
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,559
I try my best to satisfy them.

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,599
But look how you treat me,

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,719
and my family.

21
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,680
Bullying me, I put up with it,

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
but why did you bully my mom?

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,080
I didn't get married

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,559
to put my mom into suffering.

25
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,960
You're a good daughter to your mom.

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
I also want to serve mine right!

27
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,279
Indeed, childbirth is tough.

28
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,039
To make it easier for you,

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,520
I hired a costly nanny.

30
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,080
But you insulted her,

31
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,159
and me.

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,279
You cast shame

33
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,559
on my whole family!

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,559
It's not me. It's postpartum depression

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,759
and I've already seen a therapist,

36
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,319
Haowen.

37
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,839
It's too late.

38
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,360
I...

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,080
I'm too tired!

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,159
Exhausted, really.

41
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,999
I flatter you,

42
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,559
day after day.

43
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:25,800
I praise you,

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,879
and I do everything as you say.

45
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,920
I've lost my dignity.

46
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,439
I've lost myself.

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,999
Days feel too long,

48
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,080
but life is too short.

49
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,999
Do I deserve to live like this?

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,599
Do I?

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,920
Xu Mengxin,

52
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,120
I'm worn out.

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm sick of this.

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
I'll change, Haowen.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I don't want to

56
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,520
keep living like this.

57
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,559
I want to live for myself.

58
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,680
Haowen, Haowen, Haowen!

59
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,920
Think about the kids!

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,279
Haowen!

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,719
Haowen!

62
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,319
Haowen!

63
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,559
Haowen, Haowen!

64
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,040
Haowen,

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
please don't leave me.

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm begging you.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,399
Just let me fix it.

68
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,759
I'll do whatever you say, I...

69
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,559
Hao,

70
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,519
Haowen!

71
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,360
How did you know

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,480
it's my birthday today?

73
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,079
Magic,

74
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,920
I know everything.

75
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,079
Ms Chen Wanzhen,

76
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,399
happy birthday.

77
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,120
Dr. Yu,

78
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
I'd like to thank you

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,559
for these carefully prepared gifts.

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,360
Especially, I want to thank you for

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,040
taking care of my two children.

82
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,600
You don't have to

83
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,439
call me Dr. Yu.

84
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,079
Yu Chen is OK.

85
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,759
I'm used to calling you Dr. Yu.

86
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,079
I just feel that

87
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,199
it makes us seem distant.

88
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,160
Wanzhen,

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
I hope I can become

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,559
someone close to you in your life.

91
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,920
I know

92
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,079
I should be more patient.

93
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:38,920
but I think

94
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,999
we can start as friends.

95
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:40,680
Dr. Yu,

96
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
let's make a wish together.

97
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,040
OK.

98
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,559
Close your eyes,

99
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,800
and imagine the next five or ten years.

100
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,079
What will you be doing?

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,280
What will I be doing?

102
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,319
Close your eyes and think carefully.

103
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,639
I see you

104
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,639
in my future,

105
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,920
and Wanwan and Zhenzhen too.

106
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,680
In ten years,

107
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
I'll be an attending doctor.

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,399
You'll become

109
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,480
a powerful

110
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,600
top-tier manager lady.

111
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,040
We'll be living in a big house,

112
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,519
working hard together

113
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
for our future.

114
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,199
Wanzhen?

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,199
I'm sorry, Dr. Yu.

116
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,079
I'm about to enter

117
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,280
the second half of my life.

118
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,959
I don't want any more changes.

119
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,959
There's not much room

120
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,680
for many people in my future,

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,240
just me and my

122
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,240
Wanwan and Zhenzhen.

123
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
The 32nd Chinese Medical Team

124
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
to assist Africa

125
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,759
is recruiting pediatricians.

126
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,600
The work period is 18 months.

127
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,999
Is anyone signing up?

128
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Pregnancy is so food-consuming!

129
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,879
I don't even know how much

130
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,240
actually benefits the baby.

131
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,080
My weight is surely

132
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,759
shooting up.

133
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Xu Meng'an

134
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,240
Xu Meng'an, come out!

135
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,399
Where are you?

136
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,840
Who's there?

137
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,600
Where are you?

138
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
Xu Meng'an, get out!

139
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,919
What's this shouting all about?

140
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,960
So uncivilized.

141
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,039
Uncivilized?

142
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,399
That's for her!

143
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,519
What's the matter?

144
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,480
Did you

145
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,919
report Xinmiao?

146
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,919
Report?

147
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,320
What happened to Xinmiao?

148
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,200
There has been a talk

149
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,200
that our Xinmiao company

150
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,039
is canceled online for rectification.

151
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,080
Was it you?

152
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,320
Did you report us?

153
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,039
Or did you instruct someone else to do it?

154
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,320
You think it was me, don't you?

155
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:37,919
You were the only one

156
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,639
who opposed the user acquisition plan.

157
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,799
You were the one that

158
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,840
kept saying it was against regulations.

159
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
If it wasn't you, then who?

160
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm the company's content director,

161
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,120
why would I report my own company?

162
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,159
Precisely! Because you're an insider,

163
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,399
you know well how to frame us.

164
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,120
Mr. Zhang,

165
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,399
I kept telling you

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,360
not to challenge the regulations.

167
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,560
But you didn't listen!

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,799
Now that

169
00:10:58,999 --> 00:10:59,679
things went wrong,

170
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,720
do not try to

171
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,399
shift the blame on me!

172
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,840
I do this all for the company!

173
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,440
The company!

174
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,799
You filed the report,

175
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,840
and I don't know why.

176
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,159
Did you want to ruin me?

177
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,240
Or ruin Xinmiao?

178
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,720
All for the company?

179
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,200
You did this only for yourself!

180
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,159
Mr. Zhang, I swear

181
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,360
I didn't file the report.

182
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,560
If someone did report it,

183
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,240
there are too many possible suspects

184
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,799
new users, old users,

185
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,919
and competitor companies.

186
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
For such operations,

187
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,879
a report is a sure thing.

188
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,039
If it were a competitor company,

189
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,080
there must've been an insider,

190
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
leaking the information.

191
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,679
Otherwise, how could they

192
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,360
know so well

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,440
of our business?

194
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,519
Talking about a mole?

195
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,560
Go check with your outsourcing team.

196
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,399
There is a whole room of them.

197
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,799
Deputy Director Huang,

198
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
let's speak with evidence.

199
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,919
That's right, evidence!

200
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,200
Xu Meng'an,

201
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
prove your innocence!

202
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,080
Mr. Zhang,

203
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,960
investigate her.

204
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,840
I apply for a freeze on

205
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,360
all her social media accounts.

206
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Confiscate her phone,

207
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,039
computer and iPad.

208
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,519
And find out

209
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,799
all her personal

210
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,720
social media passwords.

211
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,759
She must be investigated!

212
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,120
My tolerance for you is running out!

213
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,080
What do you want from me?

214
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,360
What do you want?

215
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,080
Easy! Easy!

216
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,399
Director Xu,

217
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,440
for the sake of your fetus!

218
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,240
How dare you hit me?

219
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,440
A pregnant lady needs protection!

220
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,360
Hurry, hurry!

221
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,440
She's pregnant!

222
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,919
That is exactly

223
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,120
why we must stop her!

224
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,080
Come on and try me!

225
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,200
Mr. Zhang, don't!

226
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,639
Mr. Zhang!

227
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,679
Are you alright, Mr. Zhang?

228
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,999
No, thanks.

229
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,240
Just tell me how you plan to deal with me.

230
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,200
What plan?

231
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,720
You...

232
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,679
you gave us

233
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,159
quite a surprise.

234
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,919
You shouldn't have hit her.

235
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,080
If she had fought back,

236
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,560
your fetus,

237
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,360
it would've been a mess!

238
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,480
She wouldn't dare!

239
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,360
She did say something quite offensive.

240
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,600
If it were me, I'd scratch her too.

241
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,519
Oh, just give it a rest.

242
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,560
I told you to stop her,

243
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,080
and you didn't.

244
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,999
Well, you didn't stop her either.

245
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,600
You have let her vent a little.

246
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,519
Vent?

247
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm telling you, if she's injured

248
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,840
and goes to a medical exam,

249
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,919
she might sue you.

250
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,720
Then I'll resign.

251
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,519
She craves my position anyway.

252
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,840
Just give it to her.

253
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,039
You are really

254
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,120
a conversation killer!

255
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
Why are you so temperamental?

256
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,399
I have high pregnancy hormones.

257
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
I still won't let you resign.

258
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,999
Well, I disagree too.

259
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
The contract isn't up yet.

260
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,560
Then I'll take a long leave.

261
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,399
I'm near the time of labor,

262
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,440
and the company is under rectification,

263
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
no need for me to be here.

264
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,960
You still have two deputy directors.

265
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,919
Let them handle it.

266
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,200
Let's discuss it after my maternity leave.

267
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:30,919
Alright, fine.

268
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,360
I...

269
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,999
She has her point.

270
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
No pregnant woman

271
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,480
should go to work every day

272
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,240
and withstand such

273
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
humiliation.

274
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,720
Staying at home with her kid,

275
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,399
this is much better.

276
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:41,999
You,

277
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,759
you just made things worse!

278
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
Well, now you are panicking.

279
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,799
Huang Sisi, she messed up

280
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,200
the whole thing.

281
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,440
I say it is better

282
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,639
to have some evidence.

283
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,360
Right?

284
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,840
You need to prove yourself innocent.

285
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,919
Reputation is vital.

286
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,240
Just go home and rest a few days.

287
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,440
After you are calm down,

288
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,720
please hurry back.

289
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
We all count on you

290
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,320
to deal with this mess.

291
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,159
Let's try something different

292
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,120
in today's rehabilitation training.

293
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,159
To train your coordination,

294
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,399
we'll start learning

295
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,759
the most basic steps

296
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,159
of Chinese dance.

297
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,480
The Yangge dance.

298
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,240
I'll demonstrate first.

299
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,399
In early spring,

300
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,840
four five six seven...

301
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,919
It's a bit difficult.

302
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,480
Oh, I see.

303
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,919
Alright, then we'll

304
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,360
switch to an easier one.

305
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,039
It's super easy.

306
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,039
Now I begin.

307
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,480
One two three four.

308
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,120
That's it!

309
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,759
This will do.

310
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,080
Six seven eight,

311
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,840
two three four, five six seven eight.

312
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,279
Four two three four

313
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,200
five six seven...

314
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,080
Uncle, you feel tired?

315
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,279
Senior, it's too early

316
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,039
to rest now!

317
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,799
Come.

318
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,320
Hold on.

319
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,080
You know

320
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,639
persistence is victory!

321
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,159
Ready? Let's begin.

322
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,080
One two three four.

323
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,960
Good, and five!

324
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,360
Great!

325
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,240
Why don't you teach him?

326
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,480
Are you loafing?

327
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,360
That's right.

328
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,360
Keep it this way.

329
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,960
And four

330
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,999
five six seven eight.

331
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:42,840
Clap your hands! One

332
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,639
two two three four five six seven eight.

333
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,080
That's it.

334
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,639
Three two three four five six seven eight.

335
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,759
Mind the rhythm!

336
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,399
One two three four, five six.

337
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,480
Meng'an.

338
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,560
You're dancing!

339
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,240
Yes.

340
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,999
Do you like it?

341
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:04,759
Yes.

342
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,399
Wow,

343
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,600
why are you back so early?

344
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,840
I take a leave.

345
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,720
You should've rested earlier.

346
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
With your pregnancy,

347
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
rest is a must.

348
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,799
Where is Xin?

349
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,360
She went to see a therapist.

350
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,840
She should've been back by now.

351
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,879
Where did she go?

352
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,519
Harmony is vital for a family.

353
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,440
You cause trouble every day.

354
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,879
I simply can't

355
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,720
focus on my work.

356
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
Why are you two here?

357
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,519
Let me introduce you

358
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,320
to Lili, the blogger.

359
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,679
I'm his wife. Who are you?

360
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,279
Xin, there's a misunderstanding.

361
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,320
Jia Haowen, get out.

362
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,360
Me getting out?

363
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,679
It's you who should leave my husband!

364
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,240
I'm all yours.

365
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,080
Listen,

366
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,960
you're carrying my baby,

367
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,720
our second child.

368
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,999
How could I ever

369
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:56,639
cheat on you?

370
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,600
Impossible!

371
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,759
Are you saying that if I die,

372
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,639
you'll find someone else?

373
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,279
Tell me!

374
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,919
Tell me or you won't get to sleep!

375
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,560
Tell me!

376
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,560
Where are you going?

377
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,240
Work staff.

378
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,999
I'll be right back.

379
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,320
Jia Haowen!

380
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,759
I'll be right back,

381
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,879
honey.

382
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,399
Don't come back!

383
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,840
I can't say

384
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm the best husband in the world,

385
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,600
but I'm close enough.

386
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,800
For you,

387
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,479
and your family,

388
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,000
I spend money and effort.

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,360
You are my top priority.

390
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,520
Your requests,

391
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,000
I try my best to satisfy them.

392
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,600
You're a good daughter to your mom.

393
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,560
I also want to serve my mom right!

394
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,080
Look how you treat my family,

395
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,800
Bullying me, I put up with it,

396
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,280
but why did you bully my mom?

397
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,600
Haowen should come back

398
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,919
and take care of his own daughter.

399
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,919
Don't work anymore.

400
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,080
You are mutton dressed as lamb,

401
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:03,840
pretending to

402
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,280
care about me.

403
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,360
But really, you only care about

404
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,600
your granddaughter.

405
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
How well did she eat,

406
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,520
drink,

407
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,040
and sleep.

408
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,239
It's always about your granddaughter.

409
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,639
Have you ever cared about me?

410
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,600
All you do every day

411
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,280
is pamper your granddaughter.

412
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,120
What about me?

413
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,360
Do you even see me?

414
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,159
I didn't get married

415
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,439
to put my mom into suffering.

416
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:22,719
You insulted her

417
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:23,959
and me.

418
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,000
You cast shame

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,080
on my whole family!

420
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Xin,

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Xin!

422
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,639
Why are you standing here?

423
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:02,879
Why did you leave

424
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,479
without telling us?

425
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,560
I'm worried about you.

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
Haowen abandoned me.

427
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:11,760
Don't be silly.

428
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
Haowen wouldn't do that.

429
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,199
He wants a divorce.

430
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,800
What should I do?

431
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,199
What can I do?

432
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,280
No, that won't happen.

433
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,879
That won't happen.

434
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,479
Don't worry.

435
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,959
He abandoned me, sis.

436
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,800
He abandoned me.

437
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:37,760
I won't.

438
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll never leave you.

439
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,360
Now that we've inspected the projects,

440
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,879
let's have a few words.

441
00:19:58,879 --> 00:19:59,360
Alright.

442
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:00,919
Welcome.

443
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
Are today's projects

444
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,360
worth investing in?

445
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,639
What do you think?

446
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,199
I'm the boss here.

447
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm asking for your opinion.

448
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,360
I just want to see

449
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,800
if my thoughts

450
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,840
align with yours.

451
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,560
I want to know it too.

452
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,879
Whether our thoughts

453
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:23,479
align.

454
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,080
I'm the boss.

455
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,919
I have this right, don't I?

456
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,199
Of course.

457
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,360
I just try to make a test

458
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,120
to see if we are on the same level.

459
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,040
If so,

460
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,840
then in the future,

461
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,120
I can make decisions on my own.

462
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,040
Want to be a big woman?

463
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,120
I've noticed that lately,

464
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,879
you've been very confident.

465
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,199
A bit too much, maybe?

466
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,399
Thanks to your influence.

467
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,959
No matter how plain you are,

468
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,560
you have to be very confident.

469
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,320
Am I plain?

470
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,760
Alright, alright.

471
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,120
I won't play the boss here.

472
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,719
To be fair,

473
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,239
let's write down our opinions separately,

474
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,560
and then exchange them.

475
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:02,120
Sounds good.

476
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,760
Write in detail, though.

477
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,239
Include the reasons

478
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,120
to convince me.

479
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,280
Actually, I already wrote something.

480
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:11,679
Let me adjust it.

481
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,040
Looks like our thoughts

482
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,120
are surprisingly aligned again.

483
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,959
Alright,

484
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,120
let's move forward

485
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,600
in this direction,

486
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,199
and refine the report.

487
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:34,959
OK.

488
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,600
By the way,

489
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,719
I have a meeting

490
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,399
with a startup boss.

491
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:43,520
Would you like to join us?

492
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,679
New agenda?

493
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,919
It was a last-minute arrangement.

494
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,080
Do you have plans?

495
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,040
I promised a video call with the kids.

496
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:54,760
It's alright.

497
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I'll reschedule it.

498
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,520
No, kids come first.

499
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,439
Work can wait.

500
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,840
Go ahead with your call.

501
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,360
Stop with that.

502
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,239
I'll go call the kids now,

503
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,000
and be right back.

504
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:14,919
Ms. Chen Wanzhen,

505
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,800
Hello.

506
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,719
Hello.

507
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:17,479
There are two guests,

508
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,639
claiming to be your best friends,

509
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:19,520
would like to see you.

510
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,080
My best friends?

511
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,879
I want to have a video call with

512
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:23,479
Wanwan and Zhenzhen.

513
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,919
why aren't you answering?

514
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,879
Tell me

515
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,040
who they're with right now.

516
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,600
I'll come...

517
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,120
Mom!

518
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,439
My babies.

519
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,120
Mom!

520
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,679
You...

521
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,360
Mom!

522
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,520
It's our birthday.

523
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
You've worked so hard for us.

524
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
Mom, we love you.

525
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,040
Dad told us that.

526
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,360
Don't think I'm cheesy.

527
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,760
Happy birthday, little beauties.

528
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,959
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

529
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,679
Surprised? Happy?

530
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:47,479
Thank you.

531
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,919
Happy birthday to you.

532
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,679
Happy birthday to you.

533
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:58,800
Happy birthday to you.

534
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,439
Happy birthday to you.

535
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,560
Mr. Zhou,

536
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,800
thank you.

537
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,120
If it weren't for your help,

538
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,320
I wouldn't have been able to fulfill my wish.

539
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,040
Don't mention it.

540
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,120
I did it

541
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,879
to cheer Wendy up.

542
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:03,879
So she can work

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,800
with more enthusiasm.

544
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:07,679
By the way, Mr. Yu,

545
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,760
I heard about the rectification of Xinmiao,

546
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,879
which makes Blue Ocean

547
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:12,679
the company

548
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:13,800
with most users, again.

549
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:14,800
Tell me,

550
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,399
what exactly did you do?

551
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Nothing.

552
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,520
Normal operation, that's all.

553
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:21,800
I never expected

554
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,280
that our competitor

555
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:24,080
would fall.

556
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,320
It's a windfall to us.

557
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,520
You really didn't do anything?

558
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:32,320
Xinmiao's current strategy

559
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,320
is nothing new

560
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,399
than the one

561
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,719
we used many years ago.

562
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,479
In the short term,

563
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,760
such data growth

564
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,879
might seem very impressive,

565
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,399
but as the regulations

566
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,800
become more and more stringent,

567
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,959
This is not a long-term solution.

568
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:46,879
And it has been 8 years,

569
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,040
since our company was established,

570
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,320
while they've only been around for five.

571
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:50,520
In this regard,

572
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,800
we are more experienced.

573
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:52,639
I'm just worried

574
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,439
that they might make

575
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,280
the same mistake

576
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,080
as we did.

577
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,080
Yaohui Co. was right

578
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,679
to invest in Blue Ocean.

579
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:03,840
Indeed, Mr. Zhou.

580
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,360
So I must congratulate you.

581
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,679
Our company

582
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,199
has always relied on

583
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,280
solid content

584
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,439
and strong operational capabilities

585
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,159
to survive.

586
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,840
Plus,

587
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,120
the investment environment

588
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,439
for the entire Internet industry

589
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,399
have already passed

590
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,919
unregulated growth phase.

591
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,120
Now, what's needed is

592
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,719
refined operation.

593
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,520
Mr. Zhou,

594
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,520
I think the Xinmiao incident

595
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:28,639
might be an opportunity.

596
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,199
I propose

597
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,080
a full acquisition.

598
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,120
So, what's your plan?

599
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,879
How could you be wrong

600
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:41,800
on such a simple test?

601
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,919
Can you just think a little more?

602
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,520
As if you would get it right.

603
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,360
Anyone can find faults.

604
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,679
Easy for you to say.

605
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,280
Now you are talking back?

606
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,439
Listen, Li Yunjie,

607
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,919
your good times are over.

608
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,679
My leave starts today.

609
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:57,679
From now on, you are

610
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,520
under my supervision.

611
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,600
You better behave!

612
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,000
You're on leave?

613
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,679
Yes, I am,

614
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,679
and I'll oversee

615
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:07,639
your homework.

616
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,639
I don't want you. I want Dad.

617
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,439
Dad!

618
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,360
You heard it.

619
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,879
Mom wants to oversee my homework.

620
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,040
She's haunting me,

621
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,239
on homework and everything!

622
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,959
Don't worry.

623
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,000
Here's the deal.

624
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,040
I'll help

625
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,280
with Yunjie's study,

626
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,040
you enjoy your vacation,

627
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:24,639
and take care of the fetus.

628
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:25,959
Don't get overstressed.

629
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:26,840
Yes,

630
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,280
take care of your fetus.

631
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,439
Look at you two.

632
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,360
How do you even help?

633
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,239
Her grades keep getting worse.

634
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,280
When was the last time

635
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,439
she scored 100?

636
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,399
A 100? Impossible!

637
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:41,560
She's in grade 9,

638
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,040
not grade 3.

639
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,800
A 100?

640
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,760
She's not a genius.

641
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,439
Well,

642
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,239
she shouldn't be failing either.

643
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,080
Failing? Not really.

644
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,639
We have our own

645
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:52,439
study plan,

646
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,239
right?

647
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,080
Yes.

648
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,959
So,

649
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,879
don't push too hard!

650
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,399
Fine,

651
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:02,040
I'll give you two

652
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,840
one more chance.

653
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:05,800
Make good use of it.

654
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,199
Think carefully about your future.

655
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,840
Li Yunjie,

656
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,360
think it over thoroughly.

657
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,800
What should we do, Dad?

658
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,639
What should we do?

659
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:23,520
Keep calm.

660
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,080
Everything will be fine

661
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,159
as long as you work hard.

662
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:32,120
There'll be good results.

663
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,159
But hard work doesn't always

664
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,159
pay off.

665
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,840
Still, you need to work hard first.

666
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,280
Swollen leg again?

667
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:56,800
Let me

668
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:58,439
give you a massage.

669
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,280
You mentioned a leave.

670
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,719
What do you mean by that?

671
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,239
It's just another

672
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,959
expression of

673
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,439
suspension.

674
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,000
But it's okay.

675
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,159
With my experience at Xinmiao,

676
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:25,280
I can secure

677
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,840
at least 80% of my salary.

678
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,199
It won't affect our family.

679
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,120
No,

680
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,199
I'm not asking about it.

681
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:31,560
Why?

682
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,239
Why did they suspend you?

683
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,679
The company was reported,

684
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,239
and

685
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,280
closed for rectification.

686
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,439
They framed me up,

687
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,040
claiming that I reported it.

688
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,120
I got suspended for investigation.

689
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:51,600
That's fine then.

690
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,080
"Fine"? What are you saying?

691
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,080
Didn't you just say

692
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,040
it was a false accusation?

693
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,439
Your contributions to Xinmiao

694
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:00,560
are self-evident

695
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,520
to everyone.

696
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:03,239
You have nothing to fear.

697
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,439
Let them investigate.

698
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:05,320
The truth will come out

699
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,919
eventually.

700
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,639
Right?

701
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,199
I think so too.

702
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,719
But it's still frustrating.

703
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,879
Actually,

704
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:15,760
when I saw my dad

705
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,520
dancing today,

706
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,000
I was really happy.

707
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,719
But before I could enjoy it,

708
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,919
something happened between

709
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,760
Xin and Haowen.

710
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What's the matter?

711
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:26,760
Haowen,

712
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,679
he wants to divorce Xin.

713
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,520
No way.

714
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
He does.

715
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,560
Impossible.

716
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,919
Anyone could get divorced,

717
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,840
but those two? Impossible.

718
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,159
What do you mean by "anyone"?

719
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,199
Are you trying to imply us?

720
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,879
Nonsense,

721
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm just joking.

722
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,479
How could they possibly get a divorce?

723
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,040
Haowen loves Xin

724
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,399
as much as

725
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,399
I love you.

726
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,520
Not to mention

727
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,639
they have kids now,

728
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,320
Little Watermelon, cute baby girl.

729
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,040
How could they get a divorce?

730
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:00,320
I know, right?

731
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:02,719
Why don't you call him

732
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:03,840
and ask?

733
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,360
Right now?

734
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
It's late at night.

735
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,760
Video call,

736
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,399
see what he's up to.

737
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,760
He might be busy.

738
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,919
He's calling back.

739
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:37,520
Brother-in-law,

740
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,239
no, ex-brother-in-law,

741
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,879
you are the younger one,

742
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,919
so I shall call you Li Lin.

743
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,879
Alright, I'm hanging up.

744
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,719
I'm at a dinner.

745
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,679
Mr. Jia,

746
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,959
come on in.

747
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,120
What a disappointment!

748
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,719
Mr. Jia,

749
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,159
he is a boss.

750
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,360
There's always some socializing.

751
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:07,959
It's normal.

752
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,360
Really?

753
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,560
Brother-in-law,

754
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,120
have some tea.

755
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,560
Haowen,

756
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:28,760
I didn't ask you out for the tea.

757
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,399
An honest word,

758
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,840
that's all I want from you.

759
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,560
What's going on between you two?

760
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,719
Why a divorce?

761
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,000
Brother-in-law,

762
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:39,719
there's something

763
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,479
that I can't tell you here.

764
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,479
It is between Xin and me.

765
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,560
You don't need to worry.

766
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,320
What is this thing

767
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,800
that you can't tell me?

768
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,520
We're family.

769
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,639
Family doesn't keep secrets.

770
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,719
That's what makes us

771
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,959
a family!

772
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,320
Look,

773
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,040
Haowen,

774
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,399
If you have anything

775
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,360
you can't say

776
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,239
to other people,

777
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,479
something unspeakable,

778
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,320
you can tell me.

779
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,520
I'm not just your brother-in-law,

780
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,719
but also your best friend.

781
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:06,919
I'll help you deal with it,

782
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,800
Okay?

783
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,320
Just tell me the truth.

784
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:10,879
Meng'an is worried sick.

785
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,919
Brother-in-law,

786
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,959
Xin felt it too.

787
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,840
Really, if two people

788
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:18,919
can't get along, they should separate.

789
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:20,000
Forcing things never works.

790
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,280
Even if we stay married,

791
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,719
this marriage won't be happy.

792
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,439
I don't believe it.

793
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,520
I don't believe Xin

794
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,199
brought this up.

795
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,800
If so, she would've said it first.

796
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,520
Even if she did,

797
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,560
You'd just accept it?

798
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,760
Things don't work like this.

799
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,120
She didn't mean it.

800
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,239
Isn't that what couples do

801
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,120
messing around, arguing?

802
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,320
Time heals everything,

803
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,919
isn't it?

804
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,879
Haowen,

805
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,239
you're much better a husband

806
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,360
than I am.

807
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
You're a role model

808
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,719
that I look up to.

809
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,159
Just tell me,

810
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,879
why?

811
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,840
What really happened?

812
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,320
Brother-in-law,

813
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:55,919
like I said

814
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:56,600
some truths

815
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,959
are better sealed.

816
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,520
Because, some things, if spoken,

817
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,360
would hurt people.

818
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:02,679
This really is a family matter.

819
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,800
Your family's matter, huh?

820
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,439
I'm not a part of it, right?

821
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,159
Alright, fine!

822
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,159
We are not in-laws,

823
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:09,719
no problem,

824
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,360
but we are still friends.

825
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
Meng'an always asks me,

826
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,840
how are you and Haowen

827
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,879
so close?

828
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,639
You're like brothers.

829
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:19,439
I told her it was because of his character.

830
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,560
Nothing matters more

831
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,639
than a person's

832
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:22,199
character.

833
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,360
You are a good person.

834
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,800
After all these years...

835
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,199
think about your two kids.

836
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,199
Xiongxiong,

837
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,159
and Little Watermelon,

838
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:30,840
who is

839
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
just a baby.

840
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,360
Are you going to abandon them?

841
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,840
What about their future?

842
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:35,800
No, brother-in-law,

843
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,159
We're just separating.

844
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:38,159
Getting divorced

845
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,239
doesn't mean

846
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,399
abandoning Xin and the kids.

847
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,159
Then what's the problem?

848
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:41,840
Why do you want a divorce?

849
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,399
Do you have someone else?

850
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,679
I don't believe so.

851
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,320
Why won't you tell me the truth?

852
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:55,239
Say it.

853
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:56,959
Speak up.

854
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:00,239
I can't, brother-in-law.

855
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:07,560
You won't say, huh?

856
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,879
Last chance,

857
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:11,959
speak up!

858
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,480
Truth hurts, brother-in-law.

859
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,880
Not telling it hurts even more!

860
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,520
Jia Haowen,

861
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,719
I won't ask again.

862
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,319
This is your family's business.

863
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,319
But I have to tell you,

864
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,520
I was wrong about you.

865
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,679
You disappointed me.

866
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,679
You treat marriage

867
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,880
and your kids like a joke.

868
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,679
He won't even tell me!

869
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,080
How did Jia Haowen

870
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,159
end up like this?

871
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:27,799
What exactly

872
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,440
did you tell him?

873
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,639
I just told him,

874
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:32,480
"You are a man.

875
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,000
You need to be responsible.

876
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,520
You can't just divorce on a whim."

877
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,960
And then I asked him,

878
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,719
"Do you have another woman outside?

879
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,960
Is that why you're in such a hurry

880
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,719
to get divorced?"

881
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,400
No wonder

882
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
he didn't want to tell you.

883
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,920
Then how should I ask?

884
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,120
He's already a jerk,

885
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,279
Why should I still be polite to him?

886
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
I thought you'd

887
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,560
get something out of him.

888
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,040
You should have played along with him.

889
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,199
You know,

890
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,319
comforting him, saying

891
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,080
"Marriage isn't easy.

892
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:06,440
Tolerance is a must."

893
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:07,400
Then he could've

894
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,880
been open up to you.

895
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,520
Open up?

896
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,560
You're the expert,

897
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,639
why didn't you go talk to him?

898
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,960
I'd love to, but

899
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,000
on what grounds?

900
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,920
Why don't we hire a "paparazzi"

901
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:21,920
to follow him?

902
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
Track him down?

903
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,679
Just like the one Xin had before.

904
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,520
Wait,

905
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,080
in hindsight,

906
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,719
Xin was right.

907
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,199
Maybe that paparazzi

908
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,239
was actually bought off by Haowen.

909
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,920
Let's find another one.

910
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:36,880
Really?

911
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Are you crazy?

912
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,359
If you do that,

913
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,759
you'll be just like Mengxin!

914
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,719
So what?

915
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,120
He's about to divorce my sister!

916
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,400
Why can't I have him followed?

917
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
He will be exposed!

918
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
I disagree.

919
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,560
Such tactic

920
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,040
won't hold up in the court.

921
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,440
Then what's your suggestion?

922
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:54,960
Just let me think.

923
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,239
I'll look into it.

924
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,239
See,

925
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:58,400
first,

926
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,080
take good care of your sister.

927
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,639
Smooth her

928
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,440
and comfort her.

929
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,279
Stall for time.

930
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Let them calm down.

931
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,600
Even if they

932
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,319
do decide to divorce,

933
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:06,440
at least we know

934
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,120
financially,

935
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,679
Haowen will support Mengxin.

936
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,679
Right?

937
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,560
Anyway,

938
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,159
we'll prepare for both results.

939
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,719
You're not saying anything useful.

940
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:18,040
You know what they say:

941
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,839
if you can't solve a problem,

942
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,199
leave it to time.

943
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,319
So we just let it drag on?

944
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,560
Yes.

945
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,199
Look how it eats!

946
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,159
it really loves the cucumber.

947
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,799
How about some garlic,

948
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,520
vinegar,

949
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,600
and maybe some sesame paste too.

950
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,440
How about that?

951
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:43,480
Isn't it cute?

952
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,080
It's so adorable.

953
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,440
Here,

954
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:48,480
try this.

955
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,319
Eat this.

956
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:50,520
Try this, try this.

957
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Try mine.

958
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,040
Let it try yours.

959
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,000
Are you full?

960
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,639
No work today?

961
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,040
It's just,

962
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,199
I'm,

963
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:07,759
on a vacation.

964
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:08,719
Plus it's the weekend.

965
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,839
I want to spend more time with the kids.

966
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,960
I'm not stressed

967
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,719
about the funding anymore,

968
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:13,639
so I want to help

969
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,400
you with the kids.

970
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,920
Raising kids isn't easy, right?

971
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,480
Yes, in the past,

972
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,639
I didn't spend much time with them.

973
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:19,319
But in these past few days,

974
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,359
I've been with them all the time,

975
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,839
and I'm exhausted.

976
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,080
I just realized how tired you were,

977
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,639
back then.

978
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,319
It's been tough for you all these years.

979
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:27,920
From now on, when you work,

980
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,120
I'll help take care of the kids.

981
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:30,839
Not easy to be a good father.

982
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,279
Then, I'll try to be a good husband.

983
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,679
Mr. Xu,

984
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:42,960
Mr. Xu,

985
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,520
Your older brother is calling again.

986
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,679
What should we do?

987
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,600
Tell him I'm not here.

988
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,679
Tell him I'm not here.

989
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,239
Are you sure?

990
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,920
I'll tell him this way.

991
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,799
Hello, big brother.

992
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,400
Why did you take so long to answer,

993
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,080
Sister-in-law?

994
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,520
I didn't hear it.

995
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,679
Household things, you know.

996
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,359
Not busier than me, I'm sure.

997
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,400
Well...

998
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,000
Where's my brother?

999
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,880
I want to speak to him.

1000
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,400
He's here.

1001
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,080
Give the phone to him.

1002
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,920
He's in the toilet.

1003
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,120
He's always in there!

1004
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,719
Every time I call,

1005
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,279
he's either without his phone

1006
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,359
or in the toilet.

1007
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:17,719
What's up with him?

1008
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,560
Hurry up, let him answer the phone.

1009
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,880
Slide the phone under the door

1010
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,400
to him.

1011
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,080
Just wait.

1012
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,120
Wait a moment, he...

1013
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,639
Hurry up.

1014
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,839
Who is it?

1015
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,000
Wait a sec.

1016
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,520
See, he's out.

1017
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Take a look.

1018
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,759
You see?

1019
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,080
Here he is.

1020
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:35,319
My goodness!

1021
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,719
You really...

1022
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:38,040
What's wrong with you?

1023
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,719
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

1024
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,040
No...

1025
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,239
No... no...

1026
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,440
No... no...

1027
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,120
What's wrong?

1028
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,679
Tell me what's wrong.

1029
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,239
I'm fine.

1030
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,199
Your mouth looks a bit crooked.

1031
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,120
Say something.

1032
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,239
Alright.

1033
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,440
Say something.

1034
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,560
Alright.

1035
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,400
Oh my goodness, you...

1036
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,159
Why didn't you tell me?

1037
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,480
I'll come over tomorrow.

1038
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,799
No.

1039
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:13,480
Wait for me.

1040
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,639
Is my mouth crooked?

1041
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,920
No.

1042
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:21,920
You were just...

1043
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
You were just nervous

1044
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,679
When you get nervous, maybe...

1045
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,359
He's been scared of him since I was a kid.

1046
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,080
Why is it?

1047
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:30,319
He's so far away.

1048
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,759
Why are you scared of him?

1049
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,159
What should we do?

1050
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,560
He's coming over tomorrow.

1051
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,839
Let him come.

1052
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,080
It's been so long since I last saw him.

1053
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,000
What time is it?

1054
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:42,600
Time?

1055
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,480
It's past 4 PM.

1056
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,040
Let's go,

1057
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,359
take me to the acupuncture.

1058
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:47,920
Where are we going?

1059
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,679
To the acupuncture.

1060
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,199
But,

1061
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,920
it's near their closing time.

1062
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,440
What?

1063
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,120
I scheduled it for 4 PM yesterday.

1064
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,120
Let's go.

1065
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,719
Did you have fun yesterday?

1066
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,159
Celebrating the kids' birthday,

1067
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,120
I was really happy.

1068
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,080
Was it Yu Hai's idea?

1069
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,560
No, it's me.

1070
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:12,080
First,

1071
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,199
I invited him to discuss

1072
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:14,480
the future of Blue Ocean.

1073
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,560
Second,

1074
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,159
you could celebrate the kids' birthday,

1075
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,359
giving you a surprise.

1076
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,319
So you won't be distracted

1077
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:20,319
while working.

1078
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,239
Am I a good boss to you now?

1079
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,239
I think I should

1080
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,080
change my name

1081
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,560
to Mr. Thoughtful.

1082
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,359
So thoughtful of you.

1083
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,319
Thank you, boss.

1084
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,080
You're welcome.

1085
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,600
But have you ever

1086
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,359
considered that Yu Hai

1087
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,239
might misunderstand?

1088
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:38,759
What misunderstanding?

1089
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,759
Ever since our divorce,

1090
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:43,679
he's been hoping for us back together.

1091
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,679
If we really got back together,

1092
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,000
do you think

1093
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,960
it would

1094
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,719
affect my work?

1095
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,440
I really hadn't thought about that.

1096
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,199
I just wanted to surprise you,

1097
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,080
so I did.

1098
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,080
But I'm not worried.

1099
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,839
You are not that foolish

1100
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,040
to consider a remarriage, aren't you?

1101
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,040
Wanzhen,

1102
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,600
I just want

1103
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:10,639
to be a little nicer to you.

1104
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,120
What do you mean?

1105
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,159
Sounds creepy.

1106
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:18,799
No,

1107
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,040
it's just a boss being nice

1108
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,480
to

1109
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,359
a competent employee

1110
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:23,880
who profits the company.

1111
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,199
Let's go out for a walk.

1112
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,000
We stay indoors long enough.

1113
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,040
It's stifling.

1114
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,880
Yes, it's stifling,

1115
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,560
Let's not stay indoors.

1116
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,719
We'll go out for a walk.

1117
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,600
Be careful on the way.

1118
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,799
Don't worry.

1119
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:44,679
We'll be back soon.

1120
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,839
Auntie's back!

1121
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,480
Going out?

1122
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,639
We're going out for a walk.

1123
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,359
Go finish your homework first,

1124
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:51,839
Xiongxiong.

1125
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,080
Xin,

1126
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,400
can you call Haowen?

1127
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:02,560
What for?

1128
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:03,960
Your uncle

1129
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,839
is coming over

1130
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,319
tomorrow.

1131
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,040
He needs Haowen's car

1132
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:09,960
to pick him up from the rail station.

1133
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,560
And maybe take him for a tour.

1134
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,080
Call him.

1135
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,359
Why don't you tell him directly?

1136
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,520
I want you to make the call.

1137
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,600
Let you two speak again.

1138
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,239
I don't know what happened.

1139
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:23,520
Haowen always soothed you well

1140
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,520
whenever there was a quarrel.

1141
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,759
What happened this time?

1142
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:28,480
What is this silent treatment for?

1143
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,440
This is between me and him.

1144
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:30,960
Just leave us alone.
