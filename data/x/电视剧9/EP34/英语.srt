3
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:58,559
Mom.

4
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,600
What have you been up to lately?

5
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,960
You should go home sometime.

6
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,600
Mom.

7
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,359
I'm on a business trip,

8
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,040
going to the airport.

9
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,520
Business trip?

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,079
No big deal, it's just that

11
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,999
your dad's older brother,

12
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:13,839
Xin's uncle,

13
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,320
is coming tomorrow.

14
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:16,680
Can you make it

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,319
back for dinner tomorrow?

16
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,920
Mom, I can't make it back.

17
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,200
When is my uncle arriving?

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,680
I'll have the driver pick him up

19
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,039
and follow him.

20
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,039
Okay.

21
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,559
Haowen,

22
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,319
When you're back from your trip,

23
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,480
check on Xin.

24
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,360
Got it, Mom.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
I'll hang up now.

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
Mr Jia, where are we going now?

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,960
Back to the office.

28
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,360
My mother-in-law has a visitor tomorrow.

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,240
Go pick him up

30
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,839
and follow him.

31
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:57,839
I won't go.

32
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,120
Tell them I'm on a business trip.

33
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,039
Okay.

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
Understood, Mr Jia.

35
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,719
Is this enough?

36
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,960
Two more.

37
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,319
No amount of this

38
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,200
will ease the anxiety inside.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
Anxiety?

40
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,400
Of course.

41
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,559
Why anxious?

42
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,080
Since Mom left,

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,159
he's been sitting here,

44
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,839
not moving.

45
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:33,159
Isn't it anxiety?

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,800
I get it.

47
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,520
It's that fear of

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
being controlled

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,800
by the elder, right?

50
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,159
It's okay, Dad.

51
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
We're the same.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,719
This time is different.

53
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,719
How is it different?

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
He lied.

55
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,960
It's worse.

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,879
Who knows how uncle

57
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,400
will react when he arrives.

58
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,279
What should we do?

59
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,319
Dad.

60
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,159
That's your fault.

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:08,839
He's here.

62
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:09,800
You should have at least

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,719
called me.

64
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:10,999
You...

65
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,240
- Guangrong.
- You should've told me.

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,200
You brought so much stuff.

67
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,640
Guanghua,

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,999
you...

69
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,559
you made me so worried.

70
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,399
I'm fine.

71
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,519
Really?

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,720
Well.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,639
What's Dad doing?

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,559
Showing off to uncle

75
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,639
that he's doing well.

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,600
Making moves.

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,959
Good, good.

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,319
Better than I expected.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,559
Sit.

80
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:05,920
Uncle.

81
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,399
Have a seat.

82
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,399
Sit down.

83
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,480
Sit down.

84
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,680
You sit.

85
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,959
They told me on the way that

86
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,160
you're recovering well.

87
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,280
I didn't believe it.

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,559
In yesterday's video call,

89
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,240
I saw your mouth was crooked.

90
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
I thought...

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,920
I was so worried.

92
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,439
I barely slept last night.

93
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
He's recovering well.

94
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,480
But no matter what,

95
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,840
you should have

96
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,240
told me about it.

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,160
He didn't want us to call you.

98
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,319
Yes.

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,680
Why didn't you

100
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
want them to call me?

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,559
He doesn't exercise.

102
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,360
Sometimes.

103
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,959
He doesn't eat properly.

104
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,480
Sometimes.

105
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,079
That's your fault.

106
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,639
Well,

107
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,959
he didn't want to tell me,

108
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,079
he didn't eat and exercise.

109
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,079
What about you?

110
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,600
No.

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,759
He didn't listen.

112
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,240
We've been waiting for you.

113
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,999
You should criticize him.

114
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:03,800
Guanghua,

115
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,319
you didn't want them to tell me.

116
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,120
Do you know

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,360
your recovery

118
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,240
and your body

119
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,959
concerns the whole family?

120
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,879
You can't just think about yourself.

121
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,240
You can't ignore me.

122
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,680
Well...

123
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,319
You go ahead.

124
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,800
What's wrong?

125
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:22,759
Nothing.

126
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,360
What were you going to say?

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
Anything else you're hiding from me?

128
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,519
Well...

129
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,639
I was afraid you'd

130
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,519
get upset.

131
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,639
That's all?

132
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,959
You shouldn't keep it from me

133
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,879
just because of that.

134
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,999
That's wrong.

135
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,160
Quite flexible.

136
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,519
Come on.

137
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,840
Try clapping again. Let me see.

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,399
Clap with both hands.

139
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,680
Clap harder.

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,519
Come on, let me see.

141
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:53,840
Clap, clap.

142
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,600
Let me check.

143
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,319
Come on.

144
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Keep going.

145
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,280
Both hands.

146
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,360
Both hands.

147
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,360
You even have rhythm.

148
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,999
Okay.

149
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,999
Now I feel relieved.

150
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,240
I've been worried.

151
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,720
You know?

152
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,680
Have some water.

153
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
Now I'm relieved.

154
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,480
It's okay.

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,840
He can do it.

156
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,840
He's recovering well.

157
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,800
You're right.

158
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,680
It's really impressive.

159
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,519
He's had a good foundation

160
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,439
since he was young.

161
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,519
He's even serving me water.

162
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,639
Come on, hand it over.

163
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,280
Hand it over.

164
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:35,920
Hand it over.

165
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,160
Drink.

166
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:39,759
Good.

167
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,920
Isn't it great?

168
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,480
He practiced all morning.

169
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,360
Practicing serving water?

170
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,280
Fine,

171
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
serve me another one.

172
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:52,759
Come on.

173
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,759
Another one.

174
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,399
Do it.

175
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:54,999
Another one.

176
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:55,360
Another one.

177
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,040
Do it well.

178
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,360
Do it again, Dad.

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,280
He's even teasing me.

180
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,439
Alright, alright.

181
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,879
Look at them.

182
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,160
Guanghua,

183
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,199
I brought

184
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,199
your favorite pickles.

185
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,600
Wait and see,

186
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,319
I'll make you pickled fish.

187
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,600
Not today.

188
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,160
Let's go out to eat.

189
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,680
Go out.

190
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:25,639
Why go out?

191
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,439
I've booked the place.

192
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,360
I've had it arranged.

193
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,439
Really?

194
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
Do as she says.

195
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,040
Okay.

196
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,559
Distinguished guests,

197
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,199
today we're having

198
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,720
a "Double 16 Feast."

199
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Before we start, we have

200
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,200
four nuts, four fruits,

201
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,080
four pastries, and four cold dishes.

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
After serving the dishes, we'll have

203
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,039
four main courses, four mixed dishes,

204
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,080
four vegetables, and four desserts.

205
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,799
That's a total of 32 dishes.

206
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,480
32 dishes?

207
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,360
We won't finish that.

208
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,560
Isn't that a bit of a waste?

209
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,799
The plates are small.

210
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Uncle, let me tell you,

211
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
this "Double 16 Feast"

212
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,399
is an

213
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,679
intangible cultural heritage.

214
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,919
What we're experiencing today

215
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,679
isn't just food,

216
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,279
it's cultural

217
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,480
heritage, right?

218
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,200
They say

219
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,679
it's the highest standard feast

220
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,639
for hosting family

221
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,639
and friends.

222
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,240
Actually, we've never had it before.

223
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,519
Since you're here,

224
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,279
we're honored to try it

225
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,639
and experience it.

226
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,960
Am I...

227
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,840
Am I that important?

228
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,639
Absolutely.

229
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,399
Definitely.

230
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,919
But you know what I love to eat.

231
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,440
I can't live without pickles.

232
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,200
This...

233
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,919
No, no, I'm fine.

234
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,679
I'm fine.

235
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,639
I can eat anything.

236
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,519
I've tasted all kinds of

237
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,720
hardships over the years.

238
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,399
No need to say.

239
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,519
This is definitely a treat.

240
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,120
Definitely.

241
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,120
Yes.

242
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,039
At this age,

243
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,840
you should enjoy.

244
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,080
Yes.

245
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,320
It's my first time.

246
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,720
I noticed I didn't recognize

247
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,999
many of the dishes on the table.

248
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,919
There are fruits and pastries.

249
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,360
But I don't recognize the rest.

250
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I'll show you.

251
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
Go.

252
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,279
This place is great.

253
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,320
So many dishes. Is it too much?

254
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,120
No.

255
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,399
It's rare for uncle to come.

256
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,799
We have to treat him well

257
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,120
and show my dad's generosity.

258
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,600
How much will this cost?

259
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,960
Alright, I'll pick some.

260
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,279
You go up and chat with them.

261
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,679
Okay?

262
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,519
Haowen used to

263
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,440
handle these things.

264
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,519
Can you manage?

265
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,960
Of course I can.

266
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,279
Don't look down on me.

267
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,679
He only managed

268
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,320
because I asked him to.

269
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,159
I can handle this.

270
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,840
You're so capable.

271
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,279
Is he coming or not?

272
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,240
I don't know.

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,759
He's probably busy.

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,480
Give him a call.

275
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,759
You call him.

276
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,720
You should call.

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,639
You let him arrange the car.

278
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,440
Call him.

279
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,360
I'll check this.

280
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,679
Hurry.

281
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,840
Okay, I'll call.

282
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,360
What did he say? Is he coming?

283
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,999
No one answers.

284
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,919
He's probably in a meeting.

285
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,560
Try again later.

286
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,320
How about adding some abalone?

287
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Up to you.

288
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,799
Why is no one answering?

289
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,840
Try again later. He's in a meeting.

290
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,279
If you

291
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,159
call too often,

292
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,919
he won't be able to answer.

293
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,399
Later.

294
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,440
Call again later.

295
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,840
Okay.

296
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Do you want to add anything else?

297
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,360
That's enough.

298
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,320
Goodness.

299
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,200
You've set a whole table of food.

300
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
In the past,

301
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
this is something

302
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,279
only a big family can afford.

303
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
Guangrong,

304
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,480
we're a big family too.

305
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,600
We have three generations.

306
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,720
Isn't that a big family?

307
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,639
Yes.

308
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,639
Let me tell you,

309
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,720
these are local

310
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
specialties.

311
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,720
After eating this,

312
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,440
you won't need to try anywhere else.

313
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,440
So, are you saying

314
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,159
I can only eat this one meal?

315
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,919
No,

316
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,720
I understand what you mean.

317
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,240
Guanghua,

318
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
you're really blessed.

319
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,840
This family is so

320
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,759
harmonious.

321
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,679
And I've found that

322
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,560
Chunjiang is really

323
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,960
a great place.

324
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,799
It's nurturing.

325
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,399
Right?

326
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,360
See?

327
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,399
Remember when you

328
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,519
sent us off?

329
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,039
You were reluctant.

330
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,360
You still remember that.

331
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,560
Really petty of you.

332
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,799
Indeed!

333
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
We're brothers,

334
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,039
when one left,

335
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,840
wouldn't the other feel lonely?

336
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,240
Now it's good.

337
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,120
Both of your daughters

338
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,560
are having

339
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,759
their second child.

340
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,799
Isn't it?

341
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Look.

342
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,999
Kid,

343
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,080
what should you call me?

344
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Grandpa.

345
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
See, she knows.

346
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Now, with just

347
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,679
one child per family,

348
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,999
the child has no aunts,

349
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,399
uncles, or cousins,

350
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,999
won't it be lonely in the future?

351
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,039
Yes.

352
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,080
Uncle,

353
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,600
if you like it here,

354
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,560
you can stay and

355
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,200
keep my dad company.

356
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,519
Stay as long as you want.

357
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,840
That's right.

358
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
Grandpas and grandma,

359
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,639
you all live well.

360
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,320
I'll work hard to

361
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,399
achieve four generations.

362
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,279
See?

363
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,919
I like children

364
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,200
with such ambition.

365
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:23,679
Kid,

366
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
tell me how many

367
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,720
children you're having in the future.

368
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,999
Well...

369
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,879
Yunjie is only 15 and hasn't

370
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,999
even finished middle school.

371
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:35,879
Yeah, you...

372
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,360
I asked too early.

373
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,999
Just kidding.

374
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,360
Grandpa will take it seriously.

375
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,999
Yes.

376
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,840
Just joking.

377
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
Nonsense.

378
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,999
Come on, let's start eating.

379
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,999
Wait.

380
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:47,639
Where is

381
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,360
the second son-in-law?

382
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,320
Where is he?

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,159
He's busy with work.

384
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,240
No need to wait for him.

385
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,480
Dad,

386
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,080
propose a toast.

387
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
Let's start.

388
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,960
Let's start first.

389
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,720
Alright.

390
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,480
Wait.

391
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,399
Guanghua,

392
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,480
this is no rush.

393
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,039
Our family shouldn't

394
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,120
be missing anyone.

395
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,759
We'll wait.

396
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,159
Wait.

397
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,919
Okay.

398
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,720
Let's wait.

399
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,159
Wait.

400
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
Coming.

401
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm here.

402
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,639
Uncle.

403
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,879
Uncle,

404
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm so sorry, really sorry.

405
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,879
The whole family is here,

406
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,600
yet I'm late.

407
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,639
I'm really sorry.

408
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,360
Dad, Mom,

409
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,639
I got caught up with something.

410
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,560
How about this?

411
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,879
I'll have three shots first.

412
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,600
Here.

413
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,440
I'll take the liquor.

414
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,159
I'll drink a whole pot.

415
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,240
Uncle,

416
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,039
this is the good wine my dad saved.

417
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,240
Isn't it enough?

418
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,039
We haven't started eating yet.

419
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,999
Come on.

420
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,639
Everyone, raise your glasses.

421
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,320
Raise your glasses.

422
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,039
Come on.

423
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,919
Welcome my brother,

424
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,440
your uncle, to Chunjiang.

425
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,960
Cheers.

426
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,519
Cheers.

427
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,080
Cheers.

428
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,480
Welcome, uncle.

429
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,039
Thanks.

430
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,720
How's it?

431
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Do you like it?

432
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,759
I'm okay.

433
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,600
This is

434
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,039
green tea, right?

435
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,799
Yes.

436
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,840
We used to drink floral tea.

437
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,399
You know, right?

438
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,600
But now,

439
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,240
many people drink green tea.

440
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
But I won't drink it.

441
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,679
Time

442
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,759
really flies.

443
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,159
Tomorrow,

444
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,840
I'll be

445
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,919
going back.

446
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,120
Strange, isn't it?

447
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,360
When you two left back then,

448
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,080
I felt bad too,

449
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,120
but it's a

450
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
different feeling

451
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,120
than I having to leave

452
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,639
tomorrow.

453
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,120
Guangrong.

454
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,639
Maybe it's because I'm older

455
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,519
and more sentimental.

456
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,600
Guanghua.

457
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,600
Guangrong.

458
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,600
I need to go back.

459
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,760
They need me.

460
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,040
I can't be away.

461
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,159
My grandson

462
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,600
has been acting up.

463
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,360
My son keeps

464
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,280
sending me voice messages,

465
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,000
not directly urging me to go back,

466
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,239
but saying, "Dad,

467
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,159
spend more time with my uncle."

468
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,280
But he actually

469
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,479
wants me to come back sooner.

470
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,479
I know.

471
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,479
I didn't sleep well last night,

472
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,439
thinking a lot.

473
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,719
But today,

474
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,199
I don't know what to say.

475
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,719
I just

476
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,439
want to remind you two

477
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,879
that even though we're

478
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,080
at the age to enjoy life,

479
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,800
Guanghua,

480
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:16,840
you need to know

481
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,080
how to protect yourself.

482
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:23,719
Look at

483
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,439
all kinds of

484
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,120
chaos in society.

485
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,040
So

486
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,760
don't answer

487
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,639
unknown calls.

488
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,919
Everything is under

489
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,080
real-name registration now.

490
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,800
We're in the open,

491
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,760
but scammers are in the dark.

492
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,639
It's easy to get tricked.

493
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,639
I'm speaking the truth.

494
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:43,199
Yes.

495
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,239
So,

496
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:44,800
if you're sick,

497
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,239
trust doctors and science.

498
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,239
All in all,

499
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,360
self-care

500
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,719
is necessary.

501
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,439
Exercise regularly.

502
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,399
You must exercise.

503
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,840
I see you have an

504
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,879
appliance

505
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,959
for pedaling.

506
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,520
Don't just use that thing at home.

507
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,919
Listen,

508
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:03,800
walking is

509
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,679
the way better than that.

510
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:06,520
Just walk.

511
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,560
Walk everyday.

512
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,159
Listen,

513
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:10,800
8,000 to 10,000 steps are best.

514
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,800
I suggest you walk

515
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,879
and explore the city.

516
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,719
Even if you've lived here

517
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,080
for decades,

518
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
there are streets and alleys

519
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,399
you haven't explored.

520
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,239
Right?

521
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,840
Yes.

522
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,600
Look,

523
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,479
if you pay attention,

524
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,679
you'll notice

525
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,800
subtle changes

526
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,520
in the city

527
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
every day.

528
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,959
You'll end up

529
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,439
walking 10,000 steps

530
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,199
without feeling tired.

531
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,280
Come back, wash up,

532
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:39,479
eat if you're hungry,

533
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,159
and take a nap.

534
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,080
Isn't that

535
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,479
nice?

536
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,280
Yeah.

537
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,679
But

538
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,040
be careful

539
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,159
not to get lost.

540
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Have your kids

541
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:56,040
buy a GPS watch for you.

542
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,080
That way,

543
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,639
you can walk freely,

544
00:19:58,639 --> 00:19:59,800
and they won't worry.

545
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,760
Am I being a bit wordy?

546
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,679
No.

547
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,399
Not at all.

548
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:03,879
I...

549
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,159
But let me tell you,

550
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:06,520
this is just a suggestion.

551
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Well, Ningli,

552
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,280
as long as

553
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,879
it doesn't

554
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,120
disrupt your life,

555
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,919
you can consider it.

556
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,080
Sure.

557
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,439
Yeah.

558
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,040
I don't know

559
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,840
what else to say.

560
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,600
Guangrong,

561
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,239
I remember it all.

562
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,639
Guanghua,

563
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,399
how many more times

564
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,679
will we see each other?

565
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,159
Guangrong.

566
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:35,439
Guangrong,

567
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,320
we'll come back to visit you.

568
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,360
I suggest

569
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,320
you go back when you

570
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
have time.

571
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,000
We

572
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,679
will.

573
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,719
Definitely.

574
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:47,800
Guangrong,

575
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,399
I've got a gift for you.

576
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Let me show you.

577
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,199
No, I won't take it.

578
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,080
Let's go.

579
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,840
No,

580
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,040
I don't need anything.

581
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,280
- I don't need.
- Come have a look.

582
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,080
Let's go.

583
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,600
No.

584
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,360
Have a look.

585
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,280
I don't need it.

586
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
Come.

587
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,439
Mr Zhou,

588
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,639
here's last week's industry report

589
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:27,239
from the business trip.

590
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,159
Take a look.

591
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,360
Thank you.

592
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:30,760
It's my job.

593
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,040
How about checking out

594
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,719
a high-end guesthouse

595
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:37,679
in the mountains?

596
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,840
Consider it a hotel industry review

597
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,879
and a break for yourself.

598
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:42,280
That sounds good,

599
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:43,639
but...

600
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,600
Let Mr Yu take care of the child.

601
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,199
Hasn't he been active lately?

602
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,320
Offer him a chance.

603
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,120
Let's go for a walk in the mountains.

604
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:51,560
I'd rather not.

605
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,239
I just got back from a trip.

606
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,560
Besides,

607
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:56,719
I don't want to give him false hope.

608
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,959
It's fine.

609
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,399
Mr Yu's in a good mood lately.

610
00:22:59,399 --> 00:22:59,879
Look,

611
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,959
he sent me the report.

612
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,399
Xinmiao's under scrutiny.

613
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,120
Blue Ocean is set to win.

614
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:04,840
What does that mean?

615
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,639
Look,

616
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,479
Xinmiao was penalized for

617
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,239
algorithm violations.

618
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:09,879
The editor-in-chief was suspended.

619
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:10,760
Blue Ocean is back

620
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,600
in the top spot.

621
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,719
Yu Hai called me

622
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,600
to have a meeting to discuss

623
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,679
next steps.

624
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,879
He wants to take down Xinmiao completely.

625
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,479
Editor-in-chief suspended indefinitely?

626
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,360
Mr Zhou, I'm sorry.

627
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,120
Then give me these two tickets.

628
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,800
I'll check it out for you.

629
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:28,479
No, you...

630
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,360
Who are you going with?

631
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,320
Xinmiao's editor-in-chief,

632
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,320
Xu Meng'an.

633
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,399
Why are you

634
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,639
taking me out?

635
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:48,040
Are you two so free?

636
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,919
Don't you need to work?

637
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,280
I am working.

638
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,479
The resort we're visiting today

639
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,399
is a project our company

640
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,760
is evaluating.

641
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,479
Fine,

642
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:57,919
what you're doing is jobbery.

643
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,120
What about you?

644
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,919
I wasn't feeling well yesterday,

645
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,520
so I asked for a leave.

646
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,280
I'll rest for two days.

647
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,520
What's wrong?

648
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,280
Nothing, just a normal reaction.

649
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,000
You should rest

650
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,719
at home then.

651
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,320
Have your husband stay with you.

652
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,840
He can't.

653
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,719
He said he's busy today.

654
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,080
Busy with what?

655
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I won't divorce.

656
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
What if he cheats?

657
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,120
I won't divorce.

658
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,439
What about a serious illness?

659
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:39,879
I won't divorce.

660
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
That's good.

661
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,600
But also quite annoying.

662
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,560
Who brought up

663
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,280
divorce first?

664
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,879
This time it was Haowen.

665
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,000
This time?

666
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,520
Any other times?

667
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,199
Previously,

668
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,959
when Dad was ill,

669
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,360
but that was

670
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,399
just mentioning,

671
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,639
I didn't mean it.

672
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,879
Haowen is serious this time.

673
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,360
To be honest,

674
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,959
up to now,

675
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,639
I don't think Haowen

676
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:17,600
wants to divorce you.

677
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,360
Yeah,

678
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,679
I don't think he's the type

679
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:21,840
to abandon his family.

680
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,679
I don't know Haowen well,

681
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,600
but if he brought up divorce,

682
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,320
there must be a reason.

683
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,399
Maybe I'm just too act up.

684
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,159
But since I got pregnant,

685
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,600
I've been sick.

686
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm already seeing a doctor.

687
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:42,800
So, you see,

688
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm not having any extreme thoughts

689
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,600
anymore,

690
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,199
right?

691
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,000
No.

692
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,679
That's what the doctor said.

693
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,639
Pregnant women will be more or less

694
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,000
depressed before and after birth,

695
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,479
varying in severity.

696
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:54,120
So

697
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,360
don't just equate

698
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,159
yourself with a patient.

699
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,080
Okay?

700
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,320
Mengxin,

701
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,879
have you made up your mind?

702
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,199
That no matter what he does,

703
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,320
you won't divorce?

704
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,479
Yes, I won't divorce.

705
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:06,000
Haowen treats me very well.

706
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,199
I know it.

707
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,360
Then just hang on.

708
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:11,879
Yes, hang on.

709
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:12,679
This isn't the time

710
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:13,840
to make decisions.

711
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,520
Maybe over time,

712
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,879
you'll understand why.

713
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,679
Is that what you do?

714
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,919
How long did it take?

715
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,320
Yu Hai,

716
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,159
you need to handle this.

717
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,879
Right now,

718
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:38,800
call immediately

719
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:40,040
and get Huang Sisi

720
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:41,679
removed from Xinmiao.

721
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:43,239
I mean, senior,

722
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
you never

723
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,320
contacted me before.

724
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,239
Now you need me

725
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,479
to handle this?

726
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:49,800
Listen,

727
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,239
Huang Sisi

728
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,760
used to be at Blue Ocean,

729
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,320
but now she's at Xinmiao.

730
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,159
Can I manage that?

731
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,840
What's her relationship with you?

732
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,639
You don't know?

733
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,840
No, what relationship?

734
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,760
We're just

735
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,800
superior and subordinate.

736
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,959
We have

737
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,959
nothing else.

738
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:04,719
I've

739
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,120
made it clear

740
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,320
to Meng'an

741
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,600
and Wanzhen.

742
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,719
I'll say it again,

743
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
we have no relationship.

744
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,719
You should know

745
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,639
what kind of person

746
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:14,719
Huang Sisi is.

747
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,879
Her tactics

748
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:16,919
and tricks,

749
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
didn't she learn from you?

750
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,600
Well,

751
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:20,159
honestly,

752
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,639
I suspect

753
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,439
you're behind this.

754
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,959
Where does that come from?

755
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:27,840
What do you mean?

756
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,719
Am I wrong?

757
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,280
Where are you going?

758
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,080
I'm talking to you.

759
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,959
I'm going to pee.

760
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,239
Go ahead.

761
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,080
Why close the door?

762
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,760
I need to pee.

763
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,840
Is there a problem?

764
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,320
Why are you afraid?

765
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,679
Just pee. I'll talk.

766
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,800
You stand there watching.

767
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,439
I can't pee.

768
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,879
Just pee. I'll talk.

769
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,959
I don't care

770
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:44,879
about your relationship

771
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:45,719
with Huang Sisi.

772
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:47,120
What relationship?

773
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,719
Shout if you want. I don't care.

774
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,520
Anyway,

775
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,639
if you're going to

776
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,479
cause trouble,

777
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,360
do it elsewhere.

778
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,159
Your actions are making Meng'an

779
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,120
suffer.

780
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,280
Meng'an is feeling

781
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,239
wronged.

782
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,479
Are you going to pee or not?

783
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,520
I can't pee, senior.

784
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
I really can't.

785
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,199
I quit.

786
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,879
Senior, senior.

787
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,239
You still remember

788
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm your senior?

789
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:07,600
"Great virtue promotes growth."

790
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,879
"Knowledge and action are one."

791
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:09,600
You've betrayed

792
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,760
our school motto.

793
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:11,959
What's this about?

794
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,000
What are you doing?

795
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,879
You've ruined Xinmiao.

796
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,280
Is this what you wanted?

797
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,879
You're not just

798
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:17,919
ruining a company.

799
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,919
You're destroying a family.

800
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,439
How am I destroying

801
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,879
your family?

802
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,760
Talking that to someone

803
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,479
who has a broken family?

804
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,760
What do you mean?

805
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,840
Always talking about Meng'an,

806
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,879
Meng'an.

807
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,399
Showing off in front of me,

808
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,600
a single man.

809
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,280
Are you?

810
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,520
Let me tell you,

811
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,639
my old fellow.

812
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,320
Meng'an

813
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:41,959
is not someone

814
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,919
easy to mess with.

815
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,520
If she fights with

816
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,360
Huang Sisi,

817
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
who knows who will win?

818
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:47,679
Right?

819
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:47,919
You...

820
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:48,719
And

821
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,199
if it really gets bad,

822
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:50,959
I'll cover for her,

823
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,439
okay?

824
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,800
She can come to Blue Ocean

825
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,560
and be a director.

826
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,719
How about that?

827
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,679
You cover for her?

828
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,040
She's pregnant now.

829
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,879
Can you handle it

830
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,840
if something happens?

831
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,399
Well,

832
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,479
so what should I do?

833
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:03,840
I don't care.

834
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Meng'an has suffered

835
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,719
anyway.

836
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,439
You need to find

837
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,320
a solution.

838
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,280
I don't have any.

839
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,919
You...

840
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,639
I have a solution for you.

841
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,159
Call Huang Sisi now,

842
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,360
tell her

843
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,879
to apologize in front of the whole

844
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:19,479
company

845
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,520
and take full

846
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,199
responsibility for this.

847
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,600
Make the call. That's it.

848
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,639
You're killing me.

849
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:29,360
What are you doing?

850
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,040
What are you doing?

851
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,800
Don't be impulsive.

852
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,760
I...

853
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,159
I need to breathe.

854
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:34,560
I...

855
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,280
I can't get out.

856
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,879
Yu Hai,

857
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,479
think about it,

858
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,360
Meng'an is pregnant.

859
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,600
It's not mine.

860
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,080
Hey.

861
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Look up.

862
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:53,520
God is watching

863
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,399
your every move.

864
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,239
Goodness.

865
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,280
God is fair.

866
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,439
So don't worry about

867
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,919
momentary gains and losses.

868
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,360
Even if I failed in marriage,

869
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,600
my career is

870
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,199
successful now.

871
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,280
I feel like I've lived up

872
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
to my worth.

873
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,239
Are you

874
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,679
really

875
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,560
okay with his cheating?

876
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:20,800
Of course,

877
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm not okay with it.

878
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,120
Lin,

879
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,280
why are you here?

880
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,879
I'm looking for Mr Zhang.

881
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,520
Is he here?

882
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,159
He is.

883
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:36,760
You're here

884
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,719
for that thing, right?

885
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,840
Follow me.

886
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,760
Thanks.

887
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,000
Lin,

888
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,320
Listen,

889
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,199
you need to have a serious

890
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,280
talk with Mr Zhang.

891
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:47,120
Meng'an has been wronged.

892
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,840
Mr Zhang,

893
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,159
Meng'an's husband,

894
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,479
Li Lin, is here to see you.

895
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,280
Li Lin,

896
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
it's been years.

897
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,280
I hardly recognize you.

898
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,719
Mr Zhang.

899
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,040
Where's Meng'an?

900
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
She's not well and resting at home.

901
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:07,639
Well,

902
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,199
look,

903
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,959
I was planning to visit her today.

904
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,840
What a coincidence.

905
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:14,040
Please have a seat.

906
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,439
No.

907
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
I'll be brief.

908
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,560
Go ahead.

909
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:18,439
Mr Zhang,

910
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,399
Meng'an has been

911
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,320
with you

912
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,760
from the magazine to Xinmiao,

913
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:24,840
going through

914
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,080
all the ups and downs,

915
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,239
working hard

916
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,360
with no complains, right?

917
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Yes.

918
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,560
She's taken on more than others

919
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:31,879
while getting less.

920
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:32,479
Less?

921
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
Not really.

922
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,199
She's had

923
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,280
plenty of empty promises.

924
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:40,120
No,

925
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,280
the company's in a tough spot now,

926
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,479
but when things improve,

927
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,719
I'll make it up to her.

928
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,000
No, don't bother.

929
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,840
No more promises.

930
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,879
We don't care about money.

931
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,879
As long as Meng'an

932
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:51,879
feels she's with

933
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:52,600
the right boss,

934
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,959
we can accept that.

935
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,520
But you can't make her

936
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:55,879
feel

937
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,679
wronged

938
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:57,919
in this company.

939
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,879
Yes, yes, I understand.

940
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:00,959
I wanted

941
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,000
to find someone

942
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,800
to help

943
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,959
since she's pregnant,

944
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:04,639
but I didn't expect

945
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,120
things have gotten this bad.

946
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,639
You need to find the right person.

947
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:09,000
Don't you know

948
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,719
what kind of person

949
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,439
Huang Sisi is?

950
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,760
You put her in the company

951
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,040
to sabotage Meng'an

952
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,840
and then make her

953
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,760
take the blame.

954
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,360
She's one of your veterans.

955
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,399
Think about it.

956
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,439
You treat her like that.

957
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,879
She'll be disheartened.

958
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:20,919
In that case,

959
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,719
what's the point of

960
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,239
her staying here?

961
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:24,760
Is it?

962
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,439
Li Lin, calm down.

963
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,479
It's just a fight.

964
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,479
It's fine.

965
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,159
I want to fire her anyway.

966
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,360
What do you mean?

967
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,080
You're going to fight

968
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,840
with Meng'an?

969
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,040
You wanna fire her?

970
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:39,000
What's going on? This company

971
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,879
allows violence now?

972
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:41,360
Who?

973
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,479
No, no, no.

974
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,639
It's not about violence.

975
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:44,159
Well,

976
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,399
your wife grabbed her by the hair

977
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,719
and beat her up.

978
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,159
You see, she's pregnant.

979
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,239
She must be really fierce.

980
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:51,840
Look, she hit someone

981
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,760
and I have to go

982
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,520
visit her.

983
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,000
What?

984
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,120
Rachel.

985
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,639
Get out.

986
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,639
Is Meng'an really okay?

987
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:11,719
She's fine.

988
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,800
Your sister

989
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,719
at least got some revenge for me.

990
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:15,919
She beat her up.

991
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,439
When did this happen?

992
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,560
It's over now.

993
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:24,199
Why didn't you let me help you?

994
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,080
You're pregnant,

995
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,399
what if something went wrong?

996
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:27,879
It...

997
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
happened suddenly.

998
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,320
What's so sudden?

999
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,800
You

1000
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,719
could still tell me.

1001
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,840
There's always a process.

1002
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,439
If something happens,

1003
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,199
just call me,

1004
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,520
and I'll be there right away.

1005
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,040
Who's bullying you?

1006
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,280
I can help you.

1007
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,320
I have nothing to do at home.

1008
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,080
Why didn't you call me

1009
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,719
when you needed help?

1010
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,959
You're making me anxious.

1011
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,919
I couldn't

1012
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,520
ask you to handle this.

1013
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,320
Since you're at home doing nothing,

1014
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,120
maybe you should find a job.

1015
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,120
It could

1016
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,040
help distract

1017
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,080
your attention.

1018
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:56,679
When I was at home,

1019
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:57,959
I used to overthink.

1020
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
After I started working,

1021
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,639
I felt more fulfilled.

1022
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,479
I think Wanzhen

1023
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,760
has a point.

1024
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,879
Maybe you can

1025
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,040
give it a try.

1026
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:29,319
Hi.

1027
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,759
Where are the kids?

1028
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,639
Well,

1029
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
come in first.

1030
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,040
I'm here to pick up the kids.

1031
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:37,880
They're

1032
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,719
with their Grandpa.

1033
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,359
I'll go get them.

1034
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:41,799
Wait.

1035
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,839
They haven't seen Grandpa

1036
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:43,920
for a while.

1037
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,440
Let them

1038
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,920
spend more time with him.

1039
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,759
Look, I...

1040
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,120
I found a video online

1041
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,920
and made two dishes

1042
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,639
specifically for you.

1043
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,159
How about

1044
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,719
we sit down,

1045
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,719
eat

1046
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,839
and chat?

1047
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,679
It's fine.

1048
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,040
It's

1049
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,600
not dark cuisine.

1050
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,359
It's edible.

1051
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:03,199
I made them with my heart.

1052
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:03,759
Fine.

1053
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,799
Really?

1054
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:07,679
Mr Zhou said

1055
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,279
you have

1056
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,920
a new acquisition plan.

1057
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,359
Why didn't you tell me?

1058
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,560
No.

1059
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,480
That day,

1060
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,639
with the kid's birthday

1061
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:17,120
and

1062
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,639
the Xinmiao issue,

1063
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,679
I suddenly

1064
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,520
had this idea.

1065
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,719
I told Mr Zhou

1066
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,120
to ask his opinion

1067
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,719
and whether he supports it.

1068
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,719
I didn't expect

1069
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,679
he'd be so supportive.

1070
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,600
So, you think I'm insignificant

1071
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,159
as the project lead?

1072
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:30,960
No.

1073
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,480
No,

1074
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
not at all.

1075
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,199
I just feel

1076
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,159
the plan isn't fully developed yet.

1077
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,040
I'll present it to you

1078
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,159
once it's complete.

1079
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:38,639
Alright.

1080
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,719
Let's clear this up

1081
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,319
today.

1082
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,159
Talk it through.

1083
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,839
Today's atmosphere...

1084
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:58,960
Good-looking.

1085
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,120
Try it.

1086
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:13,159
Maybe it needs

1087
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,120
a bit more

1088
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:14,920
vinegar?

1089
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,159
Mr Yu,

1090
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:24,839
now you have time to learn to cook?

1091
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,960
Yes, I've realized how hard

1092
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,759
it's been for you all these years.

1093
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,719
I even cut my finger earlier.

1094
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,639
I can't imagine how many times

1095
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
you've cut yourself.

1096
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,560
Is it good?

1097
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,199
No.

1098
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,000
It's okay. It's just an appetizer.

1099
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:49,359
Finally, you're here.

1100
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,120
Cheers.

1101
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,560
Go ahead.

1102
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,040
What a lovely day it is.

1103
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,359
Our home feels so cozy.

1104
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,159
Talk about the plan.

1105
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:22,000
Well, Wanzhen,

1106
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,799
we've been

1107
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,920
together again recently,

1108
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,400
for working,

1109
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,679
working,

1110
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:32,440
and it reminds me

1111
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,960
of the old days.

1112
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,799
It reminds me of

1113
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:38,159
you from college.

1114
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:40,120
The one I admired, liked,

1115
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,719
and pursued.

1116
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,279
Even though you were thin,

1117
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:45,440
you were so capable

1118
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,759
and strong.

1119
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,480
Over the years after we got married,

1120
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,600
I've been wrong.

1121
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,120
I've been selfish.

1122
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,159
I took it for granted

1123
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,560
and trapped you in this home,

1124
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,159
making you a housewife.

1125
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,279
I treated you

1126
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,880
as an accessory to the family

1127
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:03,120
and me.

1128
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,279
I sincerely apologize.

1129
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,080
I'm sorry.

1130
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:09,759
You don't need

1131
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:10,960
to apologize to me.

1132
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,080
Being a full-time wife

1133
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,400
was my choice.

1134
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,000
After having kids,

1135
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,440
I just wanted to give them

1136
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,279
a stable home.

1137
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,960
But

1138
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,359
I wasn't satisfied.

1139
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:24,799
No, it's all my fault.

1140
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,400
Well,

1141
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,080
I was wrong.

1142
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,920
I was wrong.

1143
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:32,880
I was wrong.

1144
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,679
Hi, Windy.

1145
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,239
Mr Yu.

1146
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,000
Mr Zhou.

1147
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,040
Why is he here?

1148
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,759
I invited him

1149
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:41,400
to discuss

1150
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,279
the Blue Ocean acquisition.

1151
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,199
Here, take this.

1152
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,120
Mr Zhou.

1153
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,799
I could smell the food from far away.

1154
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:47,920
I came

1155
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,880
at the right time.

1156
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,960
I haven't eaten yet, so I'll

1157
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,279
help myself.

1158
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:52,679
Hey,

1159
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,040
get a chair and tableware.

1160
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,799
Thanks.

1161
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,600
It's an honor

1162
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,639
to have you visit my home.

1163
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,440
No,

1164
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,639
I'm here mainly because of Wendy.

1165
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,520
We had an appointment

1166
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,000
with an investment banker,

1167
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,679
and since she's here,

1168
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,600
I came over.

1169
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,480
That's fine.

1170
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,359
We can eat first

1171
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,199
and

1172
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,120
meet the friend later.

1173
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,560
Okay.

1174
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:25,600
You're back.

1175
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:29,319
Why so many things?

1176
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,759
Mr Zhang bought these for you.

1177
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:34,600
Mr Zhang's here?

1178
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,679
Where's him?

1179
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,040
I didn't let him come up.

1180
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:40,199
What did he buy?

1181
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,120
Sea cucumber.

1182
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Does your hand hurt?

1183
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,279
Hand?

1184
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:47,679
No.

1185
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,480
You pulled her hair?

1186
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,199
How could you hit her?

1187
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:01,880
I...

1188
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,960
I know.

1189
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,199
I...

1190
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,120
I...

1191
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,480
I was so angry and

1192
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,520
couldn't control myself.

1193
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,759
Wendy asked me about

1194
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,839
the Blue Ocean acquisition.

1195
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:13,839
Why wasn't she informed

1196
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:14,279
since she's

1197
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,040
the person in charge?

1198
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,679
Yu, I'm not taking the blame for this.

1199
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:18,679
You discussed it

1200
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,639
with me while you were

1201
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,319
with the kids,

1202
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,199
and I thought it was a good idea.

1203
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,600
But you should have notified

1204
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,679
the direct supervisor right away.

1205
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes.

1206
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,000
Well,

1207
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,600
sorry, Wendy.

1208
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,639
During that time,

1209
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,239
I was dealing with the kids,

1210
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,679
and my mind was a mess.

1211
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,040
Now I've realized

1212
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,480
you've really had

1213
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,040
a tough time with the kids.

1214
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,040
Sorry, Wendy.

1215
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:39,480
You don't need to apologize.

1216
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,199
Uh-oh, Mr Yu,

1217
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,639
you've really offended Wendy.

1218
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,000
Let me tell you,

1219
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,400
she's

1220
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:51,679
ruthless

1221
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:52,920
and vengeful.

1222
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,679
I'm not in charge of

1223
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,239
the project.

1224
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:58,719
If Wendy sabotages you

1225
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,639
in the future,

1226
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,639
I'm not responsible.

1227
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Mr Zhou, you taught me this.

1228
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,679
I'm much kinder than you.

1229
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,520
Have you forgotten

1230
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,960
your nickname in the industry?

1231
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,880
What nickname?

1232
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
Zhou the Benevolent, huh?

1233
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,359
Every project you handle,

1234
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,759
you peel off a layer of skin.

1235
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,440
You are the Skin Peeler.

1236
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,560
Not everyone can be that.

1237
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,560
Skin Peeler?

1238
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,759
Alright, alright, you win.

1239
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:23,600
You win.

Come on.

1241
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,319
Cheers.

1242
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:27,880
Cheers.

1243
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:28,679
Cheers.

1244
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,199
Here.

1245
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,000
Cheers, Wendy.

1246
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,480
Wendy.

1247
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,120
Introduce this chef to me.

1248
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,279
I'll invite him if I'm having

1249
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:40,920
a party next time.

1250
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,319
Okay.

1251
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,319
I'll pass his WeChat

1252
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,040
to your secretary.

1253
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,679
Okay.

1254
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,040
Mr Zhou,

1255
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,120
thank you.

1256
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,839
Thank me for what?

1257
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,839
Last time,

1258
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:50,920
when you and Wanzhen

1259
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,759
were on a business trip

1260
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,000
and it was her birthday,

1261
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,239
you helped me

1262
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:55,480
give her a surprise.

1263
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,920
We joined you

1264
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,400
with the kids.

1265
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,560
It's nothing.

1266
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,400
Just

1267
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:01,600
a small favor.

1268
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,319
Wanzhen missed the kids

1269
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,440
and I needed to see you

1270
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,679
so I called you.

1271
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,159
Just like that.

1272
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,600
I thought

1273
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,799
you were helping us.

1274
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,120
Helping you?

1275
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,600
I want to reconcile with Wanzhen.

1276
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,359
I can see that.

1277
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,319
But it

1278
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,080
depends on her thought.

1279
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,679
I hope

1280
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:24,920
she thinks so.

1281
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,600
I'm still working on it.

1282
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,319
Mr Yu, some things

1283
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,960
can't be achieved just by working.

1284
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,080
It

1285
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,239
depends on Wanzhen's attitude.

1286
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,080
Yes.

1287
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:38,000
After all, we have

1288
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,839
two daughters.

1289
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,560
And I will also

1290
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,159
respect

1291
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,679
her work decisions

1292
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,600
and support her

1293
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:49,600
in doing a good job.

1294
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:52,520
It seems you really

1295
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,000
want to reconcile with her.

1296
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,040
In that case,

1297
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:56,679
I won't help you

1298
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,520
again.

1299
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,520
I'll even advise Wanzhen

1300
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,480
not to reconcile with you.
