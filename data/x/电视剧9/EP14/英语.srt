3
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,470
I've been worrying

4
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,600
about it, the moment

5
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,120
you told me the news.

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,120
By then, I thought that

7
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,600
it's not the right time to speak out.

8
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,910
An just got pregnant

9
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,120
and you don't even know it's gender...

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,470
I don't care about it.

11
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,350
Neither do I.

12
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,190
I'm just saying, now, it still

13
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,470
is an embryo

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,710
and you want to,

15
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,910
you know, An's telling him...

16
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,070
it's not...we should do this.

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,400
What would

18
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,320
Li Lin think?

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,800
He's a good man.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
I believe

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,310
he would agree.

22
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,400
You know nothing about men.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,030
Listen to me,

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,680
men and women are

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,150
thinking differently.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
You don't really know

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,960
what he's thinking, right?

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
Of course, I don't.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,270
Okay.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,310
Well,

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
you'll pretend An,

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
and I'll be Li Lin.

33
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,080
Then,

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,990
you reveal the proposal of yours.

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,520
What...

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,150
- What are you...
- Well.

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,870
Listen

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,310
to me firstly.

39
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,310
I just want to show you

40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,200
what would Li Lin do.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,550
Then, you wouldn't blame An for it.

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,990
Remember, we are staging a drama,

43
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,990
not the musical we did

44
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,800
when we were young,

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,030
with singing and dancing.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
That's musical.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,080
Understood?

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Alright.

49
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll do it.

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,430
But only once.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,120
OK.

52
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,680
And keep it down.

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,200
Or, others would think

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,520
we're mental.

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,120
OK.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,150
Good.

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,550
Alright. Let's do it here.

58
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm Li Lin.

59
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,990
Go.

60
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,830
You'll approach from there.

61
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,030
You're An, remember.

62
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,990
I didn't

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,590
say action!

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,270
I need to pose like I'm thinking.

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,830
Li Lin.

66
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,200
An.

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,960
There's something I want to tell you.

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
You left work early. What's wrong?

69
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,360
Well, we're about to

70
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,990
have our second child, right?

71
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,870
I was thinking that

72
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,750
maybe,

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,480
he or she would take my last name.

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,520
You agree, right?

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,270
Told you...

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,750
An,

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,480
are you out of your mind?

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,520
Stop talking nonsense.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
Why would our child take your family name?

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,030
Remember my name?

81
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,590
L-I, Li.

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,990
I'm Li Lin.

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,270
Man of the house.

84
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,550
Yeah, I know.

85
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,550
Then, what do you mean?

86
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,200
Whose idea is this?

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Yours?

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,270
Your father's?

89
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,200
Your mother's?

90
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,360
Or, your whole family agree with it?

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,480
Stop it!

92
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,240
So, you think

93
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,200
I couldn't provide a good life

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,990
for the child, right?

95
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,640
You think I can't support family?

96
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,430
It's not what you think.

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,240
What is it, then?

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,590
Then, why,

99
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,590
why does my kid to take your family name?

100
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,950
But our neighbor, Wang,

101
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,430
the second child of her daughter

102
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,800
took his name.

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,240
Wang?

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
What's this got to do with him?

105
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,430
Why should we do as his daughter do?

106
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,630
The Wangs' life has nothing to do with us!

107
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,720
You believe I can't afford my family?

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,950
What are you talking about?

109
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,510
Do you think that

110
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm living off your family?!

111
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,280
Keep it down.

112
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,990
Am I living

113
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,160
off your family?

114
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,680
It's not what I mean.

115
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
Am I a loser who depends on my wife?

116
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,190
No...How could you even think like that?

117
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,360
How could you think like that!

118
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,280
It must be your father's idea.

119
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,630
He's over 60

120
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,280
and doesn't have a son.

121
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,040
Is he?

122
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,120
He goes on and on about

123
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,800
how pathetic he is, because he doesn't have a son

124
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,950
and nobody would take care of him.

125
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,390
Once he knows we have the second child,

126
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,510
he wants the kid to take his name.

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,510
Don't even think about it!

128
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,280
No way!

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,750
It's irrational!

130
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,600
It's ridiculous!

131
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,550
It's preposterous!

132
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,510
Enough!

133
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,950
See?

134
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,630
That's what Li Lin would do.

135
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,190
This

136
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,190
will

137
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,870
build a wall between

138
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,870
us and our in-laws.

139
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,480
They would think

140
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,510
that we're

141
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,360
causing troubles.

142
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,190
We're selfish

143
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,600
and think only about what we want,

144
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,240
not what our children want.

145
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,390
Alright. That's it.

146
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,430
You are the thoughtful one, okay?

147
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,800
That's not what I mean.

148
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,280
I'm worrying about our daughter.

149
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,840
Between her parents and husband,

150
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,950
between her two families,

151
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,600
what could she do?

152
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,800
It would be a mess.

153
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,950
So, all in all,

154
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,680
in the end,

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,750
that's my fault.

156
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,480
You did this for me.

157
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,240
Of course, I did this for you.

158
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,480
Yeah. Though I'm the man of the house,

159
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,430
anything happen isn't up to me,

160
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,990
it's up to you.

161
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,390
Look, this one is on me.

162
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,750
So, don't feel bad.

163
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,630
I'm not. Why should I?

164
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:44,950
This is...

165
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,950
I'm telling you,

166
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,430
there's plenty of time.

167
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
I still have chance

168
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,950
to convince them.

169
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,430
Maybe they'll agree.

170
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,870
Such a time wasting.

171
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
What did you say?

172
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,070
Time wasting?

173
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,950
I did this for you!

174
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,480
For your family!

175
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
For the Xus!

176
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,600

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
[Slow down.]

178
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,720
[Careful.]

179
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,190
[Take it slow.]

180
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,310
[Careful.]

181
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,600
[Happy now?]

182
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,680
[Yeah.]

183
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
[Let's get some treats for you.]

184
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,040
An,

185
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,950
what do you want to do with the turtle?

186
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,920
How about we ask him when he comes back?

187
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,280
Then, I'll make some flapjacks for you.

188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,390
Li Lin can do anything but flapjacks!

189
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,550
Well, I can!

190
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,120
Just give me a few minutes.

191
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,750
Okay.

192
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
Turtle and flapjacks,

193
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,390
marvelous.

194
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,750
What's this?

195
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,190
[Slow down.]

196
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,430
[Careful.]

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,510
[Happy now?]

198
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,550
[Yeah.]

199
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,920
[Let's get some treats for you.]

200
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,120
What are you doing here?

201
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,630
What do you want this time?

202
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,950
An,

203
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,840
this time is real.

204
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,280
Just, stop being

205
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,190
so suspicious.

206
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,870
I'm not!

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
I know this woman.

208
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,390
She's Jia's ex.

209
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,600
They'd been together for years.

210
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,920
Where are they now?

211
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,390
Is it possible that

212
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,480
these kids are Jia Haowen's?

213
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,990
I don't think so.

214
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
If you're so concerned about it,

215
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,840
let's take a closer look.

216
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,030
If you have any question,

217
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,560
just ask them face-to-face.

218
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
If the kids are his,

219
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,670
what should I do?

220
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,390
Leave him.

221
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,790
Take everything he has.

222
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,390
There is no other way.

223
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,790
How about

224
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,790
you wait here,

225
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,840
and I'll go in there.

226
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,150
No, I'll go.

227
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,080
He's my husband.

228
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,840
I need to go.

229
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,960
Well,

230
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,960
Xin,

231
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,360
just think about it.

232
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,390
If

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
you see things you shouldn't see,

234
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,200
what would you do?

235
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,360
Tear him apart.

236
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,990
Xin,

237
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,720
An,

238
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,560
what are you doing here?

239
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,390
What are you doing here?

240
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,360
Nothing.

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,630
In a meeting with...

242
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,240
Jia Haowen!

243
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,870
For all years, you've been lying to me!

244
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,990
You told me, you haven't had

245
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,910
contact with her for years!

246
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,200
Xin,

247
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,840
what are you talking about?!

248
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,510
What are you doing?

249
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,200
Why are you filming?

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,390
Don't touch my sister!

251
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,080
Who are you?

252
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,270
I'm his wife! Who are you?

253
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,910
That's it. Xin.

254
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,840
What are you doing here!?

255
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,240
[What are you talking about?!]

256
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,990
[Xin, you're mistaken.]

257
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,480
Get out!

258
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,510
What?

259
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,720
You are here alone with my husband!

260
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,030
Take your sister, get out of here!

261
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,200
Who do you think you are!

262
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,600
Xin, you're misreading the situation.

263
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,270
[Jia Haowen!]

264
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Do you beg

265
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,270
my whole family here, just to

266
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,720
humiliate us?

267
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,240
No, it's not like that.

268
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,910
Nobody begs you here!

269
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,480
Bah!

270
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,560
Whose kids are they?

271
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:02,960
Xin...

272
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,910
Their father is not your concern.

273
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,720
Xin, you misunderstand.

274
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,630
[I'm not leaving!]

275
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,480
What's wrong?

276
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,360
Jia Haowen!

277
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,510
You begged me here,

278
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,510
so I came, with my husband,

279
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,790
for the cooperation you mentioned.

280
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,960
How dare you to humiliate us like this?

281
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,390
It's not...Xin...

282
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,240
Get out! Now!

283
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,270
Sorry, bro.

284
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,600
My wife, she has depression.

285
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:17,960
It's caused by her pregnancy...

286
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,750
I don't have depression!

287
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,320
That's how you

288
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,630
treat your guests, right?

289
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,390
Great! Really great.

290
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:21,870
Leave, Jia Haowen.

291
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,360
We should go now.

292
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,360
What are you hollering for?

293
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,390
You are making troubles out of nothing!

294
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:24,990
Trouble my a*s.

295
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,270
Stop yelling!

296
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,790
Chill. Chill.

297
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,480
Carry her out! Now!

298
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,030
I'm so sorry. We made a mistake.

299
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,960
Save it!

300
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,560
We don't need your apology!

301
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,120
[Out!]

302
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,270
No! You get out!

303
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,670
[What's wrong with you!]

304
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,750
[Jia Haowen!]

305
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,630
[You lose!]

306
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,120
[Remember what]

307
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,360
[did you tell me?]

308
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
You promised that

309
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,840
you haven't contacted her for ten years!

310
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,390
You called that 'haven't contacted'?

311
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,990
You are seeing each other!

312
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,270
Furthermore,

313
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,200
you held her kids as they were your own!

314
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,630
What were you thinking?

315
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,150
How did you know it?

316
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,080
She hired someone to watch you.

317
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
When was that?

318
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,990
None of your business!

319
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,240
What? You don't want to be watched by me?

320
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,360
I want to. Please watch me.

321
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,390
Since I can look through your phone

322
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,200
I also can watch you whenever I want!

323
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,910
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

324
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,270
Of course you should watch me, honey.

325
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,200
Just tell me,

326
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
do you regret to marry me

327
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,840
so you invited her here,

328
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,840
even though she's already married?

329
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Please,

330
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
tell her it's not what you mean

331
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
and she will let it go.

332
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,030
An,

333
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,080
I swear to god,

334
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,510
I've never regret!

335
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,360
This is...

336
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,360
Those two are kind of

337
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,270
big shot in the trading industry.

338
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,670
I begged them to here and work with me.

339
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,030
There are many big shots

340
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,870
in that industry,

341
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,990
why didn't you ask others to come?

342
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,360
I believe there are always other choices.

343
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,750
Why did you choose your ex?

344
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,870
Don't you have other choices?

345
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,080
Are other people all dead?

346
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,990
Stop there.

347
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,120
Really, that's enough.

348
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,480
So,

349
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,870
can we do something to fix it?

350
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,240
Fix it?

351
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
How?

352
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,480
It's done. I'm done.

353
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,840
Just, forget about it.

354
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,870
If you say so.

355
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,120
Actually, Xin's concern is

356
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
reasonable.

357
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,150
Yes, I know.

358
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:15,990
I did make

359
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,200
an ill-considered decision.

360
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,030
In fact, I'm happy that

361
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,200
she yelled at me for that.

362
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,080
Happy? What for?

363
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,720
She did that

364
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,360
because she loves me too much.

365
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
You two are just

366
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,030
perfect to each other.

367
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,120
Alright.

368
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,990
I'll take care of her.

369
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,080
You can go now.

370
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
So, I'll leave her in your hands.

371
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,840
Just go.

372
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,560
Leave her to me.

373
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,600
Thank you so much, An.

374
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,200
Go.

375
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,600
Where are you going, Jia Haowen?

376
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,120
Ask yourself.

377
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,870
I'm not finished here!

378
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,600
[Enough.]

379
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Stop it!

380
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,870
I'm not finished!

381
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,790
Where is he going?

382
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,480
What's to finish?

383
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,360
You said enough.

384
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,510
You found him

385
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,600
and the truth,

386
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
what else do you want?

387
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,720
Let's go home.

388
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,240
I want to go to mom and dad's.

389
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,390
What? After torturing your poor husband,

390
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,510
your poor parents become your next target?

391
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,670
What do you want?

392
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,360
Is this not enough?

393
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,270
Get in the car.

394
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,990
We can go.

395
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,030
Alright.

396
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,390
Calm down.

397
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm sorry, OK?

398
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
I know

399
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,720
you don't mean to apologize.

400
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,030
C'mon, I do!

401
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,440
You are glowing

402
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,990
once you know Jia doesn't have an affair.

403
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,560
And you still want to hear my apology.

404
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Tell me,

405
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,270
whose last name

406
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,270
would your second child choose?

407
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,270
What do you mean?

408
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,670
What to choose?

409
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,440
Jia, of course.

410
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,840
What's wrong with you?

411
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,670
Are you saying

412
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,840
just because I suspect my man has an affair,

413
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,560
I have an affair myself?

414
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,990
No. That's not what I mean.

415
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,360
I'm just wondering,

416
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,270
have you ever thought

417
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,360
to let the kid take another last name.

418
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,440
What else could the kid take?

419
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,630
Like,

420
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,720
Xu?

421
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,990
Why?

422
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,960
I'm an emotional challenge and I know it.

423
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,030
But, I know

424
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,750
right and wrong.

425
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,510
The child's surname

426
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,790
must be the same as the dad's.

427
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,440
So, mum didn't ask you?

428
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,670
For what?

429
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,560
Did she tell you that?

430
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,750
No.

431
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,360
Or,

432
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,600
she's asking too much from me.

433
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,360
Pushing me around 'cause I'm her daughter.

434
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,480
Then, why did you ask me about it?

435
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,790
Trying to ease the tension.

436
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,720
In your dreams.

437
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
Sir, go faster.

438
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,510
OK.

439
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
It's the progesterone.

440
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,630
It's the progesterone talking.

441
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,630
Not my sister.

442
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,870
It's all progesterone's fault.

443
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,440
And she's talking out loud.

444
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,990
Does she think I'm deaf?

445
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,670
Auntie, I'm home.

446
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,870
Smells good.

447
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,200
Yeah. Smells so good.

448
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,750
What are you cooking?

449
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,510
Wash your hands first.

450
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,670
What's in the pot?

451
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,670
Turtle soup.

452
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,440
Gross.

453
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,120
What soup?

454
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,320
Lanxiang,

455
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,960
Meng'an told me about your decision.

456
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,080
You can stay here and work for us,

457
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,270
there's no need to worry.

458
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,670
I was going to tell you about this.

459
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,360
If you don't want to hire me,

460
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,240
feel free to tell me.

461
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,360
I want to.

462
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm happy you're here.

463
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,670
After all, you're my cousin.

464
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,750
Relax.

465
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,600
Lin,

466
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,560
you're still the boy I know.

467
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,750
Such a nice man.

468
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,270
So, it's turtle soup.

469
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,440
Turtle,

470
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,200
nice.

471
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,270
How much is it?

472
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,910
I didn't buy it.

473
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,270
Your in-laws came.

474
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,390
They brought the turtle.

475
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,480
They were here?

476
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,200
They said Meng'an needs more nutrients.

477
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,670
You mean,

478
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,230
she's home when they came?

479
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,950
Yes.

480
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,190
I'll leave you alone.

481
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,230
Honey.

482
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,120
[Honey,]

483
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,190
[when will you be back?]

484
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,670
It may take a while.

485
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,520
I'm at Xin's home.

486
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,360
I know.

487
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,360
But the turtle is ready.

488
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,950
Should we wait for you?

489
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,600
No. You go ahead

490
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,360
and eat without me.

491
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,520
Bye.

492
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,430
Hello?

493
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,120
You've never on my side,

494
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,390
always supporting other people.

495
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,710
I don't want to talk to you.

496
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,230
I want mum.

497
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,710
Alright. Calm down.

498
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,630
Stop crying.

499
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Of course I'm on your side.

500
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,040
I'm your sister.

501
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm always stand by your side.

502
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,390
Didn't you see the truth, today?

503
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,320
Your beloved

504
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,670
brother-in-law

505
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,800
has been lying to

506
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,950
and hiding things from me.

507
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,560
He treats me like a fool.

508
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,040
You want to hear the truth?

509
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,710
No.

510
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,390
Well, I'll still tell you.

511
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,840
No one

512
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,430
is perfect.

513
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,190
Jia Haowen's fault is

514
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,430
that he contacted with his ex

515
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,430
without telling you first.

516
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,000
He didn't do it right, yes.

517
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,630
But,

518
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,000
you saw it yourself,

519
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,230
he didn't betray you

520
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,390
or do anything wrong,

521
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,630
you have to admit it,

522
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,670
right?

523
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,470
But you,

524
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,630
you'd never trusted him.

525
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,080
You hired someone to follow him.

526
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,910
It's illegal,

527
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,190
you know?

528
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,910
Think about it.

529
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,470
Between you and him,

530
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,760
who's worse?

531
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,670
He is. Definitely.

532
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,430
Lying is the worst crime.

533
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,760
Do you want to

534
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,670
enjoy your marriage or not?

535
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,390
You are yelling at me. Again.

536
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,630
He lied to me and you blame me.

537
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,040
Are you really my sister?

538
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,190
I am.

539
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,600
If I'm not,

540
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,670
I wouldn't be here with you.

541
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
What else do you want?

542
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,390
You followed him,

543
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,230
interrupted his meeting,

544
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,190
and found nothing.

545
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,190
What else can you do?

546
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,950
Can you just cut these farces out

547
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,190
and build a life with your husband?

548
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,120
Will you,

549
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,190
Xin?

550
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,560
He...

551
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,950
he didn't blame me for my investigation,

552
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,390
maybe because he's guilty of something.

553
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,560
Maybe,

554
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,000
he's hiding a lot of things

555
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,080
from me, today's meeting

556
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,230
is merely the tip of the iceberg.

557
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,840
How many exes does Jia have?

558
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,190
He told me he has only one.

559
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,430
I don't believe it.

560
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,320
See?

561
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,190
You don't believe him, either!

562
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,520
An,

563
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,910
is it possible

564
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,670
that

565
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,280
Jia paid off the paparazzi I hired

566
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,280
and hid

567
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,560
videos with real problems.

568
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,120
By giving me

569
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,280
videos I watched today,

570
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,760
he's trying to conceal bigger problems?

571
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,670
Stop making up stories.

572
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,760
Hello.

573
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,320
[Hello.]

574
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,630
Can you tell me the class schedule

575
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,360
of your training program for

576
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,470
CIA, SAC

577
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,710
and Securities Sales tests?

578
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,390
[There are classes from Monday to Friday.]

579
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,470
How about Saturday?

580
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:35,870
[There is no class on Saturday.]

581
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,600
Okay, I see.

582
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,120
I'll think about it. Thank you.

583
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:40,870
[OK.]

584
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,360
Wanzhen,

585
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,390
Fei and Wu,

586
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,520
later, our regional manager will give

587
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,670
some friends of him a room tour.

588
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Get prepared.

589
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,800
Wanzhen,

590
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,760
you'll responsible for entertaining

591
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,630
guests and room tour planning.

592
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,710
Got it.

593
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,840
Wanzhen,

594
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,320
I think it's time for you

595
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,360
to take your kids home.

596
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,670
Wanzhen,

597
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,230
any problems?

598
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,280
No. I got it all figured out.

599
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,040
Good.

600
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,390
Go get ready.

601
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,360
Dinner is served!

602
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,470
Time to eat!

603
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,910
Lanxiang,

604
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,320
I need to pick up Meng'an.

605
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,430
You can eat without us.

606
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,870
Yunjie,

607
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,120
I made some rice cakes for you,

608
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,390
do you want to have some?

609
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,360
[I'll wait for my parents to eat together.]

610
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,840
Hi, auntie.

611
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,430
Miss Chen.

612
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,080
Today, I may return

613
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,630
after 9 o'clock.

614
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,390
Miss Chen,

615
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,870
I have other arrangements.

616
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,230
I'll double your salary.

617
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,600
It's not about the money.

618
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,080
We agreed that

619
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,560
I would work until 7 o'clock every day.

620
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,390
[In fact,]

621
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,760
[I need to go to another house.]

622
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,360
[They are waiting for me.]

623
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,150
Your kids

624
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,190
are both cuties

625
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,360
and always well-behaved.

626
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,430
They should be fine

627
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,360
to stay home alone for only 2 hours.

628
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,760
Mum,

629
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,000
we got 100 in the test.

630
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,560
[Mine is better.]

631
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,800
You are amazing!

632
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,230
Mum,

633
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,760
when will you be home?

634
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,320
Wanzhen,

635
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,360
hurry up.

636
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,950
Clients are on their way.

637
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,840
Got it.

638
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,320
Auntie,

639
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,670
I'll get someone to take over the kids.

640
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,950
Great.

641
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,190
Come,

642
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,280
do your homework.

643
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,760
OK.

644
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,950
Your mother will be back soon.

645
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,630
We know.

646
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,190
Alright.

647
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,470
Yunjie,

648
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,360
have the rice cakes when they're hot.

649
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,230
What are you doing?

650
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,560
The school is planning

651
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,950
a donation to kids in west mountain areas.

652
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,760
Donation?

653
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,390
You'll give this away?

654
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,360
Yeah.

655
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,630
This is beautiful.

656
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,430
It's barely used.

657
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,670
It's charity, not throwing garbage.

658
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,150
Chari...

659
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,870
Yunjie,

660
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,230
can you

661
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,320
give these bright coats

662
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
to me?

663
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,630
You'll wear them?

664
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,120
No,

665
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,430
for your cousin Pingping.

666
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,080
She's about your height.

667
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,230
About my height?

668
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,870
How old is she?

670
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,080
20 years old?

671
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,910
Are you kidding?

672
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,190
These coats are overly childish to me,

673
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,040
let alone her.

674
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,800
No,

675
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,760
they're not childish.

676
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,910
They are beautiful.

677
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,150
See, there's a cute bunny here.

678
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
And the colour...

679
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,560
These would fit her well. Really.

680
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,630
Yunjie,

681
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,840
you know,

682
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,630
my hometown is also

683
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,390
in the mountain areas.

684
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,280
You can

685
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,040
directly give these to me.

686
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,190
Right?

687
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,760
Well, you can have all of them.

688
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,360
Thank you.

689
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,630
Thank you so much.

690
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,470
Look,

691
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,670
this one seems fit for me, huh?

692
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,000
An,

693
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,190
thank you for putting in

694
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,320
so much effort for me.

695
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,950
Here, have some.

696
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,760
No, thanks.

697
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,360
I have turtle soup at home.

698
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,470
This is way better than that.

699
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,800
You are in the first trimester,

700
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,950
you can't be upset.

701
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,950
No need to get serious about me.

702
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,470
You are one of the people

703
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,840
I should get serious about.

704
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,190
I'm sorry.

705
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,630
I'll go to

706
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,230
see a shrink tomorrow.

707
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,040
My obstetrician

708
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,600
already suggested me to do so.

709
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,390
But you can't blame me for my hysteria.

710
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,190
If I didn't to do so,

711
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,360
I wouldn't know

712
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,670
the other side of Jia.

713
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,710
What else do you want to know?

714
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,950
To know that my dear hubby

715
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,390
is not getting back together

716
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,190
with his ex-girlfriend.

717
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,470
They are just working together.

718
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
By spoiling their cooperation?

719
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,630
My hubby has other

720
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,950
business partners.

721
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,150
Besides,

722
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,760
I believe Jia would

723
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,280
see all these fusses

724
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
as symbols of love

725
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,040
and caring.

726
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,840
I'm telling you,

727
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,710
loyalty maybe normal

728
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,040
in average middle-class families,

729
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,950
but definitely a rarity in

730
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,150
families like ours.

731
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
It's hard.

732
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,630
So, you should

733
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,630
cherish Jia, right?

734
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,000
Alright.

735
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,670
Then, drop the paparazzi

736
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,670
you're hiring. Now.

737
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,470
Will do.

738
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,950
You said so last time I asked.

739
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,560
There were balance in my account.

740
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
But they're used up.

741
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,390
Don't renew the service.

742
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,520
Will not.

743
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,840
Promise.

744
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,470
Nice, right?

745
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,630
Turtle soup is better.

746
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,870
This way please.

747
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,760
Welcome.

748
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,870
Please, have some tea.

749
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,430
Okay, thank you.

750
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,600
Here you are.

751
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,150
Right?

752
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,870
So, it's much cheaper if you pay now,

753
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,560
isn't it?

754
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,950
Hello? What?

755
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,190
[Chen Wanzhen, where are you?]

756
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,360
Such a great mother you are!

757
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,950
If I didn't call the kids,

758
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,520
I wouldn't know

759
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,080
they are home alone.

760
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,390
I have work to do,

761
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,560
will be back soon.

762
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,910
The girls already had their dinner.

763
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm not talking about dinner!

764
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,800
They are still children.

765
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,870
You can not

766
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,600
leave them alone at home.

767
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,870
[What if the house is on fire?]

768
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,040
[Or, there is a break-in?]

769
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,670
What if a sudden power failure

770
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,080
scared the kids?

771
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,190
I'm telling you,

772
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,230
whatever you're doing,

773
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,360
drop it.

774
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,560
Go back and take care of the kids.

775
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,470
I'll be back

776
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,600
once my job is done.

777
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,360
Career or kids,

778
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,950
you can't have both.

779
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,120
[Just think about it.]

780
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,760
[If you can't take care of them,]

781
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,630
I'll fly to

782
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,670
your home

783
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,000
and take the custody from you.

784
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,280
Xin.

785
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,630
Lin,

786
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,000
come on in.

787
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,190
You two,

788
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,630
stay and have dinner with me.

789
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:39,840
Thank you for asking.

790
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,390
But, at home, our meal is already served.

791
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,190
Yunjie is also at home

792
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,600
waiting for us.

793
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,760
Xiong's having classes now.

794
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,230
I don't want to eat alone.

795
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,390
That's pathetic.

796
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,950
Pathetic?

797
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,950
You're envy us?

798
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,870
Then, try to control your emotions,

799
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,710
OK?

800
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,950
Later, when Jia's back,

801
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,670
be nice to him

802
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,760
and ask for his forgiveness.

803
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,670
Let's go.

804
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,470
Good night.

805
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,390
You take care.

806
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,040
Drive safe.

807
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,360
Where is Xiong?

808
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,430
The diver is going to pick him up.

809
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,080
Where is the master?

810
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,360
He said you should eat without him.

811
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,230
Without him.

812
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,870
I want to apologize while eating...

813
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Without him...

814
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,360
He'd better never come back!

815
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,470
I swear,

816
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,190
I'm out of their

817
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,000
family drama forever.

818
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,840
They have issues!

819
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,560
A drama queen

820
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,950
and her knight. What a pair!

821
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,630
You know,

822
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,190
Xin hired a paparazzi spying on Jia.

823
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,800
Do you know

824
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
what he said after finding out?

825
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,280
He said, that's because Xin loves him.

826
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,320
What can

827
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,760
I say?

828
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm sorry

829
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,360
or thank you for tolerating Xin?

830
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,710
She really is

831
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,280
overly dramatic.

832
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,600
[In my opinion, you shouldn't]

833
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,360
[intervene in the beginning.]

834
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,600
They are in love,

835
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,600
right?

836
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,280
Means they are the same kind of people.

837
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,390
[Fire needs air, right?]

838
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,360
You're overreacted.

839
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,000
She called

840
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,910
and you ran to her side to avenge her.

841
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,360
Well... I'm her sister.

842
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:55,870
Still, you should

843
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,870
understand the situation first,

844
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,320
right?

845
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,630
How

846
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,120
about I go to talk

847
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,080
to Jia, if you don't want to speak out.

848
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,390
I'll tell him,

849
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,600
to care more about his wife.

850
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,320
It's not right to

851
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,560
bother my wife with his problems,

852
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,390
right?

853
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,430
[You're my wife]

854
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,430
and I'm worried about you.

855
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,840
Besides, you're pregnant.

856
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,760
[They can always call for]

857
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,760
family counseling

858
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,710
if there is problem.

859
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,280
When family counseling doesn't work,

860
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,120
they can call the police.

861
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,870
Great idea.

862
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,230
They should call the police for help.

863
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,630
Yes.

864
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
Slow down. You may choke yourself.

865
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,800
There still are plenty of them.

866
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,390
These are so good.

867
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,470
You like it?

868
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,840
I'll make them for you later.

869
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,910
Auntie,

870
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,760
why didn't you send Pingping to school?

871
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,190
She's a girl.

872
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,910
Girls need to learn nothing,

873
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,190
but how to have a successful marriage.

874
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,150
But, she has the right to

875
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,470
education.

876
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,320
Boys and girls are equal on the education.

877
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,910
You can't force her to sacrifice for brother.

878
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,950
What?

879
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,320
Sacrifice.

880
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,600
Means she gives up her future,

881
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,950
to support her younger brother.

882
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,320
That's unfair.

883
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,470
That's all older sisters' duty.

884
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,390
Your father's older sister

885
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,840
sacrificed for him when he was young.

886
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,470
I remember that

887
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,390
your father was bullied by other kids.

888
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,320
They laughed at his mother was not round.

889
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,910
He was furious and sad.

890
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,630
His snot became a

891
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,120
perfect bridge between his nose and mouth while crying.

892
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,000
When your aunt came back from work,

893
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,910
she waved a huge needle

894
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,080
and chased down

895
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,560
those bad boys.

896
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,190
One of them got so scared,

897
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,910
[that he peed on himself.]

898
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,080
Your father was so happy after that.

899
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,800
My aunt was so cool.

900
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Cool as hell.

901
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,870
That's what a sister would do.

902
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,390
[You don't understand the feeling.]

903
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,470
But when your mother

904
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,670
give birth to the second child,

905
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,080
you will.

906
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,120
They didn't tell you?

907
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,630
Yunjie, where are you going?

908
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,520
Liars!

909
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,230
Where are you going?

910
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,670
What happened?

911
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,120
An,

912
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,000
I let it slip

913
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,800
that you're pregnant.

914
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,600
[Liars!]

915
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,430
They are all liars!

916
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,630
[Everybody knows,]

917
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,120
[but me,]

918
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:34,950
[the hell?]

919
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,670
[Liars!]

920
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,320
They are all liars!

921
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,760
Everybody knows,

922
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but me,

923
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,800
the hell?

924
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,040
Always told me to be true,

925
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,950
yet they are full of it!

926
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,320
Can't they trust me a little?

927
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,910
A pack of lying hypocrites!

928
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,190
One wouldn't kick up a fuss,

929
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,080
when one have truly been hurt.

930
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,600
Yunjie,

931
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,910
chill up.

932
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,710
I was

933
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,670
in your position, too.

934
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,600
Actually, you are better than me.

935
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,600
My parents didn't

936
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,000
told me until the baby was born.

937
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,390
They told me that

938
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,470
my mother was just gaining some harmless weight.

939
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,320
Because of that,

940
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,910
for a long while, I thought

941
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,080
middle-aged spread means to suddenly rise like a balloon.

942
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,190
We are family.

943
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,120
Why can't they

944
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
tell me the truth?

945
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,390
I thought there is no secret between us!

946
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,800
I was told that you're sick

947
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,760
and needed more rest!

948
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,560
I believed you and was so worried!

949
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,470
What? I need to be honest

950
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,760
while you lie all the time?!

951
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,080
That's what adults do.

952
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,470
I thought

953
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,870
you're hiding it from Jing

954
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,470
and An's parents.

955
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,150
[I didn't know]

956
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,710
[you didn't tell Yunjie.]

957
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,350
I'm so sorry.

958
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,600
I'll take her home.

959
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,000
I called He Lu's father,

960
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,790
Yunjie's there.

961
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,880
Don't.

962
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,400
She'll know it eventually.

963
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,830
But this is all very sudden...

964
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,080
So, you need to calm down.

965
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,270
For now, leave her alone.

966
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,920
Give her space to let off.

967
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,670
She'll feel better after.

968
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Later, I'll go and pick her up.

969
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,400
Lanxiang,

970
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,190
it's not your fault.

971
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,920
We were

972
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
planning to tell her

973
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,270
in a couple of days.

974
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:45,710
It's alright.

975
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,600
She just got the news earlier.

976
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,520
Let's eat.

977
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,600
It's dinner time.

978
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,670
What an amazing appetite you have!

979
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,480
Yet, my daughter may not

980
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,400
have eaten anything.

981
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,350
I'm sure her appetite is better than mine.

982
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,350
The baby is an accident.

983
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,400
They said she almost lost it some days ago.

984
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,710
I don't know why they hide it from me.

985
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,270
Maybe,

986
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,190
they haven't made up their mind,

987
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,040
so they didn't tell me.

988
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,920
Honey, you're so sweet.

989
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,920
Don't rationalize their lies.

990
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,790
You really

991
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,080
should change your name

992
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,670
into Li Sweet.

993
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,560
How did you feel when you knew

994
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,600
you got a baby brother?

995
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,080
Like hell.

996
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,480
Oh,

997
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,230
your baby brother,

998
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,960
it's still an embryo, isn't it?

999
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,630
What do you mean?

1000
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,670
I mean, you can stop the progress!

1001
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,120
Just ask your mother

1002
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,310
to give up on that embryo.

1003
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,600
I don't think that's a good idea.

1004
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,920
In fact,

1005
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
I'm angry because they lied to me.

1006
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,880
I don't

1007
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,920
dislike the idea to have a sibling.

1008
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,310
Wait till he comes out.

1009
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,310
You'll regret.

1010
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,920
I want it to be a sister.

1011
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,960
It will be too late

1012
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,710
when you realize

1013
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,120
that your parents

1014
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,710
are not care about

1015
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,270
and loving you

1016
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,000
like before.

1017
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,350
I just called

1018
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:29,960
your father

1019
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,270
and you both heard it.

1020
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,150
I'm really sent by your father

1021
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,270
to look after you.

1022
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,790
Then, open up.

1023
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,670
No.

1024
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,190
I don't know you.

1025
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,230
Mum said that

1026
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,480
we shouldn't let strangers get in our home.

1027
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,830
These are my working ID and ID card.

1028
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,230
I'm really here to look after you.

1029
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,190
Your cards can't prove

1030
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,750
that you're not a bad person.

1031
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,350
Sorry.

1032
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,920
We can't let you in.

1033
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,520
Hello?

1034
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,960
Are you calling Chen Wanzhen's home?

1035
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,750
Yes.

1036
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,600
The kids' father is my boss.

1037
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,880
He sent me to babysit them.

1038
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,960
But they refuse to let me in.

1039
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,960
These are my working ID and ID card.

1040
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,480
Can I take a better look of them?

1041
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,880
Excuse me.

1042
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,350
Okay, thank you.

1043
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,480
Just a minute, please.

1044
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,710
Wan, Zhen,

1045
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,480
it's me,

1046
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,480
the doctor?

1047
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,790
So, I just confirmed that this young lady

1048
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,750
is truly the babysitter

1049
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,830
sent by your father.

1050
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,000
I checked everything already.

1051
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:27,830
How about

1052
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,150
I go up

1053
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,670
with her?

1054
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,560
I bought some fruits,

1055
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,190
we can share them together.

1056
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,480
OK.

1057
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,750
Yes.

1058
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,480
Good.

1059
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's go.

1060
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,560
Thank you.

1061
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,750
[The door's open.]

1062
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,600
Mum, I'm home.

1063
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,150
You're back.

1064
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,080
Here,

1065
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
tell me,

1066
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,750
does any kids

1067
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,710
in your class, whose parents

1068
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,830
are divorced?

1069
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,270
Yes.

1070
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,600
Howze transferred to

1071
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,920
another kindergarten

1072
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,440
because his parents divorced.

1073
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,120
He was my best friend.

1074
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,960
Don't divorce, please.

1075
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,710
Dad, I don't want it.

1076
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,440
We'll not.

1077
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,120
No.

1078
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,630
I don't want it, mum.

1079
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,670
Xin, why did you...

1080
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,350
It's alright.

1081
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,120
Sweetheart,

1082
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,790
don't cry.

1083
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,270
It's okay. Honey.

1084
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,630
My good boy.

1085
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,120
Put down your things.

1086
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:47,920
It's okay.

1087
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,480
Come here,

1088
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,350
come.

1089
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,960
I thought you're taking me home.

1090
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,350
Why we're here?

1091
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,040
I want to make a small talk with you.

1092
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,120
I don't want.

1093
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,270
Girl, when I propose something,

1094
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,400
you'd better accept it.

1095
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,960
How can you do this to me, mother?

1096
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,880
How can you blame me

1097
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,560
for lying

1098
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,230
and then lie to me

1099
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,120
all the time?

1100
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,960
Human beings are complicated.

1101
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,710
And the complication grows with age.

1102
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I, too, hate what I am now.

1103
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,190
You mean I'm stupid.

1104
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,270
No. Of course not.

1105
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,190
I just feel bad about lying to you.

1106
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,830
You still believe it's a black-and-white world.

1107
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,670
I envy you for it.

1108
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,440
Mum,

1109
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,350
do you remember,

1110
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,630
at this place,

1111
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,190
exact the same spot

1112
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:50,790
you told me

1113
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,120
you would only have one kid. Which is me.

1114
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,830
I break my word, I'm sorry.

1115
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,600
But I promise,

1116
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,400
I meant it

1117
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,350
by then.

1118
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
How about now?

1119
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,480
Why did you change your mind?

1120
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,120
Just...

1121
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,630
well, it's a sudden decision.

1122
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,960
I don't want to make

1123
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,000
your father sad anymore.

1124
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,830
What's it to do with dad?

1125
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
I believe

1126
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,600
it's about 15 years ago,

1127
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,150
I was in Beijing,

1128
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,920
in between jobs at the moment.

1129
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,310
Your father

1130
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,040
was about to get his master's degree.

1131
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,560
His professor told him to apply for PhD.

1132
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,440
But I was pregnant.

1133
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,520
You came.

1134
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,920
I decided to go home.

1135
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,920
And, your father, gave up his academic future

1136
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,400
and came back with me.

1137
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,710
He missed a great opportunity.

1138
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,520
I don't want to

1139
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,960
push him to give up anything anymore.

1140
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Dad loves you so much.

1141
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,790
He loves you more.

1142
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,190
He wants to protect

1143
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,630
both of us.

1144
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,520
That's why we are a happy family.

1145
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,120
That's why we have

1146
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,830
a happy life.

1147
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Honestly speaking,

1148
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,600
I don't

1149
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,830
dislike the idea

1150
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,190
to have a sibling.

1151
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,630
I just hate that

1152
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,150
you don't tell me anything.

1153
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,080
You told me nothing

1154
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,230
when dad lost his job

1155
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,270
and you decided

1156
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,150
to sell the car.

1157
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,440
Auntie Lanxiang is new here.

1158
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,190
But you told her about the baby,

1159
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,190
not me.

1160
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,000
Are all adults natural allies?

1161
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,480
I swear that

1162
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,920
we didn't tell Lanxiang

1163
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,670
anything about the baby.

1164
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,350
She somehow figured it out herself.

1165
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,080
She's a mother, after all.

1166
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,560
About the undemocratic situation

1167
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,230
within our family,

1168
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,350
I apologize.

1169
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,270
And I hope you could

1170
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,310
forgive mum and dad.

1171
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,350
We won't let it happen again,

1172
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,000
OK?

1173
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,080
So, the illness

1174
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,400
was also a lie?

1175
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,270
That's not.

1176
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,520
I truly didn't feel well.

1177
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,710
I'm over 40,

1178
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,000
it's normal that I don't feel well

1179
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,520
every now and then.

1180
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,040
Besides, I'm pregnant.

1181
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,120
Well,

1182
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
it's like

1183
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,630
there is a seedling

1184
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,150
growing in my belly.

1185
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,350
What kind of seedling?

1186
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,000
What do you think?

1187
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,600
How about a grape vine?

1188
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,630
I like grape.

1189
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,190
Then grape vine it is.
