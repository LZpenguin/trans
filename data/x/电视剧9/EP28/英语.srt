00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:48,480
Just in Time EP28

3
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,999
Mrs. Jia, we're coming.

4
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm not breastfeeding.

5
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,880
I want to wean.

6
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
I'm in pain. Get lost.

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,479
Hmmm.

8
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,600
You're having a fever...

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,839
No means no.

10
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,960
Jia Haowen.

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,719
Jia Haowen!

12
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:01,960
Coming.

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,359
Go.

14
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:04,639
I'm coming!

15
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:05,479
What's wrong?

16
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Let's find a lactation consultant for her.

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,960
No need.

18
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,279
Get lost.

19
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,079
Alright.

20
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,559
Take the baby out

21
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,520
and have some formula.

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,479
Okay.

23
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,360
Thank you.

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Be careful.

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,039
Honey.

26
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,520
Honey, we have to...

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,759
We have to do something.

28
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,839
You're having a fever.

29
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,279
I want to have a fever.

30
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm going to turn breast milk into yogurt.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,360
Who else wants me to feed the baby?

32
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,680
Honey.

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,080
How dare I think that?

34
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,400
I will feel sorry for you.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,999
Right, honey?

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,640
When I was giving birth to Xiongxiong,

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,599
I didn't have to worry so much.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,480
I said no second child.

39
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,879
My chest and stomach hurt.

40
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,599
I know.

41
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,999
The scar hurts.

42
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:54,640
I know you're hurting.

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,759
My head hurts too.

44
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,439
My heart hurts, honey.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,599
It's uncomfortable.

46
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,559
Alright.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,439
I'll call the nurse.

48
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,879
Honey, I'll call the nurse.

49
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,480
Uncomfortable.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,159
Nurse!

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,360
Nurse!

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,319
This is...

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,120
It's not bad.

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,159
It's a recurring fever.

55
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,039
It doesn't smell bad.

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
Lanxiang, what are you doing here?

57
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,640
I've come to bring Mengxin some food

58
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,080
and some medicine.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,279
Your mom-in-law made it for breastfeeding.

60
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,960
Mom, you're obsessed with breastfeeding.

61
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,520
She doesn't like that word.

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,719
Stop saying that.

63
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,599
She's got a fever.

64
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,879
She's still not breastfeeding.

65
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,120
Little Watermelon was born prematurely,

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,999
is physically weak.

67
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:39,640
If we have her formula

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,200
every day,

69
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,080
She will get inflamed.

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,439
Let me tell you that

71
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,279
Mengxin has a fever

72
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,400
because she doesn't breastfeed.

73
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,080
If she had breastfed,

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
the fever would have gone away.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Really?

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Of course.

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,879
Yes, Mr. Jia.

78
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,039
Li Jing said,

79
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,080
that is...

80
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,039
Pain means discomfort.

81
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,879
Pain...

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Pain...

83
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,319
Pain is discomfort; comfort, no pain.

84
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,039
Right.

85
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,159
Right.

86
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,360
Then I'll try it.

87
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,279
Okay.

88
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,640
Take it to Mengxin and drink it.

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,279
Okay.

90
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,559
What's that strange smell?

91
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,559
Are you sure this will work?

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,439
Yes, it does.

93
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:22,839
Don't move.

94
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,199
Just lie down like this.

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,639
In two hours,

96
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,920
I'll come back to take your temperature.

97
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,879
Thank you.

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,199
Come on, mom.

99
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,800
Honey,

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,959
it's a tonic soup.

101
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,840
It's for my milk again?

102
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,199
Honey,

103
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,120
Not at all. I'm telling you that

104
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,160
my brother-in-law's brother-in-law

105
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,399
is a famous Chinese doctor.

106
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,959
He's given you a prescription.

107
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,720
This soup is

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
carefully made.

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,160
My sister said,

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,280
Pain is discomfort; comfort, no pain.

111
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,360
As long as you feel comfort,

112
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,079
you'll be alright, honey.

113
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,840
Forget about the breastfeed.

114
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,519
Drink it while it's hot,

115
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,519
honey.

116
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,040
Drink it.

117
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,199
Drink it while it's hot.

118
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,199
It smells so fishy!

119
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,360
What's this?

120
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,040
I won't drink it.

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,439
But it's good for you.

122
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,639
It takes a lot to make it.

123
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,959
It's good for you.

124
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,800
Drink it while it's hot.

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,399
It takes a lot to make it.

126
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,319
Honey.

127
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,199
What the hell is this?

128
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,199
Jia Haowen.

129
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,399
Mom.

130
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,639
It's Chinese medicine.

131
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,559
It's very effective.

132
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,360
Drink it.

133
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,600
Chinese medicine. It works.

134
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,920
If you don't tell me,

135
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,920
I won't drink it.

136
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,040
It's very expensive.

137
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,319
It's lumbricus.

138
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:40,720
That's right.

139
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
Honey.

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,759
Lumbricus.

141
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,040
What is lumbricus?

142
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,079
What is lumbricus?

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,879
Earthworm.

144
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,519
Mom.

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,759
Let's get out of here.

146
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,999
Let's go.

147
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,360
What?

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,999
Mom.

149
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,160
You blow me away.

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,920
Just let her drink.

151
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,280
Why did you tell her so much?

152
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,600
Saying lumbricus all that.

153
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,759
It's you asking me.

154
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,319
That's why

155
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,160
I said.

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,319
This is good stuff.

157
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:15,840
Haowen.

158
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,160
Ma'am.

159
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,800
Meng'an.

160
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,199
You're here.

161
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,199
How's Mengxin?

162
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,680
Sister.

163
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,399
I'm just trying to be nice.

164
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,720
I saw that

165
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
she was suffering from a fever.

166
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,759
I asked Li Jing

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,120
to give her this prescription.

168
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,120
You don't have to make it clear to her

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,280
that this was made with earthworms.

170
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,439
It's normal

171
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,280
to find some insects

172
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,399
in traditional Chinese medicine,

173
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,800
like centipedes,

174
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,480
scorpions,

175
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,319
or earthworms.

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:38,759
Don't worry,

177
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,280
Ma'am.

178
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,439
Just leave it all

179
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,639
to me.

180
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,639
She has been working hard.

181
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,840
Why don't you take her home to rest?

182
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,439
And you should go and freshen up as well.

183
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,920
I've

184
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,879
got this covered.

185
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,639
Don't worry.

186
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,079
Sister,

187
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,199
I feel assured with you here.

188
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,519
What about this?

189
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,319
I will

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,040
take care

191
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,160
of everything.

192
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Thank you so much for coming.

193
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,480
No problem.

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,079
Don't be upset.

195
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,240
They're all gone now.

196
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,399
All gone?

197
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Including Jia Haowen?

198
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,319
Bring him back.

199
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,840
I was the one who told him to leave.

200
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,199
Just let him go home

201
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,399
and freshen up.

202
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,079
Am I right?

203
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,199
Won't you feel better

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,280
seeing a clean and handsome husband

205
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,559
by your side?

206
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,519
He's been taking care

207
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,840
of you non-stop for days.

208
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,040
He needs a break too.

209
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,759
Is it his child?

210
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,959
Why should he have it easy

211
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,319
while I suffer through childbirth?

212
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,319
Isn't it your child

213
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,040
too?

214
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,480
And Haowen still needs to help raise it.

215
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Raising a child isn't

216
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
as hard as giving birth.

217
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,120
I went through so much pain

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,199
to have this baby.

219
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,280
And now he just gets

220
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,920
to be a dad like that?

221
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,439
No way.

222
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,079
Do you know

223
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,439
what his family did

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,879
to make me

225
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,280
produce more milk?

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,759
They forced me to drink earthworm soup!

227
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,759
Earthworms,

228
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,040
alive

229
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,439
and with dirt on them.

230
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,399
Disgusting.

231
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,840
You see it?

232
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
No.

233
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,199
That's right.

234
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,600
Rumors start like this.

235
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,199
This recipe was

236
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,079
probably prescribed

237
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,319
by my brother-in-law.

238
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,519
If there were earthworms,

239
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,759
they would have been dried ones.

240
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,879
But dried earthworms

241
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,360
are still earthworms.

242
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,879
I've had this medicine

243
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,279
before too.

244
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,320
What?

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
How could you drink it?

246
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,360
When I had engorged breasts,

247
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
it hurt so much.

248
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm telling you

249
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,080
At that time,

250
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,799
I was willing to do anything

251
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,919
just to stop the pain,

252
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,399
even drink Chinese medicine.

253
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,560
And you know

254
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,840
what happened?

255
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,600
No more engorgement,

256
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,639
no mastitis,

257
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,720
nothing.

258
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,159
No symptoms at all,

259
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,919
you see?

260
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
That amazing, huh?

261
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
You bet.

262
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
Want to try it?

263
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
No way.

264
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,039
I'd rather let it swell.

265
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:24,840
They're just trying

266
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
to turn me into a milk cow,

267
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,080
feeding the baby my milk.

268
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm not doing it.

269
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,519
That' right.

270
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,039
No need to breastfeed.

271
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,759
We won't do that.

272
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,919
Why would we need to?

273
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,120
That's what all those

274
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,999
formula milk companies

275
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
are for.

276
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,480
Am I right?

277
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,879
But the key is,

278
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,919
do you want to feel better now?

279
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,600
It hurts.

280
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,600
Oh,

281
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,679
this is just

282
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,159
the beginning.

283
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,039
There's more pain to come?

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
Some people even need surgery.

285
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,279
Really? On the chest?

286
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,240
Yeah,

287
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,279
if it gets infected

288
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,639
and the tissue gets damaged,

289
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
it has

290
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,840
to be cut.

291
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,999
I don't want surgery.

292
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,440
We won't let it come to that.

293
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,279
We have so many things to do.

294
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,639
Just drink the medicine

295
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,240
and it might help.

296
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,759
Will it work after just one dose?

297
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,080
One dose should

298
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
give some relief,

299
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,039
and you'll see full effects in seven days.

300
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:36,639
Drink it up.

301
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,039
It tastes awful.

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes.

303
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,639
I know.

304
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,600
But this is

305
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,759
for your comfort.

306
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Pinch your nose, close your eyes,

307
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,279
and chug it down

308
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,120
in one go.

309
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,120
One go...

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,200
One go...

311
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,720
Alright,

312
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,720
one, two, three, drink!

313
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,759
I've never seen

314
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,960
such a brave sister!

315
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,679
I'm suffering so much

316
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,320
during this postpartum period.

317
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,480
Don't cry, my dear.

318
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm here.

319
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,080
They haven't let you

320
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
shower or wash your hair in days, right?

321
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,799
Yes.

322
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,320
The wound can't get wet,

323
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,600
or it might get infected.

324
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,240
But do you want to wash your hair?

325
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,519
Can I?

326
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,960
Just tell me if you want to.

327
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,679
I do.

328
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,039
Then let's do it.

329
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,759
I'll finish the

330
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,279
client memo tonight

331
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
and send it to you once it's done.

332
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,560
You're back on your game so quickly,

333
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,039
like the old days

334
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,840
when you used

335
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,320
to crush me at work.

336
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,240
It's all thanks

337
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,480
to your wise leadership.

338
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,840
Without your guidance,

339
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,679
I wouldn't be back

340
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,960
to work so soon.

341
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,440
If you hadn't taken

342
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,679
maternity leave back then,

343
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,279
you'd be my boss right now,

344
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,399
and I'd be here

345
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,360
typing reports to you.

346
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
Stop flattering me.

347
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,519
Just go easy on me

348
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,120
in the investment strategy meetings.

349
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,240
I only criticize the work, not the person.

350
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,560
Don't take it to heart.

351
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Oh, at this time,

352
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,080
the kids should be getting out of school.

353
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,200
Don't let me stop you from picking them up.

354
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,999
No worries, we have a nanny at home.

355
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,360
A nanny isn't the same as a mom, is it?

356
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,399
That doesn't

357
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,159
sound like you.

358
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
What should I

359
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
be saying then?

360
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,039
"Chen Wanzhen,

361
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,440
forget about the kids

362
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,600
and go earn money for me!"

363
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,480
You really think I'm Zhou Leech.

364
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,360
Alright.

365
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,279
How do you feel?

366
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,519
Good.

367
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,120
Good, isn't it?

368
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,440
The old saying is right,

369
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,720
but they didn't have hair dryers

370
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,799
back then,

371
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,560
so letting your hair dry naturally

372
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,679
could lead to

373
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,519
dampness entering the body.

374
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
But now, even though you've washed it,

375
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
you shouldn't do it too often.

376
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,600
Alright?

377
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,919
Feel good after washing my hair.

378
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,360
If you feel good,

379
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,799
everyone feels good.

380
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,720
Why didn't you

381
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,999
come sooner?

382
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,320
If you had,

383
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,840
I'd have

384
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,480
felt better

385
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,679
much earlier.

386
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,519
That's not fair.

387
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,440
You didn't want to see me.

388
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:05,759
Who made

389
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,759
my husband

390
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,519
sign the surgery consent form,

391
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,879
causing me to have a Caesarean

392
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,600
when I wanted a natural birth?

393
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,720
Naturally born children are smarter.

394
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,879
You didn't even want the baby,

395
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,279
so why care if she is smart or not?

396
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,039
Why don't you just say

397
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,480
you want to have a baby?

398
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,120
Don't be so stubborn.

399
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,720
You're a grown woman now,

400
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,200
and if you don't want this baby,

401
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
you can handle her

402
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,080
yourself.

403
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Let me see.

404
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,919
Little Grape.

405
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,200
Little Grape.

406
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,279
I'm your auntie.

407
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,240
You know the baby's name is Little Grape?

408
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,639
Yunjie told me.

409
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,799
Yunjie named the baby Little Grape,

410
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,919
Xiongxiong named her Little Watermelon.

411
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,960
A whole family of fruits,

412
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,919
isn't it fun?

413
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,200
So sweet.

414
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,480
It's been three months, right?

415
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,240
Little Grape is now like a Little Plum.

416
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,919
We can't call it Little Plum.

417
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,080
Right,

418
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,360
Little Grape sounds better.

419
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,720
Come on, I'll help you back to bed.

420
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,480
Hold the wound, take it slow.

421
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:06,840
Here you go.

422
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,600
Okay.

423
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,399
Wanwan, Zhenzhen.

424
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,560
Mr. Yu.

425
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,279
Play with us.

426
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,840
Yeah.

427
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,720
I'll just grab my package quickly

428
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,080
and be right back.

429
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,600
Okay.

430
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,279
Wait for me.

431
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:25,879
Alright.

432
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:49,360
Mr. Zhou,

433
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,320
thanks for sending me back.

434
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,879
Wanzhen.

435
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:52,799
What's wrong?

436
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:53,999
I just received this.

437
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,720
It's Mr. Qian's letter of apology.

438
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,720
You won't be troubled

439
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,879
by him anymore.

440
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,399
Thank you, boss.

441
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,840
Don't mention it.

442
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,399
I'm not doing this for you.

443
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,399
I just don't want this issue

444
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,320
to affect your ability

445
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,999
to make money for me.

446
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,799
I know,

447
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,639
but

448
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,799
I still appreciate it.

449
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,200
Sir, your package.

450
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,639
Okay.

451
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:30,560
Alright.

452
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,399
Thanks.

453
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,600
What's this?

454
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:36,039
Don't get me wrong.

455
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,360
It's a gift to celebrate your promotion.

456
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,919
I know you probably don't have time

457
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,039
for a celebration dinner with me.

458
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,759
Wanzhen,

459
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,279
congratulations on your promotion.

460
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:46,399
Thanks.

461
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:46,879
I know

462
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,159
your abilities go beyond this.

463
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,720
Keep going!

464
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,919
I'm so touched.

465
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,159
Keep it up.

466
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,560
Keep making money for you.

467
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,519
That's what I like to hear.

468
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,960
Keep going and make money for me!

469
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,840
You still have something for me?

470
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,039
What's this?

471
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,239
Dr. Yu.

472
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:17,840
Ms. Chen.

473
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,639
What a coincidence!

474
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:19,360
Yes, I…

475
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
I was just downstairs getting a package.

476
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,080
The flowers are pretty.

477
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:29,679
Mom.

478
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,159
Mom.

479
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,159
Wanwan, Zhenzhen,

480
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,679
slow down.

481
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,120
Dear,

482
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,360
be careful.

483
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,800
Mom, what's this?

484
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,040
Flowers and gifts?

485
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
These are Mommy's prizes

486
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,399
for promotion.

487
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,840
Want them?

488
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,679
Sure!

489
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,320
Here you go.

490
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,679
Thank you.

491
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,399
Thank you, Mommy!

492
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,040
Sister,

493
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,560
do I look ugly now?

494
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,600
I didn't give you a plastic surgery.

495
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,280
You look great!

496
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,120
Look, your skin is so good now,

497
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,600
no pores,

498
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,959
no wrinkles.

499
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,000
Do you know why?

500
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,639
Estrogen.

501
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:13,879
You're beautiful.

502
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
You're just saying that to comfort me.

503
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,239
Well, I'm happy to do that.

504
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:22,560
How do you feel

505
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,719
after having

506
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,959
your second child?

507
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,280
Looking for some tips?

508
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,120
Aren't I just following in your footsteps?

509
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,840
Is there ever a time

510
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,520
when you're behind me?

511
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,520
So happy!

512
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,159
So happy!

513
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:38,840
You feel incredibly satisfied,

514
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,879
don't you?

515
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,399
Immensely.

516
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,159
Alright,

517
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,000
go on.

518
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
Got another scar.

519
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,719
Can't get over it, can you?

520
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,919
How about this:

521
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,600
I'll have a Caesarean too.

522
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:56,399
Fine,

523
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:57,919
I'll make my brother-in-law

524
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
sign the consent form.

525
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,719
No need.

526
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,600
You just sign it.

527
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,520
Revenge needs

528
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:02,679
to be ruthless.

529
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:03,520
Got it.

530
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:04,959
Can we move on now?

531
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:09,679
Sister,

532
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:11,959
do you think

533
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,879
I won't be able to do anything from now on?

534
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,919
What do you mean?

535
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:17,360
Ever since I had Xiongxiong,

536
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I haven't worked a day

537
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,360
in years,

538
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,919
and now with Little Watermelon,

539
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,399
I feel like I'll never

540
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,959
be able to do

541
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,199
what I want again.

542
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,399
What do you want to do?

543
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,280
I'm not sure,

544
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,479
but I feel

545
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,639
less like myself every day.

546
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,919
I think you don't have

547
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,560
to worry about it.

548
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,360
Plenty of white-collar

549
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,280
workers

550
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,439
have two or three kids,

551
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,280
and they're still

552
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,760
doing their own things.

553
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,280
Nothing stops them, right?

554
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,520
Still watching movies with their husbands,

555
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,280
having late-night snacks with colleagues.

556
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,719
As long as you plan

557
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,040
your time and life well,

558
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:04,239
you can do whatever you want.

559
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:06,120
Just think about Wanzhen.

560
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
She had two kids from the start.

561
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Did it delay anything for her?

562
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,879
Exactly,

563
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:11,280
then she got divorced.

564
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:15,199
I think it was

565
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,800
because Yu Hai was unreliable.

566
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,560
Who's more dependable

567
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,560
than Jia Haowen?

568
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,679
Honestly,

569
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,919
sometimes I feel like

570
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:23,600
even Li Lin is not as good

571
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,840
as Jia Haowen.

572
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,040
Are you jealous of me?

573
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,600
Yeah.

574
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,040
Mixed with a bit of envy.

575
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,120
Just relax

576
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,600
and take care of yourself.

577
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,520
You're just going

578
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,080
through a special period right now.

579
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,199
It's natural to be a bit sensitive.

580
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
But don't worry.

581
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,399
I'm here to get through it with you.

582
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,120
When you decide what you want to do,

583
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,879
just let me know.

584
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:52,719
Okay?

585
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,840
I'll help you arrange it.

586
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
Can't trust my abilities?

587
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,439
Right?

588
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:58,000
Here you go again,

589
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,639
trying to comfort me.

590
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,280
Sis,

591
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,239
I know.

592
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:10,280
You've been trying to cheer me up.

593
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,360
If I were an actress,

594
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,919
you wouldn't even notice, would you?

595
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,760
No chance.

596
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,639
But I like it.

597
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,479
I'm happy to let you comfort me.

598
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:25,879
It makes me happy.

599
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:27,479
Then I'll keep doing it,

600
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,679
comforting you for the rest of your life,

601
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,320
okay?

602
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
You said it!

603
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:35,399
When have I ever kept my word?

604
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,120
Here, have some apple.

605
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:42,199
You cut it so big!

606
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,280
My mouth is too small to eat that.

607
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,919
Then I'll chop it into a puree for you.

608
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,560
Haowen just cuts a little piece.

609
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Now you realize how good your husband is.

610
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,159
Don't act up anymore, okay?

611
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,399
I'm really getting more impressed

612
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,679
with Jia Haowen.

613
00:21:58,679 --> 00:21:59,560
I really mean that.

614
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,399
Alright.

615
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,840
Is it okay?

616
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,800
Yeah.

617
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,919
So sweet.

618
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,239
Some women are princesses before marriage

619
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,679
and after marriage, they're just discarded.

620
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,639
But you're still a princess

621
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:16,840
even after getting married,

622
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,159
you're never satisfied, always acting up.

623
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,399
Don't do that anymore, okay?

624
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,560
Just pamper me in the future, okay?

625
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,959
Yunjie,

626
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,959
I'm going to pick up your mom.

627
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,959
You have dinner with your aunt tonight.

628
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,919
Don't wait for us.

629
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:50,879
Yunjie,

630
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I'm talking to you.

631
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,000
What are you looking at?

632
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,439
It's washed.

633
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,239
This pair of jeans is finally washed.

634
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,560
Great!

635
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,560
What do you know?

636
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,760
I was nurturing them for three months

637
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,159
to get the shape just right.

638
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,679
Aunt washed them all.

639
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,840
Aunt didn't know

640
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,879
you were taking care of your jeans,

641
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:20,840
right?

642
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,840
Where did you leave them?

643
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,239
On the balcony in my room.

644
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:25,719
Yeah,

645
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,000
worn jeans just

646
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,560
tossed on the balcony.

647
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,000
Who wouldn't want to wash them?

648
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,639
Didn't dad wash them

649
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:33,600
once before?

650
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,760
Now, this is the second time.

651
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,360
Well,

652
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,360
maybe the third time

653
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,479
will turn out even better.

654
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,239
Alright.

655
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:41,159
Never mind.

656
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,120
Turn

657
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,040
around

658
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,760
and go do your homework.

659
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,199
Where are you going?

660
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,040
To pick up Meng'an.

661
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,280
She's at the postpartum center

662
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,479
with Mengxin.

663
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,879
I was going to tell you,

664
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,479
Meng'an has been pregnant

665
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,959
for several months now.

666
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:58,959
She's 40, it's not easy

667
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,760
to be pregnant.

668
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:01,840
She almost had

669
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:02,639
a miscarriage before,

670
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,239
remember?

671
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,879
Don't let her run around too much.

672
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,439
She needs more rest.

673
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,360
Got it, sis.

674
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,040
Now,

675
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,360
Mengxin is a bit down

676
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,080
after giving birth,

677
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:16,399
and Meng'an is the only one

678
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,479
who can comfort her.

679
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,639
She only listens to her sister

680
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,040
and loves to talk to her.

681
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,600
How come she always listens

682
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,560
to her sister,

683
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,080
but you don't listen to yours?

684
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,080
Have I not listened to you?

685
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,320
How else can I listen to you?

686
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
I listen to you for everything.

687
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,959
If you had listened to me earlier,

688
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,120
your second child would've grown up.

689
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:39,760
Yeah.

690
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,479
Third and fourth ones would follow.

691
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:43,840
So happy.

692
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:50,679
Sis,

693
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,639
if we have clothes to be washed,

694
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,120
they should be in the laundry basket.

695
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,280
If they're scattered

696
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,360
elsewhere,

697
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,239
there must be a reason.

698
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,280
What do you mean?

699
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,000
Did you wash

700
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,560
Yunjie's jeans?

701
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,120
They were too dirty,

702
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:16,040
and the water turned black.

703
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:16,879
Yeah.

704
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,919
The black water is

705
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,320
what she was nurturing.

706
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,600
It's her pride and joy.

707
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,919
You washed it.

708
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:23,959
and she's heartbroken.

709
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,479
What?

710
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,840
She was nurturing them?

711
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,760
Yeah,

712
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,239
it's part

713
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,239
of her

714
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,679
aesthetic pursuit.

715
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,560
It's fine.

716
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
I'll explain

717
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,040
to Yunjie.

718
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,919
Never mind. I've already talked to her.

719
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,439
I'll just tell her

720
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,639
to put any clothes

721
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,679
that need washing

722
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:45,199
in the laundry basket,

723
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,959
not scattered around.

724
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,439
You carry on with your work.

725
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,360
Why would she

726
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,000
nurture jeans?

727
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I've heard of flowers,

728
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,600
but jeans?

729
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,120
Never heard

730
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,320
of that.

731
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,080
You've reconciled with Mengxin.

732
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:20,280
That's one worry less.

733
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:21,439
That's good.

734
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,120
How's work?

735
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,399
Getting along with the new deputy director?

736
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,560
Is he good at his job?

737
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,199
Yeah.

738
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,199
You know who it is?

739
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,120
Who?

740
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,479
Huang Sisi.

741
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,399
Huang...

742
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,520
Huang Sisi?

743
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,760
She's with Yu Hai...

744
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:41,600
What a coincidence.

745
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,239
Such a small circle.

746
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:47,280
Mr. Zhang.

747
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,520
Meng'an,

748
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,800
take a look

749
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,040
at the short video

750
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,000
Huang Sisi posted.

751
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:52,719
What happened?

752
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:53,439
Something wrong?

753
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,679
No.

754
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,360
It's gone viral!

755
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,479
Did you see it?

756
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,919
I was watching it all along.

757
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,919
In just a few hours,

758
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,479
it's gotten over 100,000 views.

759
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,000
Huang Sisi is really good.

760
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,719
I'll tell you that.

761
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,360
A new broom sweeps clean,

762
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,919
bringing us a lot

763
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:09,639
of new users.

764
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,360
Yeah.

765
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,239
That's something to celebrate!

766
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,280
Congratulations, Mr. Zhang!

767
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay.

768
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,399
Bye.

769
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:27,239
He sent a red packet in the group chat.

770
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,040
Feeling a bit uncomfortable about it?

771
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,879
Not really,

772
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:36,800
but I'm definitely

773
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,840
not quite happy with it.

774
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,439
So, should I take this red packet or not?

775
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,280
Take it.

776
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,320
You absolutely must take it.

777
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,159
And not just take it,

778
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,280
you should be the first to do so.

779
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,399
Don't miss a single one.

780
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,399
Why?

781
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,080
Because you're the boss.

782
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:54,959
When new colleagues achieve something,

783
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,120
you need to lead

784
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,760
by showing support.

785
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,120
It makes you seem generous

786
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,239
and approachable.

787
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,439
You're so smart.

788
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,320
That's exactly

789
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,479
why I like you.

790
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,479
Didn't you say

791
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,679
it was my face you liked?

792
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah,

793
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,000
because whenever I see your face,

794
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,800
I just can't stay mad.

795
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:21,879
What's that supposed to mean?

796
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,040
So cheesy?

797
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,360
It's kind of exciting.

798
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:54,000
Sis, we're back!

799
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:55,760
Do you know what time it is?

800
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,879
You're a high-risk pregnant woman

801
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,199
coming home so late every day.

802
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,399
Do you think that's appropriate?

803
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,719
And you,

804
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,439
picking her up

805
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,719
takes so much time.

806
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,439
What kind of husband are you?

807
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,080
It's my fault.

808
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:10,840
It's my fault.

809
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,760
I know

810
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,080
it's out of line.

811
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,040
Sis.

812
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,199
Sis,

813
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,040
it's a good thing you're here at home,

814
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,000
otherwise,

815
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,679
we wouldn't know

816
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,679
what to do.

817
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,600
Thank you so much, sis!

818
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,199
Alright.

819
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:26,639
Good girl.

820
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,600
Alright.

821
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,719
Be good

822
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,560
next time.

823
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,959
From now on,

824
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,040
Be home before 7 PM.

825
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,639
Got it.

826
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:41,439
Now, let's check your blood pressure.

827
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,959
Check it.

828
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,040
Check it.

829
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,679
Check it right away.

830
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,360
Sis, you have no idea that

831
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,560
registering is such a hassle.

832
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
They want us to go to the community clinic,

833
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,520
then the street office.

834
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:54,879
Yeah.

835
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,479
Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

836
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,399
Don't worry.

837
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,159
I'll handle it.

838
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,719
I'll go.

839
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,040
Give me the materials.

840
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll take care of it.

841
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,800
You?

842
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,879
Will you even know the way?

843
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:04,919
Can you do it?

844
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,080
Don't you know me by now?

845
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,760
On this planet,

846
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,280
just give me an address,

847
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,919
and there's nowhere I can't find!

848
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:13,919
Besides,

849
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,879
our family runs a clinic

850
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:16,719
and I know

851
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,760
the procedures.

852
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,840
Alright,

853
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,080
we'll leave it to you.

854
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,080
Your blood sugar

855
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,320
is a bit high,

856
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,280
and your cholesterol too.

857
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:30,360
From tomorrow,

858
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,120
let's control your diet.

859
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,360
Pack lunch.

860
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:52,360
Hmmm.

861
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,040
Sis,

862
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,159
you're pretty good

863
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:57,320
at checking blood pressure

864
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,239
even after retiring

865
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,399
from the medical field.

866
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,639
Sis.

867
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,560
It's a bit high.

868
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,199
Should we check it again?

869
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,439
I'll calm down a bit.

870
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,479
Alright,

871
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:33,959
calm

872
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,439
your mind,

873
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,399
and don't think about unpleasant things.

874
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,120
Let's try again.

875
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:40,199
Hey,

876
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,679
it's almost 10 PM.

877
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,040
No talking.

878
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,560
Let's check it again.

879
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,199
You're enjoying this, huh?

880
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,040
Blood pressure is serious business.

881
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
What do you know?

882
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Sis, It's enough.

883
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:55,600
It's too tight,

884
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,959
Can't take it anymore.

885
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,560
Have

886
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,320
you released the air or not?

887
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,000
It's still a bit high.

888
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,479
Pack lunch.

889
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,120
Pack lunch.

890
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,439
Thank you, Dr. Li.

891
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,040
So kind of you.

892
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:26,040
Even take care of the meal.

893
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:36,679
Sis.

894
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,760
Why aren't you asleep yet?

895
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,840
I suddenly thought of something.

896
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,520
What is it?

897
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,959
I wanted to ask

898
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,560
about the effectiveness

899
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:46,919
of that medicine.

900
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Let me tell you,

901
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,760
with Chinese medicine,

902
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,679
it's all about regulation.

903
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,439
It takes time.

904
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,120
Today,

905
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,479
when I coaxed Mengxin to take the medicine,

906
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,840
I told her it would relieve symptoms

907
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,879
in one dose

908
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,959
and be effective in seven days.

909
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:07,399
Seven days?

910
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,520
She already thinks that's too slow.

911
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:10,479
Then…

912
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,320
Let me call

913
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,159
your brother-in-law.

914
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,080
Coming.

915
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,320
I will handle it.

916
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:36,840
Mom.

917
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,239
Yeah.

918
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,000
She's asleep.

919
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,959
Alright.

920
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,439
Don't worry.

921
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,000
Take care.

922
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:42,879
Honey,

923
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,879
we're home!

924
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,439
It's been a while and you must miss home.

925
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,439
Let's go.

926
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,360
Why are we here?

927
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,439
Aren't we going to your parents' house?

928
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,560
Dad is still recovering,

929
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,000
Mom's struggling alone.

930
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,879
Honey,

931
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:54,760
come on.

932
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:55,639
Let me help you.

933
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,080
We're home!

934
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,199
Let's go.

935
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:58,719
Honey.

936
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,520
Let's go.

937
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:01,760
I'll help.

938
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,959
We're home.

939
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,719
Madam is back.

940
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,840
I'll help.

941
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,679
Let me help. You go get the luggage.

942
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,199
Let's go.

943
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,239
I'll help you.

944
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,199
What's in Mengxin's suitcase?

945
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:24,480
Why is it so heavy?

946
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,639
Lacking exercise?

947
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,920
Mrs. Jia's postpartum recovery

948
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,040
is almost two months now.

949
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,520
You've been lounging at home all day

950
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,839
and still getting paid,

951
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,719
time to do some work.

952
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:34,239
Help me,

953
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,120
help me hold this for a moment.

954
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:37,920
Where's my cooler box?

955
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,560
Madam.

956
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,040
It's here.

957
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,880
Here.

958
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:42,279
This is my granddaughter's food.

959
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,279
I need to get it in the fridge quickly.

960
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,920
Baby,

961
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,000
such a good girl.

962
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,639
So pretty.

963
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,480
Drink mommy's milk.

964
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,880
White and beautiful.

965
00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:59,839
The whole family is

966
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,880
trying to get me to lactate.

967
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,920
So annoying.

968
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:06,920
So beautiful.

969
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,080
Where's my luggage?

970
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:09,679
Luggage?

971
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
Oops, quiet down.

972
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,639
I'll get it.

973
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:22,040
Don't move.

974
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:23,359
Don't move.

975
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,199
Move aside, I've got it.

976
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,799
Almost feeding time.

977
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,359
Pack it up nicely.

978
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,359
Be quiet.

979
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,920
Avoid her hysterical screams.

980
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,920
What's up?

981
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:47,199
Is your wife recovered, Mr. Jia?

982
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,639
I just got home.

983
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:50,799
Well, Mr. Jia,

984
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:52,400
can you come to the office now?

985
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,040
Why would I come?

986
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,880
I haven't even unpacked yet.

987
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,359
The chairman is here today.

988
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,600
You'd better come over,

989
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,319
or you'll be in trouble.

990
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,159
If he's here, he's here.

991
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,159
She doesn't know how to care for the baby.

992
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:03,759
I still have

993
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,920
to go pick up my eldest child.

994
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,960
You should still come over.

995
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,400
Work is important.

996
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,799
Fine.

997
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:11,960
You are so annoying!

998
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,560
You're driving me crazy!

999
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,400
Jia Haowen, does he think

1000
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,040
he's the one having the baby?

1001
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,920
Mr. Zheng,

1002
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,880
Mr. Jia is on his way.

1003
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,719
He's always absent when I'm in the office.

1004
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,159
My attendance is higher than his.

1005
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,960
At this rate,

1006
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:36,759
does he still want

1007
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:37,679
to keep his job as general manager?

1008
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:40,639
Hurry

1009
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,679
and sort out

1010
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,600
her little clothes and towels.

1011
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:43,839
Don't let her

1012
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,799
start screaming at me again.

1013
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,359
I'm heading out for a bit.

1014
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,040
I'll be back soon.

1015
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,480
Where are you going?

1016
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,440
Something came up at work.

1017
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,480
I'll be back soon.

1018
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,960
If you leave,

1019
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,080
How do I handle the baby alone?

1020
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,799
Jia Haowen!

1021
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,839
Honey,

1022
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,080
I'll be right back!

1023
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,159
Sweetheart.

1024
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,920
Don't come back!

1025
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,199
What are you staring at?

1026
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,600
Move these things downstairs.

1027
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,799
Morning, everyone.

1028
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,239
Good morning, Ms. Xu.

1029
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,759
Get ready,

1030
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,279
something big is happening today!

1031
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:38,520
What?

1032
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,839
The project Huang Sisi brought in

1033
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:41,679
has been going full speed for two months,

1034
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,000
and it's wrapping up today.

1035
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,000
I even saw her

1036
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,400
bringing cake to celebrate.

1037
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
So, should I eat the cake or not?

1038
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:51,679
Of course, you should eat it.

1039
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,199
Don't let your spirit waver.

1040
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,880
Besides,

1041
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:56,560
you're her superior.

1042
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:57,480
If you don't eat,

1043
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,159
people might think

1044
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,319
you have an issue with her.

1045
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,279
Why does it feel worse

1046
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,080
than swallowing a fly?

1047
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,080
Swallowing flies is part of the workplace.

1048
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,600
Not big a deal.

1049
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,319
You need

1050
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:11,679
to put on a strong face, okay?

1051
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,679
Everyone, pause for a moment.

1052
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:13,719
Treat

1053
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,520
the Content Department.

1054
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,080
Have some cake.

1055
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,520
Here comes the fly.

1056
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,679
Coffee and milk tea

1057
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,600
will be here soon.

1058
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,440
Let's celebrate the success

1059
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
of my first project at Xinmiao Media.

1060
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,199
Come on.

1061
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,000
Thank you, Ms. Huang.

1062
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:23,679
Thanks.

1063
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,400
Forks!

1064
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,920
Look

1065
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,520
at all your subordinates.

1066
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:28,040
Who isn't swallowing flies here?

1067
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Swallow them gracefully.

1068
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,279
It's only been a short time,

1069
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,199
and already a big hit.

1070
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:32,719
Congratulations.

1071
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,199
Share the joy.

1072
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:34,960
Thanks.

1073
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:37,960
Let's go.

1074
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,480
Who else hasn't gotten any yet?

1075
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,560
Two directors, have some cake.

1076
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,560
Ms. Xu,

1077
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,080
your Content Department

1078
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,120
is really good!

1079
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:50,040
Our Content Department

1080
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,279
doesn't have a single softie,

1081
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:51,799
right?

1082
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,319
Ms. Huang.

1083
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,520
Congratulations!

1084
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,080
Thank you, Ms. Xu, for the recognition.

1085
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
I'll keep working hard.

1086
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:58,920
Great!

1087
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,639
Have some cake.

1088
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:05,639
Alright.

1089
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,199
Thanks.

1090
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
After you finish the cake,

1091
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,639
let's have a meeting

1092
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,400
to review

1093
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,679
the previous successes

1094
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,880
and plan

1095
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,960
for the future.

1096
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,600
Ms. Huang,

1097
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,560
this is your grand entrance

1098
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
at Xinmiao Media.

1099
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
We have to hold on

1100
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,799
to this victory.

1101
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,480
By the way,

1102
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,560
I need to talk to you

1103
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,839
about my future work plans.

1104
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,440
Alright.

1105
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,799
You all carry on!

1106
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,400
It's delicious.

1107
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,239
So sweet.

1108
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,759
Where did you get it?

1109
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,159
If you want more, just let me know,

1110
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:34,679
I'll get plenty.

1111
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,560
No.

1112
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,679
It's not the same when you buy it

1113
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,839
versus when I buy it myself.

1114
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,159
Madam,

1115
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,040
what's this thing for?

1116
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,839
It's a breast pump.

1117
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:53,159
Didn't I ask you

1118
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,359
to learn about childcare?

1119
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,319
You don't even know this?

1120
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:56,239
How will you take care of the baby?

1121
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,560
I've talked to Ms. Li Jing

1122
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,759
what to prepare.

1123
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,719
I know how to raise a child.

1124
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,520
I brought up

1125
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,719
my kids by myself.

1126
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,600
Madam,

1127
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,719
I've prepared the diapers,

1128
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,159
wet wipes, dry tissues,

1129
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:14,120
soft wipes, disinfectant,

1130
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,600
and I've sewn a quilt for the baby.

1131
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,719
Also, there's the bed guard.

1132
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:21,000
Madam,

1133
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
all these high-tech things…

1134
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,679
I've never seen them before.

1135
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
Back then when I had kids,

1136
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,239
we didn't have all these nice things.

1137
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,239
Ying,

1138
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,759
for everything the baby needs,

1139
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:32,839
just buy another set

1140
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:33,639
according to what I've prepared,

1141
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,279
alright?

1142
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,400
The brand is different.

1143
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:38,960
Oh, by the way,

1144
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,400
have you bought the sterilizer yet?

1145
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,080
No, I haven't bought the sterilizer,

1146
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,239
but I did get

1147
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,960
disinfectant and disinfectant wipes.

1148
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,600
No, that won't do.

1149
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,080
You have to use a proper sterilizer.

1150
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,279
Chemical substances can

1151
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,080
irritate the baby's skin.

1152
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,880
Then I'll buy one.

1153
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:55,880
Oh, madam,

1154
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,799
I have rhinitis.

1155
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:57,600
It's not contagious.

1156
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
Alright,

1157
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,279
I'll buy the sterilizer myself.

1158
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,120
Disinfect all

1159
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,839
these bottles and jars again,

1160
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:05,839
okay?

1161
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,040
Little Watermelon,

1162
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:19,000
such a sweet baby.

1163
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,639
You are so beautiful!

1164
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,520
Look at those big eyes,

1165
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,159
they're so lovely.

1166
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,639
Such a

1167
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,759
good baby,

1168
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,719
Grandma loves you so much.

1169
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,040
Mom.

1170
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,799
That's great.

1171
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,319
Mom.

1172
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:38,719
Baby.

1173
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:39,839
What's up?

1174
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:41,920
Ying isn't suitable.

1175
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,279
We need to find an infants' nurse.

1176
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,279
There's no need.

1177
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:46,159
Aren't I here?

1178
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,239
I'm specifically here

1179
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,719
to help you take care of the baby.

1180
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,679
Right, Little Watermelon?

1181
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,440
You can just lend a hand.

1182
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,880
If I make you tired,

1183
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,759
the responsibility would be too much.

1184
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,520
Nannies are quite expensive, you know.

1185
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,719
And with two nannies

1186
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,960
at home,

1187
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
isn't that too extravagant?

1188
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:06,560
Isn't it?

1189
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:07,639
Alright,

1190
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,400
then we won't hire one.

1191
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,679
That's more like it.

1192
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,560
She's my granddaughter.

1193
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,520
Leaving her with anyone, I'd be uneasy.

1194
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,920
Let Mr. Jia come back

1195
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,359
and take care of his own daughter.

1196
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,400
No more working.

1197
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,520
Then…

1198
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:25,639
Find someone immediately.

1199
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:27,359
find someone immediately.

1200
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,239
Little Watermelon,

1201
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,040
your mom wants

1202
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,600
to find another nanny to take care of you

1203
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,080
together with grandma,

1204
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,159
how does that sound?

1205
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:40,719
Look at Little Watermelon,

1206
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,799
drinking mommy's milk

1207
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:43,319
is really different.

1208
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,880
Those rosy cheeks.

1209
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,159
Breastfeeding is just so good,

1210
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,319
right?

1211
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,440
Our precious little one

1212
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,279
is growing up so healthy

1213
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,080
and strong.

1214
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,880
Such a good baby.

1215
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,359
Grandma loves you so much.
