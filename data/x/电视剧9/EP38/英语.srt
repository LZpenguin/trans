1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,940
Just in Time EP38

3
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,359
I'm doing well.

4
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:53,760
There's no need for concern,

5
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,800
okay?

6
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:59,040
Well,

7
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,199
I should hang up.

8
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:02,400
Goodbye.

9
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,559
Let's wrap up the call.

10
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,359
You're working overtime, aren't you?

11
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:11,160
Bye.

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,839
Did you update Meng'an

13
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,879
on the progress of your work again?

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,999
I am still worried.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
By the way, I need to talk to you.

16
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,759
What's up?

17
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,719
Ask for leave.

18
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,680
You asked it before. It's approved.

19
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,080
I mean,

20
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,240
currently,

21
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
the project is

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,879
really picking up speed,

23
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,520
and everything is going smoothly.

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,920
I am thinking of

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,319
taking time off

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:45,999
to go back home

27
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,480
every weekend.

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,559
Is that too much?

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,200
But

30
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,360
I have no choice.

31
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,400
Meng'an is about to

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,559
go into labor.

33
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,319
The baby is full-term

34
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,719
and could arrive at any moment.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,920
I want to be there for them

36
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,599
as much as possible

37
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,920
to feel more secure,

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,480
you know?

39
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,039
Lin,

40
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,159
are you secretly

41
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,599
working on something big

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,039
in Chunjiang behind my back?

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,400
Nonsense.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Am I such a person?

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,759
I mean it.

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,039
I just want...

47
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,559
Want...

48
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:26,680
Is it okay?

49
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,159
I'm serious.

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,920
Meng'an is so lucky.

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,279
Lin,

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,839
why can't I

53
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,120
be as lucky as she is?

54
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,080
No,

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
you're not like us.

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,640
You're all about achieving big things

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,159
and fully committing to science.

58
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,719
After you.

59
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Let's do big things together.

60
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,999
Xin, look.

61
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,520
Little Watermelon is awake,

62
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,600
raising her little feet.

63
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,920
Is she cute?

64
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Are you missing your mom, huh?

65
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,120
Good girl.

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,160
Love you.

67
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,160
Love you, little feet.

68
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,120
Look at her little feet.

69
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,240
Hello, ma'am.

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,160
Your skin looks great.

71
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:02,959
Want to give

72
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,920
our cosmetics a try?

73
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,840
No, I'm good.

74
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,999
Are you hiring for a salesgirl?

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,879
Ms He.

76
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll go over there first.

77
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,720
Are you applying for our open positions?

78
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,399
You have a

79
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,559
great image.

80
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,639
Your makeup

81
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,160
is very well done.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,280
It seems like you

83
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,160
have a good understanding of

84
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,319
makeup and cosmetics, is that right?

85
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:37,559
The thing is that

86
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,680
we're looking for a staff who can

87
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,999
do live commerce.

88
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:40,720
Do you have any

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
relevant experience in that field?

90
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,999
I'd like to try it.

91
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,959
Hey girls, check out

92
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,840
this 10-color eyeshadow palette.

93
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,319
It feels really weighty in your hand.

94
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,600
There are ten different color options.

95
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,240
Personally,

96
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,999
I've tried out every color.

97
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,720
It's super practical

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
because you have soft,

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,800
shimmery, and pearlescent

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,759
options.

101
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,280
This color is great

102
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,160
for work

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,959
or when you're on the go.

104
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,040
Also, let me show you this.

105
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,559
It's sturdy

106
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,199
and has a lot of powder.

107
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,360
You can notice its impact in my hand.

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
The hue is quite subtle

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,360
and natural.

110
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
Haowen.

111
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,519
Haowen, Haowen.

112
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,160
Xin.

113
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,280
Did you check the video I sent to you?

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,999
Why are you doing live commerce?

115
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,720
Didn't you want to be an art teacher?

116
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,280
It is a waste of my pretty face

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,840
to be an art teacher.

118
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,639
Listen,

119
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,360
I've figured out

120
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,319
what we're going to do.

121
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,160
What?

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Live selling.

123
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,999
I don't know how to do that.

124
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:37,999
Our company did this before,

125
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:38,920
and we've screwed it up.

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
You screwed up the company

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,519
because you didn't know how to do it.

128
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,360
Remember how we started our company?

129
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,399
We began making imitative goods

130
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,040
in the garment market

131
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,999
and then ventured into our design and

132
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,959
branding business to open an online store.

133
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,439
We've always been ahead of the game,

134
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,120
except when

135
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,519
we switched to live commerce.

136
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,319
That's when we fell behind.

137
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,319
It's my fault.

138
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,319
I was too focused on

139
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,600
opening off-line stores

140
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,999
and missed the live commerce trend.

141
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,240
But we can make it right.

142
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,999
We're getting into live commerce now.

143
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,240
I'll do live commerce during work hours.

144
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,480
I'll continue it after off work.

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,800
Once I figure out how

146
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,519
live commerce works,

147
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:06,879
I'm confident that

148
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,160
with your experience in apparel,

149
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
we can definitely make a comeback.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,399
Then

151
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,319
we can clear away

152
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,879
this, this,

153
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,559
and this.

154
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,079
I will do live commerce here.

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,199
The big day is finally here.

156
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
Yeah.

157
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
Tomorrow is the high school entrance test.

158
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,920
Are you feeling a mix of

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,439
excitement and nerves?

160
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,559
I'm feeling okay.

161
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,079
I won't be able to go back tomorrow.

162
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,879
You won't blame me, will you?

163
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,600
No, I don't.

164
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
You must not

165
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,959
come back specifically

166
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,800
for my test.

167
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,559
It will only add pressure on me.

168
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,879
I won't.

169
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,240
Even if I want to, my boss won't

170
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,120
approve my leave,

171
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,680
right?

172
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,959
Then I'm feeling secure.

173
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,240
You both

174
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,680
must not give me pressure.

175
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,160
Let me sit the test

176
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,519
peacefully and

177
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,800
surprise you with my scores.

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,639
Really?

179
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,280
Are you bluffing?

180
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,800
Surprise us with your scores, huh?

181
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,840
You don't know who my mom is?

182
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,959
I'm born smart.

183
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,320
That's true.

184
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,360
Take it easy.

185
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,999
You can handle the test.

186
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,879
Come on.

187
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,039
Yunjie,

188
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,200
look what I made for

189
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,879
you!

190
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,840
Are you on a video call?

191
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,840
Li Lin,

192
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,919
don't stress Yunjie out too much.

193
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,720
Let her chill.

194
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:05,879
Listen,

195
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,480
don't feel anxious.

196
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,120
No big deal.

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,919
Even if you don't perform well,

198
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,159
you can follow my steps of

199
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,919
attending a nursing school and carrying

200
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,279
on our family tradition of practicing TCM.

201
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,560
Don't worry, aunt.

202
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,919
I will take the test seriously.

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Come on,

204
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,279
having a Must-Win Cake

205
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,639
ensures you an excellent score.

206
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,720
Aunt, is it reliable?

207
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,399
For sure.

208
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,120
In ancient times,

209
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,600
the famous general Yue Fei

210
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,240
ate this before going into battle.

211
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,279
Want some?

212
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,360
If not, I'll take it away.

213
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Yeah,

214
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,840
there's no harm in believing.

215
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,159
What if it comes true?

216
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,039
Right.

217
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
If you can dream it,

218
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,480
you can do it.

219
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,999
Look,

220
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,560
here's a gift for you.

221
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,480
It's like a dress

222
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,759
for the Spring Festival Gala.

223
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,999
Dad, look at it.

224
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,879
Xin said that this dress

225
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,759
will give you a great score,

226
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,960
so I bought it.

227
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,039
Okay.

228
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
I must wear it.

229
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,320
Alright, I will keep it for you.

230
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,320
Dad,

231
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,200
Mom and Aunt

232
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,399
both prepared gifts for me.

233
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,519
Where's your gift?

234
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,080
That reminds me.

235
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,999
What should I do?

236
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,240
I think I forget it.

237
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,999
You can't be here,

238
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,279
now even the gift, either?

239
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,799
Who's there?

240
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
Wait a moment.

241
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,039
Hello,

242
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,919
are you Li Yunjie.

243
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,879
Yes.

244
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,519
Your flowers.

245
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,720
Thank you.

246
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,919
Goodbye.

247
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,360
Bye.

248
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,560
Is this the gift you got for me?

249
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,759
Yes, secret gift for you.

250
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,799
Wish you stand first tomorrow.

251
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,080
Come on.

252
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,120
Come on.

253
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
I know

254
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,080
each gift you give me

255
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,240
contains your good wishes.

256
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,600
Thanks, Mom.

257
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
Thanks, aunt.

258
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,279
Thanks, Dad.

259
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,879
I really appreciate it.

260
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,560
Let me hug you.

261
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
Come on, Yunjie.

262
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,720
Mom,

263
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,999
can I sleep with you?

264
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,919
Sure, come here.

265
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay.

266
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,840
What's wrong?

267
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,799
Are you nervous about

268
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,639
tomorrow's test?

269
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,320
It's okay.

270
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:42,999
Mom,

271
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,919
how long before you

272
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,279
have your baby?

273
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,279
About

274
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,360
four weeks.

275
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,759
My test results

276
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,440
should be released by then.

277
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,279
Are you afraid?

278
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,200
Mom,

279
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,999
they say that

280
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:08,759
taking this exam is like

281
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,080
thousands of troops crossing

282
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,279
a narrow bridge. If you fall off

283
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,440
the bridge,

284
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,240
your life is basically over.

285
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,279
Who said that?

286
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,159
Life is never that simple.

287
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,080
A single test can't determine it.

288
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,279
What about

289
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,600
those successful folks

290
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,039
who didn't even

291
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,519
attend school or college?

292
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,879
What are their opinions?

293
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,080
Don't worry. There's always a way out.

294
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,399
Mom,

295
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,919
He Lu told me you'll

296
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,519
have your second baby in a few weeks.

297
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,039
After that, you won't

298
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,200
only be my mom.

299
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,480
Then, the baby

300
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,080
will be

301
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,039
your only sibling.

302
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Yunjie,

303
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,879
thanks to your presence,

304
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,159
Mom and Dad have experienced great joy

305
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,759
over the last decade.

306
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Therefore, we are confident that

307
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,039
the arrival of Little Grape

308
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,039
will double the happiness

309
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,919
of our family.

310
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,240
In the future,

311
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,279
you and Little Grape will grow up.

312
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,840
Me and your dad will grow old.

313
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,480
Then you and Little Grape

314
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,039
will be the closest ones in the world,

315
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,080
just like Jing and your Dad,

316
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,080
Me and Xin.

317
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,240
You two will never be apart

318
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,080
in your lifetime.

319
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,279
Isn't that good?

320
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,480
Yes.

321
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,720
Give me a hug.

322
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,039
You will be

323
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,440
a good sister.

324
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,440
Xin, is this place all for live commerce?

325
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,080
It is the biggest hub

326
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
for live commerce.

327
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,600
To start from scratch,

328
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,679
we must delve into

329
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,240
live commerce.

330
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,240
Am I correct?

331
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,360
Honey, you're amazing.

332
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,480
Is that a live commerce building?

333
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,480
This one.

334
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,440
Let's go.

335
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,639
Okay.

336
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,799
He is the famous...

337
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
who's his name?

338
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,799
You're the...

339
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,639
the...

340
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,480
I can't remember it...

341
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,720
Sorry.

342
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,639
Forget about it.

343
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,320
I just remembered.

344
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,893
I still can't remember.

345
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:16,240
Let's go.

346
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,440
We exclusively occupy

347
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
the live studios on this floor.

348
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,159
Our company has signed dozens of

349
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,320
e-commerce anchors

350
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,240
at various growth stages.

351
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:25,919
This face mask

352
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,600
hydrates the skin well.

353
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,679
Can I enter the room?

354
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,039
It also helps firm skin

355
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,560
and reduce

356
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,919
wrinkles.

357
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,560
This couple is

358
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,840
among the most popular anchors

359
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,080
of our live studios.

360
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,320
At first,

361
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,960
we didn't take notice of them.

362
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,039
However, their

363
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,440
homely style

364
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,039
has a solid appeal to the audience.

365
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
Customers appreciate this approach.

366
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,240
No need to strain your eyes.

367
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,240
Go inside to see closely.

368
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,519
Really?

369
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,039
Be quite.

370
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,759
This deal is too good to pass up.

371
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:51,879
Seriously,

372
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,360
this product

373
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,279
is a real bang for your buck.

374
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,560
Yeah, it works like a charm.

375
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,600
It won't make you look pale.

376
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,600
Come on, I'll remove

377
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,320
the makeup to show you.

378
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,720
No need, honey.

379
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,320
See,

380
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,799
the online audience

381
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,320
is zero.

382
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,360
The platform will soon

383
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,679
provide us with data traffic.

384
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,080
We need to stick to it.

385
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,879
Look at your sad expression.

386
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:58,679
Let me help you.

387
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,480
Don't bother.

388
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,720
I can do it.

389
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,519
Anyway, there is no online audience.

390
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,960
No one will notice it.

391
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,200
It takes time for the platform

392
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,720
to provide us with data traffic.

393
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,999
We have to tide over

394
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:09,879
the period where

395
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,919
there's no audience.

396
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,879
Then, the platform will

397
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,040
provide us with data traffic.

398
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,600
I think the platform

399
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,719
is ignoring us.

400
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,840
They are scamming us.

401
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,959
How could it be?

402
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,360
Don't we both agree to

403
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,320
stick it out

404
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,639
until we make it?

405
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,000
Your mouth is so dry.

406
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,840
Don't push yourself too hard.

407
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,959
I'll use some glycerin at night.

408
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,840
Look at these famous e-commerce anchors.

409
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
None of them got successful overnight.

410
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,360
They've really been through a lot.

411
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:33,959
Right? True.

412
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,399
No pain, no gain.

413
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,360
Honey, you're the best. You'll become

414
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,959
the most popular e-commerce anchor.

415
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
I know you have my back.

416
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,600
Let's steer clear of promoting lipsticks.

417
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,760
How about promoting face masks instead?

418
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,159
Okay.

419
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Check out this face mask. It is

420
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,639
a moisturizing mask made by Mizhiyan.

421
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,600
Lately, it's been scorching out.

422
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,439
Honey, check it out.

423
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,000
Online audiences

424
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,000
are entering.

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,840
Dear, check them out.

426
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,560
Those moisturizing masks

427
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,919
made by Mizhiyan

428
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,520
are sourced from

429
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
the shopping mall

430
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,879
and are guaranteed authentic.

431
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,560
Meng'an,

432
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,600
which one do you want?

433
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,399
Cherry tomatoes.

434
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:07,159
Okay.

435
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,840
Which one?

436
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,520
It's enough, Jing.

437
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,280
Take the tomatoes first.

438
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,159
Okay.

439
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,760
What if we have to wait for a long time?

440
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,600
It's sweet.

441
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,439
You can have more.

442
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,639
These facial masks

443
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,199
are not sourced from the shop mall.

444
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,199
This anchor is good.

445
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,199
It is a pretty good deal.

446
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,239
Jing, look at that.

447
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,399
Is that woman watching Mengxin?

448
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:34,639
I guarantee this is the best price

449
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,719
you'll find. If you want

450
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,320
this, purchase from the link No.1.

451
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,360
Excuse me,

452
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,679
ma'am.

453
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:41,600
Which platform

454
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,959
are you watching?

455
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,520
It is Taomao.

456
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
The anchor is my relative.

457
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,679
Oh, really?

458
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,760
By the way,

459
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,600
she looks fine.

460
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,000
You're so kind.

461
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,080
Honestly,

462
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,159
she looks better in real life.

463
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,520
She's not photogenic.

464
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,360
Really?

465
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,760
I found it.

466
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,040
It's indeed Mengxin.

467
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,719
Here comes the link No.1 for masks.

468
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:03,800
Okay.

469
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,399
Next is the link No.2.

470
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,159
When does she start doing this?

471
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,719
The link No.2 Is for

472
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
this celebrity lipstick. We keep

473
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,000
restocking this one for our audiences.

474
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,320
You look great.

475
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,199
This dress suits you well.

476
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,239
How's it going?

477
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,239
Are you glad wearing the old clothes?

478
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,199
Not really.

479
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,520
It must be hard for you in these years.

480
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,760
It's supposed to be Mom to comfort you.

481
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,199
No.

482
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,320
only you

483
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,760
can bring me comfort.

484
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,399
Here's a lipstick for you.

485
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,879
Look,

486
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,679
it's natural.

487
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,199
and safe for pregnant women.

488
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,320
The color looks nice, huh?

489
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,719
Where is it from?

490
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,560
The brand sends it

491
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
to me for the live streaming.

492
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,800
Did you quit the art teacher job?

493
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,360
Yes.

494
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:57,919
Your marriage with Haowen

495
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,639
is stable.

496
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,560
Why can't you be stable

497
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,479
in your career?

498
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:04,840
Why do you start nagging once you see me?

499
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,560
You're my sister.

500
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,639
Why can't I nag you?

501
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,280
Okay.

502
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,840
You're under the control of hormones.

503
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,239
I won't take your words to heart.

504
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,159
Let's talk seriously.

505
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,760
The boss of the art education school

506
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,159
is a scum.

507
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,320
Did he bully you?

508
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,159
He didn't dare to do it.

509
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,719
I threw a cup of sour liquid

510
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,760
all over him.

511
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,840
Did you disfigure him?

512
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,199
Just some lemon water.

513
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:30,520
You're

514
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,760
able to defend yourself now.

515
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,959
Yeah, I am making progress.

516
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,679
Why do you suddenly

517
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,000
want to do live commerce?

518
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
Why not try other jobs?

519
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,760
At first, I just wanted to try.

520
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,679
After discussing with Haowen,

521
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,320
we both think live commerce is good.

522
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,959
Think about it.

523
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,439
At first, Haowen and I

524
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,639
were unfamiliar with

525
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,479
live commerce.

526
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:51,800
That's why we fell behind

527
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,560
in the e-commerce.

528
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,280
We're now trying to

529
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,879
re-familiarize ourselves with this field.

530
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,040
Haowen and I will definitely

531
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,199
make it in the future.

532
00:20:58,399 --> 00:20:59,399
What do you think about it?

533
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,520
It is not impossible.

534
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,320
Live commerce

535
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,439
itself is

536
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,639
an enhanced e-commerce platform

537
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
that has become a part of

538
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,439
everyone's daily life.

539
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,719
In the long term, it shows potential.

540
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,520
However, live commerce is not easy.

541
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,840
It entails speaking extensively every day

542
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,520
and testing numerous products.

543
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Your lips are peeling, possibly because

544
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:23,959
you've been trying lots of lipsticks.

545
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,120
And those are just the tip of the iceberg.

546
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,560
There are many aspects related to

547
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,800
live commerce, such as sourcing channels,

548
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,239
product selection,

549
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,840
after-sales, handling returns,

550
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,199
and the risks

551
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,040
of criticism from your followers.

552
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,719
Have you taken them into account?

553
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,360
No.

554
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't want to consider them.

555
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,239
I only know l cannot

556
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,360
let Haowen shoulder

557
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,840
the family burden alone.

558
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,399
I have to help him.

559
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,280
The challenges you mentioned

560
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,280
are indeed

561
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,600
complex.

562
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,120
But every industry is challenging.

563
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,840
Doing good in one industry is harder.

564
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,399
However, Haowen and I have

565
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,919
overcome difficulties

566
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,080
to reach where we are today.

567
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,520
When we face challenges,

568
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,760
we discuss them

569
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,919
together,

570
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,000
just like

571
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,840
when we started from scratch.

572
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,199
If we could stick together

573
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:09,879
through the bad times

574
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,919
at the beginning,

575
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,520
why can't we do it now?

576
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:16,879
Well.

577
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,959
Also,

578
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,719
I love

579
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,320
live commerce,

580
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,959
right?

581
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
I can wear makeup

582
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,040
and try nice clothing

583
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,360
without spending a penny.

584
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,040
Is that cool?

585
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

586
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,040
Since you have decided,

587
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,000
I won't interfere with you.

588
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,000
Can you help me?

589
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,199
How?

590
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
You can do marketing

591
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,919
and planning.

592
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,280
I can't do it.

593
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,199
Why?

594
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:45,600
You just

595
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,959
talked a lot about it.

596
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,600
My salary is high.

597
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,959
Let's not talk about money.

598
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,919
Even with brothers, keep clear accounts.

599
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,120
We are sisters.

600
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,239
That's the same.

601
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,679
Give me my clothes.

602
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,879
I will never give you my clothes.

603
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:01,520
I don't want them.

604
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,679
You've been through a lot.

605
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm doing well.

606
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,520
My hormones are at the upper hand.

607
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,600
Take them down.

608
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,239
Take them down.

609
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,120
Relax.

610
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,080
Dear,

611
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,479
check out the number one product today.

612
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:05,520
It is a

613
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,560
super hydrating face mask.

614
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,719
The mask

615
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,080
is made of plant fiber,

616
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,679
which sticks to

617
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,959
the skin better.

618
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,560
Let's see what's

619
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,479
inside the mask package.

620
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,199
Dad,

621
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,800
here you are.

622
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,719
There are five serum bottles

623
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:23,959
and five sheets.

624
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,560
Each serum bottle

625
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,360
has 1.5 ml of

626
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,000
hydrating essence

627
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,439
packed with hydrating ingredients.

628
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,639
When using the mask,

629
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,399
apply the serum first.

630
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:35,840
Dear,

631
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
you're all like family to me.

632
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,719
But

633
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,639
my parents

634
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:41,120
are coming to visit,

635
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,000
so I need to take time off

636
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,719
to spend with them.

637
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:44,239
I'll return in 15 minutes

638
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,360
to continue

639
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,600
hanging out with you all.

640
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,840
I will go gently,

641
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,520
just as I will

642
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,159
come back gently later.

643
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,080
See you.

644
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,639
Well done.

645
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Hurry, I'm sweating.

646
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,199
Take a seat.

647
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,159
Have some food.

648
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:57,919
Dad.

649
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,800
Xin,

650
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,719
have more cucumber to cool down.

651
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:01,520
It's delicious.

652
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,320
I'm eating.

653
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:03,600
The braised pork made by Dad

654
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,360
tastes really good.

655
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,560
Xin always enjoys Dad's cooking.

656
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,120
How about the soup I made?

657
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:09,879
It's so tasty that

658
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:11,439
I can't stop myself from having more.

659
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,439
Remember to

660
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,360
drink that beverage tea.

661
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,040
Sure.

662
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,320
It contains boat-fruited sterculia seed.

663
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,080
Time's almost up.

664
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:19,439
Wait, what's that?

665
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,000
Let me see it.

666
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,239
It's okay.

667
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:20,840
Let me take a look.

668
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,800
Your lips are chapping.

669
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,159
Mom,

670
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,040
I'll take care of Xin.

671
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,639
I'll put on some glycerin before bed.

672
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,199
Does it hurt?

673
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,959
Mom, it is the golden time

674
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,199
to reach more online audiences

675
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,320
and gain more followers.

676
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,840
Yes.

677
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,000
You should go home to take rest.

678
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:35,639
Xin,

679
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,000
can I give you some advice?

680
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
I see you're selling lipsticks

681
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
and facial masks now,

682
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,840
aren't you?

683
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,280
Can everyone,

684
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
regardless of age or gender,

685
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,840
use the masks?

686
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:45,159
Yes.

687
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:45,679
You're right.

688
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,760
Later, you can say,

689
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,879
dear,

690
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,639
hello,

691
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,199
this is my mom.

692
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,040
She's over 60 years old.

693
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,439
My mom didn't look like this

694
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,000
previously.

695
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
After using this facial mask...

696
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,360
Then, you show your mom to the audience,

697
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,239
saying, take a look.

698
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,479
Doesn't she look in her 40s

699
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:00,600
instead of over 60?

700
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:00,959
Good.

701
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,800
The audience will then rush to

702
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,080
make a purchase. Does that sound good?

703
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,040
Yeah,

704
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,719
I've seen this strategy

705
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,439
used in

706
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,360
other live commerce streams.

707
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,199
Give me a break.

708
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:10,479
Mom, Mom.

709
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,760
You can apply the filter to my face.

710
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,239
I can try the lipsticks.

711
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,120
Time's running out.

712
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,560
I can assist you with the lipsticks.

713
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,280
Look at me.

714
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,800
I'll consider it,

715
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,120
alright?

716
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,040
You can brainstorm some aliases first.

717
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,479
For example, my name is Auntie Xu.

718
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,479
Once you come up with a name,

719
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,000
you can do the live commerce.

720
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,959
Next time, we will host a live commerce

721
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,320
event featuring both of you.

722
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,040
Auntie Xiaoli.

723
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,840
Alright.

724
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,159
Xin's Auntie Xu.

725
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,479
We can not be the same generation.

726
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:29,959
I can't...

727
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,159
Well, how about

728
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:31,600
Granny Xu?

729
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,479
I disagree.

730
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,600
Make it young.

731
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,520
Little Sister Li'ning.

732
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,560
Little Sister Li'ning,

733
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:37,840
hurry up and go home.

734
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,719
Little Sister.

735
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:39,280
It's time to go home.

736
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,479
Remember to turn on the AC.

737
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,199
Then we are leaving.

738
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:41,439
Okay.

739
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,120
Bring the umbrella.

740
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,679
See you.

741
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,840
Don't worry.

742
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,719
Then go home early.

743
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:45,800
I'll be back soon.

744
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,239
Don't worry.

745
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:46,959
Don't be too tired.

746
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:47,719
Alright.

747
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,239
Dad, take it easy.

748
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:48,959
Wrap it up early.

749
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,360
I got it.

750
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,959
Don't get sunburned.

751
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,840
Go back to turn on the AC.

752
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:54,760
What idea were you thinking of?

753
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,080
The idea is brilliant.

754
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,320
How can I be 40 years old?

755
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,320
Don't doubt it.

756
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,879
You look exactly...

757
00:26:58,879 --> 00:26:59,679
They care about you.

758
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,399
like 40 years old.

759
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:01,639
You look like 41 years old.

760
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:07,199
Let's continue.

761
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,679
Xin is

762
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,280
working

763
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,800
and livestreaming.

764
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,600
She talks non-stop every single day,

765
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,719
repeating herself

766
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,560
over and over again.

767
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:25,120
Her lips are chapping,

768
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,600
and her voice sounds strained.

769
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,159
What kind of life

770
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,959
is she living?

771
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:31,679
Before this...

772
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,320
But now,

773
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,239
she's struggling a lot,

774
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,560
which has never

775
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,280
happened before.

776
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:42,280
Your lips are dry.

777
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,280
Take one sip.

778
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,679
I never imagined that doing live commerce

779
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,159
can be so demanding.

780
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,080
You're right.

781
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm really concerned about them.

782
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,520
How can we

783
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,000
help her?

784
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,840
I listen to you.

785
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,600
Since we're getting older,

786
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,199
the best thing we can do is

787
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,080
support them in caring for

788
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,399
the children to lessen their burden.

789
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:10,120
Yeah,

790
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,879
you're right.

791
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:12,879
If anyone

792
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:14,560
dares to say that

793
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,600
Xin is spoiled and unreasonable,

794
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,080
I won't let them get away with it.

795
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,399
Sure.

796
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:23,399
It's so hard for Xin.

797
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,639
Don't cry.

798
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,199
Your tears are making me want to cry.

799
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,600
I feel like crying.

800
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,000
Then

801
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,600
I won't cry.

802
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,360
You're making me teary-eyed.

803
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,159
No, don't cry.

804
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:42,919
I will stop crying.

805
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,840
But you're crying so much.

806
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,399
It feels like I don't

807
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,159
care about Xin if I don't cry.

808
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:48,399
Don't cry.

809
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,639
Then you stop crying,

810
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,280
alright?

811
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm trying to

812
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,840
hold back my tears.

813
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,639
I won't cry.

814
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:56,080
Let's go back home.

815
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,120
Let's go.

816
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:57,840
Go home.

817
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,800
Please don't cry.

818
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,639
You're doing great.

819
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:00,719
Li'ning, keep it up.

820
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,120
Look,

821
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,840
that guy seems suspicious.

822
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,199
Why are you staring at me?

823
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,120
Focus on the movie.

824
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,439
The movie isn't as attractive as you.

825
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:27,040
But you can't just keep staring at me.

826
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,280
Do I bother you?

827
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,760
No, I'm so happy.

828
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,679
How long has it been

829
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,439
since last time we've

830
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
had some alone time here

831
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,520
like this?

832
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,840
Since Yunjie

833
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,639
was born,

834
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:49,919
we've always gone to the movies as a trio.

835
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:52,560
We never missed a single animated movie.

836
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,520
Yunjie is so lucky.

837
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,360
Do you recall the first movie

838
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,760
we watched together?

839
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,840
What is it?

840
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,080
Jurassic Park.

841
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,120
Yeah.

842
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,919
Titanic was playing, too.

843
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,919
Why did you

844
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,199
take me to see Jurassic Park?

845
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,959
Jurassic Park was so thrilling.

846
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
I remember Mei Yiduo

847
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,040
called you during the movie.

848
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,520
Did she?

849
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:29,840
Yes.

850
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,159
Didn't you answer the phone

851
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:33,879
later?

852
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,320
What did Mei Yiduo

853
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,120
say to you on the phone?

854
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:41,360
I answered the phone.

855
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,520
What else could she have said?

856
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,639
What do you want her to say?

857
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:46,040
I...

858
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,560
I overthink things too much.

859
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:51,760
Will Mei Yiduo

860
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,320
call you later?

861
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,600
No chance.

862
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,360
I've switched off my phone.

863
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,639
You're making me feel paranoid.

864
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,600
It's not you who's paranoid.

865
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,919
It's your hormones

866
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,679
at play.

867
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,479
My heart is racing fast.

868
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,919
It'll slow down if you stop staring at me.

869
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,120
Let me look at you

870
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,239
for a moment.

871
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:26,919
Don't look at me.

872
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,439
Watch the movie.

873
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,080
The female character is not beautiful.

874
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:32,919
I prefer to watch you.

875
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,800
Okay.

876
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,879
Are you going to leave soon?

877
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:53,959
I just took one day off.

878
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,679
When are you coming back?

879
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,280
Next week. I'll be back.

880
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,760
I'll talk to Mei Yiduo

881
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,919
to see if she...

882
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,520
Where's the milk tea shop?

883
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,439
Why does this girl

884
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:17,120
look like Yunjie?

885
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,679
Hello, Mr and Mrs Li.

886
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,399
Are you two hanging out as well?

887
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,600
You're right.

888
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,120
Adults are liars.

889
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,840
How's the popcorn?

890
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,239
How's the movie?

891
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,040
What a coincidence.

892
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,159
Yunjie,

893
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,479
what's up?

894
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,919
You seem upset.

895
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,959
Say something.

896
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,639
Aunt,

897
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:10,560
Mom and Dad were too much.

898
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,000
They went to

899
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,879
the movies,

900
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,760
had a date,

901
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,159
and enjoyed popcorn without me.

902
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,199
Your Dad?

903
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:16,760
Yes.

904
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,679
Yeah, he's back.

905
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,239
They were munching on popcorn.

906
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,560
It's junk food.

907
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,080
Where is he?

908
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,000
He's back to Beijing.

909
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,439
He's so busy?

910
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,399
He passed by our home

911
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,639
and did not even come back?

912
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,280
He's always busy

913
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
helping the country develop.

914
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,919
He got a round-trip ticket for one day.

915
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,959
How did he find time to watch movies

916
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:38,439
and hang out?

917
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,159
Snatch a little leisure from a busy life.

918
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,239
Liars!

919
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,040
Say, how many times did he come back?

920
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,840
Does he come back often?

921
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,919
No, he doesn't.

922
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,040
Just this time.

923
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,840
And Yunjie ran into us.

924
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,840
Movie theaters can be very noisy.

925
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,520
Did it affect the baby?

926
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:53,399
We were watching an art film.

927
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,360
It was very dull,

928
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,679
and I ended up falling asleep.

929
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,040
Was the baby moving?

930
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,560
Yes, it was.

931
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,639
In fact, its movements woke me up.

932
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:03,919
It was really active,

933
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,120
and it's still moving.

934
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,000
Do you want to feel it?

935
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,760
Touch it.

936
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
It's moving.

937
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:14,159
It's so active.

938
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,400
It's uncomfortable at times.

939
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,600
That's abnormal.

940
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,679
It's moving too often.

941
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,679
Let's head to the hospital

942
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,440
for a fetal heart rate monitoring.

943
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,600
Is mom going to give birth?

944
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,319
I want to go, too.

945
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,199
You're not going with us.

946
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,159
Just stay at home.

947
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,319
Nah, it's still a few weeks left.

948
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,759
Maybe it's a false alarm.

949
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,120
Listen to me.

950
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,359
Go to the hospital.

951
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,600
Does it hurt?

952
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,080
Yes.

953
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:42,159
You're getting regular contractions.

954
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,600
Time to head into the ward for the labor.

955
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:50,920
Jing,

956
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,239
what's going on?

957
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,159
How's it going?

958
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
How's An?

959
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,679
Her cervix has expanded 4 centimeters.

960
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,759
Where is Lin?

961
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,880
I can't reach him on the phone.

962
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,839
I've been calling.

963
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,600
Keep calling.

964
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,120
Doctor,

965
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,279
how's it going?

966
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,520
The woman's in labor.

967
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,440
Only one person can accompany her.

968
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,080
I will.

969
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,279
That's great.

970
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:08,520
No matter Meng'an has a boy or a girl,

971
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,600
our family will thrive.

972
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,080
Health is the most important.

973
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
You're right.

974
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,239
It's a joyful thing.

975
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:16,319
What do you think?

976
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:18,080
Is it a boy or a girl?

977
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,440
Xin.

978
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,880
Dad, Mom.

979
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:21,600
Xin.

980
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,239
Does the baby arrive?

981
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:22,679
Yes.

982
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,239
Come on.

983
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:23,920
Come on.

984
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,839
Is it a boy or a girl?

985
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,319
A boy.

986
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
One son and one daughter.

987
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,159
Let me see.

988
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,040
It's so joyful, Mom.

989
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,359
Come on.

990
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,920
Send the baby video to Lin.

991
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:35,480
Where is he?

992
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,359
He's on the plane.

993
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,839
Why didn't he come back earlier

994
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:40,159
for Meng'an big day?

995
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,639
He's back.

996
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:42,920
He got back yesterday.

997
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,319
They even went to see a movie.

998
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,920
Why did he go?

999
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,839
He didn't know Meng'an was giving birth.

1000
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,279
He had work to do, so he left.

1001
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,319
When he got the call

1002
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:51,440
at the airport,

1003
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,880
he hung around all night

1004
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,440
to catch an early flight back.

1005
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,319
Hurry up, send it.

1006
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,520
He's on the way back.

1007
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,920
Even though Xin sends the video,

1008
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,040
Lin can't receive it as he's on the plane.

1009
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,440
Once he lands,

1010
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,199
he will be able to

1011
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,000
see his son immediately.

1012
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,799
Am I right?

1013
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,600
That's true.

1014
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,319
Go ahead.

1015
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:09,679
Come on.

1016
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,040
Honey,

1017
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,560
honey,

1018
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:23,600
I'm sorry,

1019
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,600
I'm sorry.

1020
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:26,839
I...

1021
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,560
I shouldn't

1022
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,719
have left last night.

1023
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,719
I'm sorry.

1024
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,639
Lin,

1025
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,839
why do you come back?

1026
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,040
I can do it myself.

1027
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,080
Nonsense.

1028
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,759
That's not the point.

1029
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,639
What if Mei Yiduo...

1030
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,440
what if she

1031
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,880
is upset with you?

1032
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,440
You've been taking leaves quite often.

1033
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:55,719
Why do you

1034
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,880
bring her up now?

1035
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,679
I'm worried that she might fire you.

1036
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
Then, I will quit the job myself.

1037
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,480
Is she still human

1038
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,159
if she doesn't let me

1039
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,480
come back at this moment?

1040
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:08,520
I'm sorry.

1041
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,239
Well,

1042
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:13,520
can I just let my hormones

1043
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,040
take over now?

1044
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,239
Sure.

1045
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,319
Let it be.

1046
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,239
Let me

1047
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:20,920
give you a hug.

1048
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:29,759
You did a great job.

1049
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,000
Your mom had a boy,

1050
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,880
and you got into high school.

1051
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,000
It's a double joy for our family.

1052
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,000
Yes.

1053
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,440
I wasn't expecting

1054
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,400
Little Grape to be a boy.

1055
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,520
Silly girl,

1056
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,920
a boy is great.

1057
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:55,960
Aunt,

1058
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,159
you're valuing boys over girls.

1059
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm putting myself

1060
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,239
in your mom's shoes.

1061
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:00,880
Think over it.

1062
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,319
Meng'an already has you,

1063
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,839
and now she's got a boy.

1064
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,839
It's like double the joy. Am I right?

1065
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,880
I know what you're thinking.

1066
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,480
Little Grape,

1067
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,239
I'm your sister!

1068
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,639
Do you remember me?

1069
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,279
When you were still in Mom's belly,

1070
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:21,799
I told you stories daily.

1071
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,120
My name is Li Yunjie,

1072
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
and you can

1073
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
just call me Yunjie.

1074
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,480
From now on, you have to listen to me,

1075
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,440
okay?

1076
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Yunjie, you're quite the chatterbox.

1077
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,279
How about giving me a chance to chime in?

1078
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,880
Didn't you talk enough last night?

1079
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,400
Just leave me alone forever.

1080
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,679
Are you still angry?

1081
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,199
You didn't inform her you had returned.

1082
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:50,920
She's envious.

1083
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,319
It's my bad last night.

1084
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,679
I just wanted to date with your mom

1085
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,880
like we used to be.

1086
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:00,319
I missed

1087
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:01,560
my chance,

1088
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,520
you know?

1089
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,000
Is your son just so cute?

1090
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,279
Yeah, he is.

1091
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,560
Yunjie,

1092
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:14,839
did you get

1093
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,080
the high school acceptance letter?

1094
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,679
Is it a big deal for you?

1095
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Yes, it is.

1096
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,159
No, not really.

1097
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,040
It's not as crucial as your precious son.

1098
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,080
What should I do,

1099
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,679
Son.

1100
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,799
Your sister is starting to

1101
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:31,199
dislike me.

1102
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,839
What should I do moving forward?

1103
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,239
When I'm old, I have to depend on you.

1104
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,480
You have to go shopping with Dad,

1105
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,400
alright?

1106
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:39,679
Let's listen to music and

1107
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,759
go to the public bathhouse

1108
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,279
to do the spa together.

1109
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,000
Hello?

1110
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,639
It's a boy.

1111
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,759
Yes.

1112
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:47,639
Now you have

1113
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,400
a grandson.

1114
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,120
There's a male heir to our Li family.

1115
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,120
Yes.

1116
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:57,159
Yunjie.

1117
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,839
Come on.

1118
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,639
Hurry up and

1119
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,080
pick a name for the baby.

1120
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,359
The boy's name must be meaningful.

1121
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,679
Don't pick any random names.

1122
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,199
Relax.

1123
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Hurry up

1124
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,799
and get Yunjie back.

1125
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:07,600
Yunjie,

1126
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:08,960
where does she go?

1127
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,120
Haven't you just seen it?

1128
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,159
If you don't

1129
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:11,679
get her back,

1130
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,719
you cannot get back to see me.

1131
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,239
Did I make a mistake again?

1132
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,080
Hurry up.

1133
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:17,639
Okay, take it easy.

1134
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,319
Watch out for the baby.

1135
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,159
Off you go.

1136
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:19,520
Okay.

1137
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,239
Stop dragging your feet.

1138
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,239
Let's wrap up the call.

1139
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,120
Could you lower your voice?

1140
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,400
Remember, you used to be a head nurse.

1141
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,120
I was telling the good news.

1142
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,839
Now, the Li Family has a grandson.

1143
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:36,440
Yunjie,

1144
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,279
wait for me.

1145
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,279
I'm exhausted.

1146
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:41,319
Why are you walking so fast?

1147
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,279
I'm not waiting.

1148
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,239
Your son's a real gem.

1149
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,319
You should go back and check on him.

1150
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,080
I'm old.

1151
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,400
No, you can't say stuff like that.

1152
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,679
So, if you're old,

1153
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
what's that make me?

1154
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,920
How old am I supposed to be?

1155
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:53,400
You're not afraid of getting old.

1156
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Your son can serve you.

1157
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,639
He can even rub your back.

1158
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm only counting on your brother

1159
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,799
to rub my back.

1160
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,639
For other things,

1161
00:41:58,799 --> 00:41:59,239
I'm still counting on you

1162
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,120
in the future.

1163
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:00,719
Am I correct?

1164
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,960
You can rub your mom's back

1165
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,000
if you want to.

1166
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
We girls don't

1167
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,120
do things like rubbing backs.

1168
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,799
Okay,

1169
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,000
I got it.

1170
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:14,520
I have something serious to tell you.

1171
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:15,719
I've

1172
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,799
signed you up

1173
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:17,799
for a summer camp

1174
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,759
in Beijing.

1175
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:19,400
Do you want to go?

1176
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,719
Didn't I promise to

1177
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,359
take you on a trip

1178
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:23,279
this summer vacation?

1179
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,120
Let's take

1180
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,319
this opportunity to

1181
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,239
climb the Great Wall,

1182
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,239
walk down Chang'an Avenue,

1183
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,120
and visit the Forbidden City, Temple of

1184
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Heaven, Shichahai, and the Summer Palace.

1185
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,199
We can try Peking Duck,

1186
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,159
noodles with soybean paste,

1187
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,279
mutton hotpot,

1188
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,279
rolling soybean cake,

1189
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,440
and Chinese crepes.

1190
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,639
Does it count?

1191
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,839
You can eat it anyway.

1192
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,159
Are you finished?

1193
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,799
It will be great fun.

1194
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:46,679
I thought you

1195
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,960
forgot your promise.

1196
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:49,440
No way.

1197
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,520
I'll forget anything else

1198
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:51,440
but not

1199
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,600
the promise I made to you.

1200
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,120
What about my mom?

1201
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,839
It's the

1202
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,359
same case.

1203
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:58,639
Who do you like better, me or Mom?

1204
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,960
Yunjie,

1205
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,880
why are you making me choose between you

1206
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,199
and Mom, especially here by the river?

1207
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:05,520
I can't answer it

1208
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,560
I like your grandma the most.

1209
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:07,480
No,

1210
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,279
you must answer my question.

1211
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:20,520
Don't run away.

1212
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,799
What's up?

1213
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:25,359
Are you okay?

1214
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,759
You've told the truth.

1215
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm getting older.

1216
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,239
Don't call me old in the future, okay?

1217
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:31,639
Come on.

1218
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,239
If you didn't run, that wouldn't happen.

1219
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,159
So,

1220
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:35,239
I'll still need to

1221
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,199
rely on you in the future,

1222
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:36,719
right?
