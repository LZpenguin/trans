[Just in Time]
[EP40]

3
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,999
With this, you'll have

4
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,400
two lab projects in hand.

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,719
That makes you

6
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,040
a big shot in our industry

7
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,800
for the future.

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,919
So, how do you feel about it?

9
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,359
Where will I work?

10
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,760
Still in Beijing?

11
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,839
Yeah, in Beijing.

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,040
Yiduo,

13
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,240
first of all,

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,639
I want to thank you

15
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,919
for your support and trust.

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,839
However,

17
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,559
I still hope you can fulfill

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,159
your initial promise.

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Our lab is now

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,839
officially listed and operational.

21
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,879
Then, I'll go home.

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Don't worry.

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Now that

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,640
I have the experience here,

25
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,080
finding a job back home

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,480
should be quite easy.

27
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,439
Li Lin.

28
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,800
Your potential goes far beyond this.

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,800
Don't always think about going home.

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,279
You're at the prime age

31
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,960
for a researcher.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,759
It's the best time to produce results.

33
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,159
I'm not exaggerating.

34
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,520
I always knew

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,039
you were

36
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,240
very capable.

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
But after working together

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,439
this time,

39
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,120
your abilities

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
exceeded my expectations.

41
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,080
Every day,

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,559
you surprise us.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,240
Li Lin, you're really amazing,

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
you know that?

45
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,999
No need to flatter me;

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
I'm very aware

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,839
of my own level.

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,839
What I told you earlier,

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,920
I've seriously thought it through.

50
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,839
How about this:

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
let's wait until next month

52
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,719
when our lab is

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,080
officially listed and operational.

54
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,039
I really need to go back.

55
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:25,559
Seriously.

56
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,480
I really need to go back,

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
or I won't feel settled

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,879
working here.

59
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,800
What do you think?

60
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,839
I understand.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,559
Forget what

62
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,640
I just told you.

63
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,200
Li Lin.

64
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,159
I have more good news.

65
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,080
Want to hear it?

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,559
More good news?

67
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,680
What is it?

68
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,480
Letting me go home

69
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,640
for a break?

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,159
You're thinking too small.

71
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,319
Hello?

72
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,480
Jing?

73
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,199
I thought I was seeing things!

74
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,920
When did you get back?

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,879
Surprised?

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,840
Why did you come back?

77
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,360
So suddenly?

78
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,480
I had to come back.

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,280
If I didn't, you all

80
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,639
would've forgotten me.

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,439
Well, it wouldn't have gone that far.

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,759
Really? He doesn't know me anymore.

83
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,199
I've been coaxing him for ages,

84
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,120
yet he won't sleep.

85
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,240
Seriously?

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,879
Did you take the early flight?

87
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes, early flight.

88
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,519
Today, Daddy's going to

89
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,999
spend the whole day

90
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,840
getting to know you better,

91
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
Little Grape.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,040
You don't love me anymore?

93
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,519
Why do you say so?

94
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,840
Shouldn't you get to know

95
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
your wife first?

96
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,079
Jealous?

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,399
Come here, my big baby.

98
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,639
Let's catch up.

99
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,439
I've missed you so much.

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
We missed you too.

101
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm back.

102
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,840
I'm back.

103
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,600
Ms Xu,

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,079
we went back and conducted research

105
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,040
and reviewed the live stream.

106
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,879
We believe that

107
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,240
if you and Dongzi

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,199
team up as a couple,

109
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
the Dongzi family fans

110
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,720
will be very receptive.

111
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
And your commercial value

112
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,840
will increase.

113
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,999
This would be

114
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,160
very beneficial for you.

115
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,920
Relax,

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,519
I have no interest in you.

117
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,720
The contract.

118
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,639
Sure, let me take a look.

119
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,399
Sign this contract,

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
and here's the deposit.

121
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,079
Mengxin, isn't that sincere enough?

122
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,439
Let me share this good news

123
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,519
with my husband.

124
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Look, look at Mommy.

126
00:06:58,999 --> 00:06:59,800
Mom.

127
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Mom.

128
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,680
Where's Jing?

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Went grocery shopping?

130
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:04,999
No, she went back home.

131
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,920
Did you say something unpleasant again?

132
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,559
Drove her away?

133
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,040
What unpleasant thing?

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
Am I that kind of person?

135
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,639
She has been here

136
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,840
looking after the kids

137
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,559
for so long.

138
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,519
She needed a good rest,

139
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,639
so, I let her go back.

140
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,079
Besides,

141
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,840
I took a month off.

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,840
You took a month off?

143
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,280
A whole month?

144
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah, a month.

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Don't tell me you're unemployed again?

146
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,399
Can't you wish me well for once?

147
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,639
Well, normally,

148
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,639
what boss would

149
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,920
give an employee a month off?

150
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Ms Mei would.

151
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
No way.

152
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,559
That she-devil?

153
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,040
Did something happen between you two,

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
and you ran back?

155
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,879
Is your pregnancy hormone

156
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,759
acting up again?

157
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,079
Then speak properly to me.

158
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,120
Don't talk nonsense.

159
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
Now that our lab

160
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,840
is operating normally,

161
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,040
I was allowed to take a month off.

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
So, are you staying home

163
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,840
for the whole month?

164
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,360
Yes, the whole month.

165
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,879
Not going anywhere.

166
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,879
I'm reclaiming my lost

167
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,439
family status.

168
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Go for it!

169
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,199
Go for it!

170
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,240
What are we doing?

171
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,879
We're fist-bumping.

172
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,240
Come on,

173
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,360
Here.

174
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Come on.

175
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,040
Let's do it again!

176
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,040
Go for it!

177
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,079
Here.

178
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,360
Let me hold you.

179
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,280
I'll give you to Mom, okay?

180
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,720
Okay?

181
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,720
Or do you want Daddy?

182
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,639
Okay.

183
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,999
Just a quick hug,

184
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:27,759
and then give him back to me.

185
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,399
If you want to

186
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,680
reclaim your family status,

187
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,439
go cook.

188
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,120
Hungry already?

189
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,879
Let me hold him a bit longer.

190
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,040
Be good.

191
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,279
Go get to know your dad better.

192
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,120
Here.

193
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,080
I'll cook for you both later.

194
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,320
You smell so good.

195
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,279
Very good.

196
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,080
Wanzhen,

197
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,360
what's wrong with you?

198
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
Did something happen

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
between you and Yu Hai recently?

200
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,360
Don't tell me old feelings have rekindled?

201
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,560
No way.

202
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,720
Then what's going on?

203
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:06,919
Are you planning to

204
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,840
go against all the investors

205
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,600
to help Yu Hai?

206
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,679
Mr Zhou.

207
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,279
I'm just being realistic.

208
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,279
This is a rational judgment

209
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,639
based on Blue Ocean's

210
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,320
current situation.

211
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,600
Although Blue Ocean didn't

212
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
meet the conditions of the bet this time,

213
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,879
I don't think it's the best choice

214
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,519
for us investors to cash out and leave.

215
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,560
I don't think

216
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,440
this is the best decision.

217
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,039
So, you're standing by Yu Hai?

218
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,679
I'm not standing by anyone.

219
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,159
I'm doing this

220
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,159
based on my understanding

221
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,159
and judgment of Blue Ocean.

222
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,240
Blue Ocean is just

223
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
one project for Yaohui Co.

224
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,519
We have

225
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,360
many others.

226
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
There's no need to offend

227
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,960
all the investors for one project.

228
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,759
True,

229
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,759
it's just a project

230
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,840
for us.

231
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,679
But for its founder,

232
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,440
it's ten years of his life's work.

233
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,200
We must take it seriously.

234
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,720
Wanzhen,

235
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,919
I think you've

236
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,519
invested too much energy into Blue Ocean.

237
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,159
It's not worth it.

238
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,039
If the founder

239
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,120
wasn't your ex-husband,

240
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,159
would you care this much?

241
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,159
Of course I would.

242
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,799
I'm a professional investor.

243
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,039
This is my professional judgment.

244
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,039
Then are you willing to bet with me?

245
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,960
Bet on what?

246
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,720
If you believe in

247
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,799
Blue Ocean's future,

248
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,960
then temporarily give up

249
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,519
your position as Investment Director

250
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,600
and your partnership.

251
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,999
Hand over all your projects

252
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:19,879
and leave Yaohui Co.

253
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,759
Join Blue Ocean

254
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,679
as a shareholder representative.

255
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,440
Achieve the project goals

256
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
and prove your investment vision.

257
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,240
Then I'll let you come back.

258
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,519
If you fail, don't ever come back.

259
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,759
Go down with Yu Hai.

260
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,360
This is your only chance.

261
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,480
Do you dare to bet?

262
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,999
What's wrong?

263
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,200
Were the contract terms

264
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,840
he offered harsh?

265
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,159
How's the profit sharing?

266
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,560
Make a guess.

267
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
How would I know?

268
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
No profit sharing.

269
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,999
No profit sharing?

270
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,720
Why should I share with him?

271
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,720
He's helping you for free,

272
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,159
bringing in traffic, and

273
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,999
letting you earn money. No profit sharing?

274
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,999
He must have taken a liking to you.

275
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,360
I didn't sign with him.

276
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,480
Why should I share?

277
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:09,999
You didn't sign?

278
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,519
Why didn't you sign with him?

279
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,639
Why didn't you sign with him?

280
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,120
Jia Haowen,

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,159
do you want me

282
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,919
to sign with him or not?

283
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:20,999
I've thought it over.

284
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,240
Why should I sign with him?

285
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,159
We can do it ourselves

286
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,240
just fine.

287
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,560
I'll talk to my sister tomorrow.

288
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,480
I don't believe

289
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,279
without him,

290
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,039
I can't make it.

291
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,840
Honey,

292
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,679
I admire you so much.

293
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,120
I admire you so much.

294
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,279
Without you, I, Jia Haowen, am nothing.

295
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,840
No.

296
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
You're my husband.

297
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,919
Happy now?

298
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
That's more like it.

299
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,919
Who was that just now,

300
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,320
glaring at me?

301
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,999
Now you're tough.

302
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,159
Try being fierce with me again.

303
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,200
No profit sharing.

304
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,840
Just these five items?

305
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,039
Yes.

306
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
Just these five?

307
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,200
There are more on the way.

308
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,120
The ones that my folks in hometown bought

309
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,799
are still en route.

310
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,519
Because I paid

311
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,120
for ten items.

312
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,799
Yeah, fine.

313
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,840
Quickly, unpack them all.

314
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,919
Then put them

315
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,120
in Xin's room,

316
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,279
along with

317
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,080
the unsold ones.

318
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:14,799
Unpack them all.

319
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,999
Unpack everything.

320
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,799
In-law!

321
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,399
In-law!

322
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:21,600
Be quick.

323
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm here!

324
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:23,840
Well...

325
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,120
Did you buy these too?

326
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,399
Come, come.

327
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:36,999
Give them to me.

328
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,039
I was thinking of you,

329
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,720
so, I brought some local specialties

330
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,679
from back home.

331
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,679
Why are you here again?

332
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,120
I wanted to see you.

333
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,360
I missed you.

334
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,200
Look at all these things.

335
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,200
In-law,

336
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,639
I bought some too.

337
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,639
This time,

338
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,919
I mobilized

339
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,039
all my relatives

340
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,960
from the northeast

341
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,919
to support us.

342
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,799
Right, right.

343
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,200
Same here.

344
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Back home,

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
I got all my relatives, friends,

346
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,120
and neighbors

347
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,159
to buy some.

348
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,039
I paid for everything.

349
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,919
Same with us.

350
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah.

351
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,159
We paid too.

352
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,720
I told them not to send to me;

353
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,480
just keep it

354
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,279
for themselves.

355
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,840
I didn't expect it.

356
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,759
I thought

357
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,999
I was just buying for them.

358
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:22,560
You know what?

359
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,200
Some even sent them back.

360
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,159
Have some fruit.

361
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,639
The kids have it tough.

362
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,200
Exactly.

363
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,720
When I went to their live stream,

364
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,039
I saw them putting on

365
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,120
and wiping off lipstick

366
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,960
repeatedly

367
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,120
until their lips were chapped.

368
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,919
Yeah,

369
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,879
Haowen too.

370
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,159
Can you believe

371
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:41,840
a grown man doing that?

372
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,120
I actually think it looks pretty good.

373
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,240
Those two kids,

374
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
their company

375
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,039
was booming back then.

376
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
Then suddenly, the company was gone.

377
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,720
I mean...

378
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,999
I'm really worried about them.

379
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,759
I'm afraid

380
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,999
they might be mentally crushed

381
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,039
and never recover.

382
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,159
What can we do?

383
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,759
But look at them now.

384
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,720
So much better.

385
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,120
Yeah,

386
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,720
they're back on their feet.

387
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,560
Life's back to how it was,

388
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,080
and things are going well.

389
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,560
Exactly.

390
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,240
Right?

391
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,159
I'm telling you,

392
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,840
life will only get better.

393
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,560
Yeah,

394
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,360
keep it up.

395
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,399
And turn things around.

396
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,440
How's it?

397
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,039
Not good.

398
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,799
I mean it.

399
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,200
Why not?

400
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,360
When you were little,

401
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,399
your baby food

402
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,200
was made by me.

403
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,560
Look how well you've grown.

404
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,679
Was I eating your baby food

405
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,560
the whole time?

406
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,759
That's all in the past.

407
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,080
Things are different now.

408
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,560
So, how should baby food

409
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,240
be made now?

410
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,039
Here's how we do it now.

411
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,919
First, peel a boiled egg,

412
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,639
then take half the yolk.

413
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,919
Add two spoonfuls of rice cereal,

414
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,999
one spoonful of mashed potatoes,

415
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:58,960
and one spoonful of carrots.

416
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,999
Be careful not to give too much.

417
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Babies have small stomachs,

418
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,440
only as big as a fist.

419
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,840
If you overfeed,

420
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,200
you'll stretch his stomach.

421
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,759
Do you want my little brother

422
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,639
to become chubby?

423
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,679
Where did you

424
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,799
learn all this?

425
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,240
We've been doing this

426
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,360
since you weren't around.

427
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,759
So, what else

428
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,519
have you learned

429
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,360
while I wasn't here?

430
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,159
Oh, so much more!

431
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,720
It must have been tough on you

432
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,999
while I was away.

433
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,240
The pressure to learn was intense.

434
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,879
Alright,

435
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,759
since I'm back now,

436
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,360
leave all this

437
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,399
to me.

438
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,840
You just focus on your homework.

439
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,080
I've finished my homework,

440
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,440
so, I'm free to supervise you now.

441
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,919
Have I fallen so low at home

442
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,799
that I need you

443
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,480
to supervise me?

444
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,240
Inspection.

445
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:37,919
Inspection.

446
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,840
Inspection?

447
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,560
It's called

448
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:41,679
-appreciation.
-Appreciation.

449
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,759
Right, appreciation.

450
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,799
Is that okay?

451
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,600
You're still mixing that cereal?

452
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,639
I've wasted my words.

453
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,039
Do it the way I told you.

454
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,039
You're still supervising!

455
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,279
How should it be done? Repeat it.

456
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,080
First, peel a boiled egg.

457
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,639
Half the yolk, two spoons of rice cereal,

458
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,519
one spoonful of mashed potatoes...

459
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,320
How many eggs?

460
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,360
One egg.

461
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,560
Then...

462
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,879
Then,

463
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,240
half the yolk.

464
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,759
Two spoonfuls

465
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,399
of rice cereal.

466
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,519
One spoonful of mashed potatoes,

467
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,399
one spoonful of carrots.

468
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:12,999
See?

469
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,159
Did you really think I wouldn't get it?

470
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,639
Your dad's a top student!

471
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,560
You're still trustworthy,

472
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,440
Comrade Li.

473
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,279
Let's begin.

474
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,480
I get you.

475
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
Why didn't you sign?

476
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,200
Do you want me to sign

477
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,600
or not?

478
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,120
I just want to ask.

479
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,560
He said he wanted to team up,

480
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,440
but I'm not considering it.

481
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,399
I don't want to form a fake duo

482
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,600
just to earn money from fans.

483
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,080
Besides,

484
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,199
you're my only partner,

485
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,879
just you, my husband.

486
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,959
You're the only one in my heart,

487
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,520
not her.

488
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,120
You have to believe

489
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,679
that my feelings are real.

490
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:21,760
Honey,

491
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:22,919
come here.

492
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,360
What for?

493
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,360
Come on.

494
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,639
Is it our wedding anniversary?

495
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,159
No.

496
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,199
It could be.

497
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:38,399
Come on,

498
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the kids are asleep.

499
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,280
A rare opportunity

500
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,639
for just the two of us

501
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,479
to watch a movie,

502
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:48,280
have a drink,

503
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,120
and relax.

504
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,959
Movie?

505
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,919
Didn't you see me

506
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:53,879
going through documents over there?

507
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,360
What documents?

508
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,199
About Mengxin?

509
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,560
Didn't you arrange to meet tomorrow?

510
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,760
Not about Xin.

511
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,520
Yu Hai.

512
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,719
Yu Hai?

513
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:03,360
He's asking you to work?

514
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,600
He wishes!

515
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,159
He even wants me

516
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,600
to be the content director

517
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,399
for the entire Blue Ocean.

518
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,360
Did you agree?

519
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,120
No.

520
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,399
So, are you discussing it

521
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:13,199
with me now?

522
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,399
Not really.

523
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,360
It seems my standing in this family

524
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:18,280
is rather precarious.

525
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,320
No, you've already

526
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,760
reclaimed the power at home.

527
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,760
But I just don't think this is

528
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,320
something that needs your input.

529
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,280
Given our situation, it's not feasible.

530
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,919
You're in Beijing right now.

531
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,800
If I take this job,

532
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,360
what will happen to the kids?

533
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
Won't this family fall apart?

534
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,840
But if our family conditions

535
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,479
allowed it?

536
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Even if they did, I wouldn't go.

537
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,159
Why not?

538
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,560
You have no idea.

539
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,120
Blue Ocean's situation is now complicated.

540
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,479
When he acquired Xinmiao,

541
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,239
he agreed to a capital bet.

542
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,479
But he failed,

543
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,600
and now they're restructuring.

544
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,600
If they can't fix it this time,

545
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,199
Yu Hai will be kicked out.

546
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,320
So why should I go?

547
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:57,360
Work there for a couple of months,

548
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,239
then pack up and leave?

549
00:19:58,639 --> 00:19:59,760
It's not worth it.

550
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,159
Yeah.

551
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,479
Besides,

552
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,800
I'm not Huang Sisi.

553
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,719
I can't do things she did.

554
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,439
Huang Sisi was never

555
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,280
that capable anyway, right?

556
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,600
You're capable,

557
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,679
but you don't have the energy.

558
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,159
Can I help?

559
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,959
How can I help?

560
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,439
Blue Ocean doesn't seem

561
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,120
to have a healthcare division, does it?

562
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
It's Yu Hai's fault.

563
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:25,320
After all this time,

564
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,120
his business expansion skills

565
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,679
are still lacking.

566
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,199
Exactly!

567
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,360
My husband's vision is much better,

568
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:29,919
right?

569
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,320
Let's not talk about this anymore.

570
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,159
Right now,

571
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,080
let's switch to another world.

572
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,399
We can't.

573
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,800
No,

574
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,679
listen.

575
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,679
Yu Hai has already come to me.

576
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,520
At least we're still old classmates,

577
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,399
right?

578
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,280
I've got to

579
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,520
come up with a plan for him,

580
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,000
so, he can manage for a couple of months

581
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,600
until he finds a content director

582
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,959
or something.

583
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,439
Right?

584
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,159
No, we're not

585
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,239
in that much of a rush.

586
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:53,879
Even if you want to,

587
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,239
you can do it

588
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:55,919
after watching the movie while drinking.

589
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,239
But it's getting late.

590
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,159
They're waiting for a lifeline.

591
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,360
You're saving him,

592
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,199
but what about my feelings?

593
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,679
Shouldn't you take care of them too?

594
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,399
Alright, alright. 

595
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,280
Give it a swirl.

596
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,919
Give it a swirl.

597
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,120
Give it a swirl.

598
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,000
Give it a swirl.

599
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,280
Okay, fine.

600
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,040
You can watch on your own.

601
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,800
Okay.

602
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:15,959
You go ahead and watch.

603
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:16,479
Well...

604
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,120
From what I've learned

605
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,719
over the past few days,

606
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:07,919
the all-in-one

607
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,760
diapers are still

608
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,560
the best.

609
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:11,800
Do you know why?

610
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,360
Because they're

611
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,399
comfortable and breathable.

612
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,439
Li Lin.

613
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm telling you,

614
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,879
those are not environmentally friendly.

615
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,000
Why not?

616
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,040
I've been using them,

617
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,280
and I've found them very effective.

618
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,840
Are you done

619
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,719
yet?

620
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:24,159
You've been

621
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,800
talking about a lousy diaper for ages.

622
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,280
Hurry back home and help your wife.

623
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,080
Come back from Beijing.

624
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
How is she going to take care of two kids?

625
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:30,520
You'll call her

626
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,600
to change diapers?

627
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:32,639
I want to come back,

628
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:33,199
don't I?

629
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
I'm

630
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,760
working on it.

631
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:36,919
Yeah.

632
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,120
Let me tell you something, Haowen.

633
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:40,600
Go ahead.

634
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,320
Just don't tell anyone else.

635
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,239
Who would I tell?

636
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,560
Come to see your brother.

637
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,840
But I still can't tell you,

638
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,879
you big mouth.

639
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:48,760
If you know,

640
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,719
everyone will know.

641
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,239
You're so chatty. This intellectual type

642
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,719
is really hard to deal with.

643
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,320
Right?

644
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,879
How's Xin's

645
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,080
live stream going?

646
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,320
I'm not telling you either.

647
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:57,879
Why not

648
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:58,679
tell me about it?

649
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,679
You're not telling me,

650
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,239
so, you go first.

651
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,879
You go first.

652
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,679
You go first.

653
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,919
Let me tell you,

654
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,080
we're doing great now.

655
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,040
We're back to the old storage unit,

656
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
doing some small business.

657
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,000
It's tough,

658
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,000
but we're making money

659
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,719
and feeling secure about it.

660
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,399
We're in the honeymoon phase again.

661
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,560
Great, great, great!

662
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,120
I can tell from your spirits

663
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,679
that things are really good.

664
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,399
That's great.

665
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,080
You two aren't planning for

666
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,840
a third child, are you?

667
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,320
Well, you guess.

668
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,320
Is this something I should guess?

669
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,679
Yes.

670
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,239
You have to make it happen yourself,

671
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:26,760
right?

672
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,399
We're having a little brother.

673
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,120
Pacifier.

674
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,439
Pacifier. You can't keep sucking on it.

675
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,760
After two years old,

676
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,000
you can't use it anymore,

677
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,719
because it affects

678
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,879
the growth of teeth and gums.

679
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:38,199
You've been doing this live streaming

680
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:38,959
for over half a year now.

681
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,040
How's it going?

682
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,000
Pretty good.

683
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:44,399
It's tiring,

684
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,919
but it feels secure.

685
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,080
Look,

686
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,399
Haowen and I are doing everything together.

687
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,560
Selecting products, shipping,

688
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,600
restocking, live streaming.

689
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,719
It feels like we're back to

690
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,080
the early days of starting our business.

691
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,600
That's good enough.

692
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,679
Your brother-in-law is still in Beijing.

693
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,080
With my brother-in-law gone,

694
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,879
you must feel lonely, right?

695
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,040
Bored, right?

696
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,360
Frustrated, right?

697
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:08,280
Come on,

698
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:09,639
join us.

699
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,959
Can't do it.

700
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:12,479
Live streaming really isn't for me.

701
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm not asking you to live stream.

702
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,280
Asking you to be a partner.

703
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,760
That's even worse.

704
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:17,760
I'm just not cut out

705
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,840
to be a boss.

706
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:22,919
Didn't you want to sign with a company?

707
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,479
A company approached me,

708
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,439
but I wasn't interested.

709
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,280
Think about it.

710
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,679
Once you sign with a company,

711
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,239
the control is all in their hands.

712
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,120
I'd be working for someone else,

713
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
sharing the profits.

714
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
What's in it for me?

715
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,959
What Haowen and I have going now is great.

716
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,159
The only thing is,

717
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,360
we lack some professional expertise.

718
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,479
So, I'm thinking of

719
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,800
finding someone

720
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
to guide and plan things.

721
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,000
That's why I'm asking you.

722
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,159
But I'm not professional enough.

723
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,800
Aren't you in new media?

724
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,399
Between you and me,

725
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,479
new media and live streaming sales

726
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:52,360
are two different things.

727
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,760
Don't go embarrassing myself out there.

728
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,120
So, you just don't want to help me.

729
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,199
Yes,

730
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:58,679
I don't want to.

731
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,360
So, I find someone else.

732
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:02,919
Else...

733
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,120
Who?

734
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:05,879
Who can help me?

735
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,679
A former subordinate of mine

736
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,320
named Xia Xiaohe.

737
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,360
She's a good kid,

738
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
and most importantly, she's hardworking.

739
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,320
She's been

740
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,719
working for a big streamer

741
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,399
for over a year,

742
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,199
doing operations.

743
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,840
I talked to her,

744
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,399
and she's willing to come help you.

745
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,800
She thinks starting from scratch

746
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,600
might give her more room for growth.

747
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:29,840
I knew you wouldn't leave me hanging.

748
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,439
Doing good deeds

749
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,239
without leaving your name, huh?

750
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,959
Here she is, He!

751
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,080
Hello, Meng'an.

752
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,520
Hello.

753
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:40,919
Hello, hello!

754
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,199
You must be Hot Mom, right?

755
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,439
Yes, yes.

756
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,080
Xu Mengxin, my sister.

757
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,080
Hello, hello.

758
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,600
Hello.

759
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:50,320
So, what do you think? Any ideas?

760
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,080
I reviewed Hot Mom's

761
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,679
account.

762
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,159
I think

763
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,000
your persona

764
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,840
needs to be more defined.

765
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,560
Based on current market trends

766
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,479
and your personal vibe,

767
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,679
I've crafted a persona

768
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
of a bankrupt noblewoman for you.

769
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,080
It can showcase

770
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
your excellent taste.

771
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,800
And at the same time,

772
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,439
it can bring you closer to your audience.

773
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,199
Bankrupt noblewoman?

774
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:13,239
That's good.

775
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,639
Better than Hot Mom.

776
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:15,439
No.

777
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,399
Wait a second...

778
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:19,399
Is it good?

779
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,760
It's great!

780
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:22,479
Simple, eye-catching.

781
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:23,560
And it fits

782
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,679
my current situation perfectly.

783
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,919
Maybe we shouldn't

784
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,439
mention the past.

785
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,399
While it fits,

786
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,439
you should also think about Haowen.

787
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,320
Bankrupt?

788
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,280
What's wrong with being bankrupt?

789
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,719
It's true, we are bankrupt.

790
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,600
He's still buying

791
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,639
on credit.

792
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,040
I make the decisions on this.

793
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,080
It's settled.

794
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,919
Starting tomorrow,

795
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,879
I'm the Bankrupt Noblewoman.

796
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,879
And you're the noblewoman's sister.

797
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,840
Fine.

798
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,399
This face mask

799
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:53,800
isn't from a middleman channel.

800
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,840
It's not from a department store either,

801
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,520
but directly from the factory.

802
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,280
Guaranteed the lowest price online.

803
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,399
Those who are interested

804
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:01,120
can check out the first link.

805
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,239
This face mask

806
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,159
is

807
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,080
gentle

808
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,560
and non-irritating.

809
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,919
I used it

810
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:07,560
while breastfeeding.

811
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,639
Now my sister

812
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:09,520
is pregnant,

813
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,080
and she can use it too.

814
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,360
Try this.

815
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,280
What's this?

816
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,479
A prop.

817
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,320
A scapegoat.

818
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,959
What's the scapegoat for?

819
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,159
To give the audience a hook.

820
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,120
Remember.

821
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,639
It's your turn.

822
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:20,959
Link one is for this face mask.

823
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,679
Next, we're moving on to link two.

824
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:23,199
It's

825
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,199
a lipstick set

826
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:27,159
brought by my husband.

827
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,439
I mentioned this lipstick gift box

828
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,239
to everyone earlier.

829
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,479
This is going well.

830
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:31,840
How's it going?

831
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,959
How many face masks have sold?

832
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,000
A lot already.

833
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,959
Much higher than the past few days.

834
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:37,959
The two of them sitting together

835
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:38,639
works really well.

836
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:39,679
It's especially good.

837
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,399
Dear audience...

838
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,040
Press your lips together.

839
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,879
How does it look?

840
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,159
Makes your teeth look whiter.

841
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,719
Does it look good?

842
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,399
Everyone, hurry and click the link!

843
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,479
Shade 416, Rotten Tomato,

844
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,360
on link two.

845
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,120
Link two,

846
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,199
shade 416, Rotten Tomato.

847
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,760
This office

848
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,080
has a great view

849
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,360
and excellent lighting.

850
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,560
That's why I reserved it

851
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,360
especially for you.

852
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,199
Thank you.

853
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,320
Are you heading out on a trip?

854
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:23,959
Yes,

855
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,639
I'm off to the airport

856
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,639
to interview

857
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,439
a few content directors.

858
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:30,120
See if there are any suitable candidates.

859
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,159
What about Meng'an?

860
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,239
Did you ask her?

861
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,919
She was the first one I approached.

862
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:34,719
She told me that

863
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,600
with her child being so young,

864
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,479
she just doesn't have the energy.

865
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
I can understand that.

866
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,239
Besides,

867
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,760
given Blue Ocean's current situation,

868
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,840
it's not right

869
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,120
to drag her into this.

870
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,639
Wanzhen,

871
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:51,560
I have to thank you

872
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,399
for standing by me in this way.

873
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,639
Otherwise,

874
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,120
those investors would've

875
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,040
kicked me

876
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,159
out of Blue Ocean by now.

877
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm just trusting my investment instincts.

878
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,800
I didn't expect

879
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,919
that you'd still...

880
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,719
But if I lose this bet,

881
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,360
what about your career?

882
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,719
This is only temporary.

883
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:20,879
Once Blue Ocean gets back on track,

884
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:22,600
I'll return to the investment field.

885
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,000
As long as you follow the new plan

886
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,280
and meet the performance goals,

887
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
it'll benefit both of us.

888
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,159
But I heard from Mr Zhou

889
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
that if this project fails,

890
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,719
your career

891
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,639
is over too.

892
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,399
Don't listen to him.

893
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:38,399
It's not that dramatic.

894
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,520
Wanzhen,

895
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,800
for Blue Ocean,

896
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,000
I lost you

897
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,080
for

898
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:50,719
ten years.

899
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,199
But rest assured,

900
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,040
this time, even if it costs me everything,

901
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,320
I won't let you down again.

902
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,159
Of course,

903
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,040
if

904
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,840
both of us screw this up,

905
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,280
then we'll sell the house

906
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,360
in the suburbs

907
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:11,959
and go home

908
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,080
to have triplets.

909
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,879
Stop it.

910
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,719
Go catch your flight.

911
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,320
Wait for me.

912
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,280
Why are you going to Blue Ocean?

913
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,439
Blue Ocean

914
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,760
is an investment of Yaohui Co.

915
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,479
I'm going as a shareholder representative,

916
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,040
just a normal reassignment.

917
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,320
I don't understand your investment stuff,

918
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,080
but I know

919
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
you must have the right to refuse.

920
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,120
Tell me the truth.

921
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,080
I can't let it go.

922
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,239
Over these ten years,

923
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,040
Yu Hai built Blue Ocean,

924
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,360
sacrificing his family

925
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,199
and dedicating himself fully to his work.

926
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,320
As his ex-wife,

927
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,760
I hate him.

928
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:31,639
But

929
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,679
from an investor's perspective,

930
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,679
I still admire him.

931
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,959
It's not just Yu Hai as a person,

932
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,840
but also the years

933
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,919
of hard work he's put in.

934
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,439
It's worth cherishing.

935
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,360
Entrepreneurship, hard work,

936
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,879
and effort are inevitable,

937
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,959
but this reason

938
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,120
doesn't convince me.

939
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,239
Don't be fooled

940
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,199
by Yu Hai's usual lightheartedness.

941
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,560
Deep down,

942
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,840
he's still

943
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,080
a very proud person.

944
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,360
I once tried

945
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,760
to break that pride,

946
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,000
but now

947
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,280
I have to protect him.

948
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,959
Because he was once

949
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,120
someone important

950
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,239
to me and my child.

951
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,360
If he fails this time,

952
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,439
I'm afraid

953
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,320
he'll never come

954
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,280
to see me or our child again.

955
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:25,520
But you don't have to

956
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
gamble your career

957
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,919
on this.

958
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm not gambling,

959
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,120
which is why I came to you.

960
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,959
I just want to

961
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,919
buy Yu Hai

962
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,159
more time in this way.

963
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,760
You managed Xinmiao from the start,

964
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,760
and you're familiar with Blue Ocean.

965
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,719
After all,

966
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,120
you've been rivals for years.

967
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,800
You must understand it well.

968
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
If you become the content director

969
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
at Blue Ocean,

970
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,080
we will definitely win.

971
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,360
Nothing is absolute.

972
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:02,679
And Yu Hai should have

973
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,040
told you about my situation.

974
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:06,639
I know,

975
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,080
but we can't

976
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,600
be housewives forever.

977
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm a living example.

978
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,199
This is actually

979
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,320
a good opportunity for you

980
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,080
to return to the workforce.

981
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,080
You don't have to answer right away.

982
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,879
Give yourself some time

983
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,280
to think it over.

984
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,639
After all,

985
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:27,600
this isn't something

986
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,679
you can decide on your own.

987
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,040
Still not asleep so late?

988
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,480
Hubby.

989
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,480
Even if you're helping out,

990
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,080
you don't need to stay up all night.

991
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,319
It's past midnight.

992
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,480
There's no need for this.

993
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,719
Not really.

994
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,480
I just couldn't sleep.

995
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,400
I met with Wanzhen yesterday.

996
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
She told me something,

997
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,359
and I think she and Yu Hai

998
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,120
are really having a tough time.

999
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:09,319
She and Yu Hai?

1000
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,000
What?

1001
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,359
Did they remarry?

1002
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,159
No,

1003
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,040
but they're tied together now.

1004
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,359
What do you mean by tied together?

1005
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,920
Wanzhen is now

1006
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
Yu Hai's investor.

1007
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:21,520
If Blue Ocean fails to meet

1008
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,000
its performance targets in this bet,

1009
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,279
Wanzhen's career

1010
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:25,719
will be over too.

1011
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,799
So, don't you think

1012
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:28,199
I should really help them out?

1013
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,159
Yes,

1014
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,480
of course, they need help.

1015
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,359
What's your plan?

1016
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,600
I actually came up

1017
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,880
with a content execution plan

1018
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,120
for Blue Ocean.

1019
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,920
But after all,

1020
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,960
I'm not in the position

1021
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,120
to say much.

1022
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,679
I'm just thinking of

1023
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,880
giving them this plan

1024
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,159
and letting them

1025
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:50,960
evaluate

1026
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,600
and choose

1027
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,960
on their own.

1028
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
What if you were in the position?

1029
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,159
If I were in that position?

1030
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,880
I'd execute it with full force.

1031
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,679
I can't guarantee

1032
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,839
that my plan would

1033
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:06,679
double Blue Ocean's performance,

1034
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,319
but it will definitely

1035
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:08,359
meet the targets.

1036
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,080
Are you 100% sure?

1037
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,319
I can't say 100%,

1038
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,319
but 80% for sure.

1039
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,120
So, what if

1040
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,040
I stay home to take care of things,

1041
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,880
and you go execute the plan?

1042
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,560
You're not lying to me again, are you?

1043
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,279
You didn't come back

1044
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:32,359
for a vacation

1045
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,679
you're unemployed again, right?

1046
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,279
How could you, Li Lin?

1047
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,359
Are we still a couple?

1048
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,000
Can't you be honest?

1049
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,520
So, what if you're unemployed?

1050
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
It's not like it hasn't happened before.

1051
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,120
Do you think I'd ever despise you?

1052
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,319
You...

1053
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,000
You're still laughing?

1054
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,159
What's so funny about this?

1055
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,600
We're talking about unemployment.

1056
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,440
Yeah,

1057
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,279
not funny at all.

1058
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,359
Alright, I'll be honest with you.

1059
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,000
No. I should hold on for a few more days.

1060
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,679
Holding on for a few more days?

1061
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,880
Then your hair will turn white,

1062
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
and we'll run out of food at home.

1063
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,719
Do you know that?

1064
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,520
You're the pillar of this family

1065
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,199
now.

1066
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,799
Is hair really that easy to turn white?

1067
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,120
I'll hold back.

1068
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,600
Don't worry.

1069
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm officially telling you now.

1070
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,199
I've been reassigned back here.

1071
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,759
Li Lin.

1072
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:46,520
I have more good news.

1073
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,239
Want to hear it?

1074
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,679
More good news?

1075
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:49,839
What is it?

1076
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,759
Letting me go home

1077
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:52,920
for a break?

1078
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,319
You're thinking too small.

1079
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,359
Mr Ma's lab

1080
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,600
is preparing for an upgrade,

1081
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,319
and he needs you.

1082
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,279
Excited?

1083
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:06,960
Excited?

1084
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,080
Excited my foot!

1085
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1086
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,440
Do you know how conflicted

1087
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,880
I've been during this time?

1088
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
I've been dreading the thought that

1089
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,159
one phone call would take you away again.

1090
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Do you think it's been easy for me?

1091
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,120
It's been really hard.

1092
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,319
I've seen it.

1093
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,759
I just wanted to

1094
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,040
tease you a bit.

1095
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,960
I don't want to be teased anymore.

1096
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,920
Alright, alright,

1097
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,679
I won't tease you anymore.

1098
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,799
But I'm telling the truth.

1099
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,520
Excited?

1100
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,319
Yeah, a little.

1101
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm back.

1102
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,799
Honey,

1103
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,440
you have to go.

1104
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:53,839
Let's not talk about

1105
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,319
whether to help a friend or not.

1106
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,839
But I think you should go out

1107
00:38:58,319 --> 00:38:59,319
and pursue your career.

1108
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,920
You've helped me succeed once;

1109
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,199
now I want to help you succeed.

1110
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,000
I don't understand

1111
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,319
your field,

1112
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,199
but I know my wife.

1113
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,000
Home isn't

1114
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,279
your stage;

1115
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:15,960
the outside world

1116
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,679
is where you belong.

1117
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,799
It's not as easy as you make it sound.

1118
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,759
Taking on a task in a crisis isn't easy.

1119
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,960
What if I mess it up?

1120
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:30,000
We'll do our best.

1121
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,159
Even if it doesn't work out,

1122
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,000
there'll be no regrets.

1123
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,759
At least we'll have been true

1124
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,480
to ourselves and to our friends.

1125
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,920
I'll go make the milk.

1126
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,839
I'll hold the baby.

1127
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:32,159
Some say

1128
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,000
that women in their forties

1129
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,880
have natural advantages in the workplace.

1130
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:38,000
They

1131
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,120
know their direction,

1132
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:41,920
understand the rules,

1133
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:43,719
have experience,

1134
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,359
and know their limits.

1135
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,920
Others say

1136
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,159
that as we age,

1137
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,520
our life's entanglements increase,

1138
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,679
making it harder

1139
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,839
to achieve significant success.

1140
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,759
I want to say,

1141
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,600
you're all right.

1142
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,639
Because

1143
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,319
I've experienced all of this.

1144
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,839
In fact,

1145
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,480
I'm still going through it.

1146
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,359
You're unemployed now,

1147
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,880
and I'm at home awaiting childbirth.

1148
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,639
What will we eat

1149
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,440
and drink?

1150
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,679
Middle age

1151
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,279
is indeed tough.

1152
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:17,839
It's hard for us to make big changes

1153
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,120
to our work and life.

1154
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,359
Because we have aging parents

1155
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,400
and young children to care for.

1156
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,199
Then we'll have the baby.

1157
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,799
Mommy, I love you!

1158
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,159
But

1159
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,799
we still have

1160
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:33,799
a passionate heart,

1161
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,719
wanting to

1162
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
live a better life.

1163
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,880
Keep going! Keep going!

1164
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,400
Believe in us,

1165
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,000
the backbone of society.

1166
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,319
And believe in yourself.

1167
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,040
We have the support of our families.

1168
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,239
Take this.

1169
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,520
Why are you back so late?

1170
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,040
You're not asleep?

1171
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,839
What do you want to eat?

1172
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,080
There's everything in the fridge.

1173
00:41:58,279 --> 00:41:59,159
Small wontons.

1174
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:00,600
I will make them.

1175
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,719
Then this house should include

1176
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,080
your share too. This is your home.

1177
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,440
You can live here

1178
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,199
without any hesitation.

1179
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,719
Come on, let's go home.

1180
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,480
No matter what,

1181
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,239
we'll always be family.

1182
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,799
The light at home

1183
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,400
will always be on for you.

1184
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:23,839
And with the help of friends.

1185
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:25,839
Come to Blue Ocean.

1186
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,600
You're just having a baby, right?

1187
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:28,719
It's just a hundred days or so.

1188
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:30,520
I, Yu Hai, can wait.

1189
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,920
Are you really this loyal?

1190
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:33,040
Chen Wanzhen.

1191
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,159
Congratulations.

1192
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,159
You're hired.

1193
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,279
Thank you, Mr Zhou.

1194
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:41,000
They may be our weakness,

1195
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,719
but they are also our armor.

1196
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,319
I'm so scared.

1197
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,359
It's okay, don't be afraid.

1198
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,239
Go ahead and give birth.

1199
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,040
Don't be scared.

1200
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,600
Dad's here.

1201
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:54,560
Mom,

1202
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,359
this is for you.

1203
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Thank you for raising me.

1204
00:42:58,199 --> 00:42:59,639
Thank you, my daughter.

1205
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,359
Though I have to give it my all this time,

1206
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,080
I won't let you down again.

1207
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:04,440
I'm your wife.

1208
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,600
We'll repay all the debt together.

1209
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,480
We are in this together.

1210
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,080
Of course.

1211
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,120
So,

1212
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:14,880
we must use this passionate heart

1213
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,679
to overcome all difficulties

1214
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,359
and embrace

1215
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:20,759
each coming day.

1216
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:23,440
For us,

1217
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,199
everything is

1218
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,279
just in time.
