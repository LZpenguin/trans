Just in Time EP27

3
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,119
We started work in the same year,

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,680
as if we were standing

5
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,000
on the same starting line.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,199
When the starting pistol shot,

7
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:55,920
everyone started

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,119
a long-running race.

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,799
The financial industry

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,240
needs us to keep high intensity,

11
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,640
which is so tiring.

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
We could bear it in our twenties,

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,879
but 35-year-old is a hurdle,

14
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,680
when many people

15
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,320
can't bear the intensity

16
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,399
with their passion wearing away.

17
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,520
So, they leave and change the industry.

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
As for me,

19
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,840
I have been buried myself

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
in endless running.

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,239
As a result,

22
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,879
looking back,

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,199
I have fewer partners left.

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,959
And I quit in the middle of the race.

25
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:25,959
You didn't quit

26
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,760
because of the enthusiasm

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,679
wearing away,

28
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,679
but you were having

29
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,400
long halftime.

30
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,520
Your race was interrupted

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,400
artificially through

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,959
marriage and child-rearing.

33
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,520
So, your passion for the profession

34
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,599
does not wear away,

35
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,480
but becomes stronger

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,319
as you left.

37
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,279
Do you think I make sense?

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes.

39
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,319
I'm now indeed passionate.

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,480
I think every day now

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,440
is a lucky day.

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,199
I don't feel toilsome,

43
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,160
nor do I feel tired.

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,679
The boss likes employees

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,399
who don't feel toilsome

46
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,720
or tired, as you are.

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,160
Come on!

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,879
Earn more money, and run forward!

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,640
Wish I could catch up with you!

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,280
Of course, you can.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,759
Maybe one day,

52
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,839
you'll be my boss.

53
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,039
How come?

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,479
You are my boss.

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,280
I'll do anything

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,160
at your commands.

57
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,479
Brilliant! We work together again!

58
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,520
I can recall

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,759
when we were

60
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,160
working for the same boss,

61
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,319
you were always on top of me.

62
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,119
The past has gone.

63
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,000
Stop mentioning it!

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,920
I insist.

65
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,599
You are the only one

66
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,319
I can mention the story.

67
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:22,879
Okay, go on.

68
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,959
I'll never mention it to anyone else.

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,440
Every athlete

70
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,800
has one's competitor.

71
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,440
And you're my competitor.

72
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,200
I could win everyone in the company,

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,399
except for you.

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,759
No wonder when I resigned,

75
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,679
you gave me

76
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:38,119
a luxury bag.

77
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,759
It was not a big deal.

78
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,720
Let me tell you a secret.

79
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,679
When I heard you resigned,

80
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,399
I breathed a sigh of relief

81
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,160
in my heart.

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,520
I know I was very low back then.

83
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
I felt so relieved

84
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,880
that I'd like to celebrate.

85
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,040
Let alone the bag,

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,480
I wanted to buy you any luxury!

87
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,600
Luckily, I am a man.

88
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,239
My career won't be affected

89
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:01,999
by marriage,

90
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,159
or child-rearing.

91
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,920
Since then,

92
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:04,999
I've gone through

93
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,080
promotion,

94
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,880
and entrepreneurship

95
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,600
in a smooth way.

96
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,119
I myself know clearly

97
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,399
the beginning of my success

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,040
originates from your resignation.

99
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:18,760
I see,

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,800
so I was the devil haunting you.

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,320
I...

102
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,279
am not anymore.

103
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,040
I've left for seven years.

104
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,600
I can never become

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,719
anyone's devil anymore.

106
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:29,640
Wanzhen,

107
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,399
don't repeat

108
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,999
the halftime endlessly.

109
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,719
Most of the working women

110
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:37,119
are too modest

111
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,880
but lack of confidence.

112
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,159
You must have great confidence

113
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,959
to be a professional investor.

114
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,999
Only with great confidence

115
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,999
can you determinedly

116
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,119
trust your judgment.

117
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,959
Seven years is not long.

118
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,360
Every step in life counts.

119
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,520
I am sure

120
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,959
you will remake achievements

121
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,320
in the investment industry,

122
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,880
and even better.

123
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,800
Can I?

124
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,159
Of course, you can.

125
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,920
Thanks for your inspiration.

126
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,679
You know what?

127
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,439
Your encouragement

128
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,119
is more precious than gold.

129
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,279
Okay.

130
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,040
I'll encourage you every day.

131
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:18,480
An,

132
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,320
what should I do?

133
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,920
I didn't mean to be unreasonable,

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,800
but I don't know

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,999
what to do now.

136
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,159
Your dad fell down

137
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,480
on the treadmill

138
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,320
accidentally,

139
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,719
so, he refuses rehabilitation training,

140
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,920
nor does he eat anything!

141
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,760
I criticized him a little bit,

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,679
and he threw his temper at me,

143
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,480
and spoke demoralizing words,

144
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,080
like,

145
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,360
his lifetime

146
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,480
will end these days!

147
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,320
My dad is ill.

148
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,040
It is inevitable

149
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,999
to lose his temper.

150
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,760
I hope you can tolerate him.

151
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:02,760
Think about it.

152
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,399
How well did he treat you before?

153
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,240
Right?

154
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,399
Yeah.

155
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,039
I know. I understand him.

156
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm afraid he said it

157
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,959
because he'll be

158
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,159
my burden

159
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,520
without looking after me.

160
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,200
Since I married your dad,

161
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,520
your dad

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,880
hasn't allowed me to do housework.

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,039
I've been enjoying life

164
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,399
for decades,

165
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,799
and I can do nothing!

166
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,719
Seriously ill as he is,

167
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:35,520
how can I leave him alone?

168
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,919
How about learning

169
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,200
from scratch?

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,799
I can learn everything.

171
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,880
Although sometimes,

172
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,279
I may forget something,

173
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,880
but,

174
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,159
I've tried my best!

175
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,520
I know you have.

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,159
He can't

177
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,080
treat me like that!

178
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,880
If he's seeking death,

179
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,159
what should we do?

180
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,640
I'm sorry to hear that.

181
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,640
So sorry!

182
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,200
There, there.

183
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Don't cry!

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,880
Be good.

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,959
I'll try to persuade him.

186
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,240
There, there.

187
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:12,719
Don't cry.

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,760
We still need to keep our elegance,

189
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,919
right?

190
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,640
You heard that,

191
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,599
didn't you?

192
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
I know you're awake.

193
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,279
What are you thinking about?

194
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,479
Are you eating

195
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,120
nothing today,

196
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,359
or nothing forever?

197
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,200
If you choose the latter,

198
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,599
I'll prepare for the funeral

199
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,760
for you.

200
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
Why are you staring at me?

201
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm telling the truth!

202
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,599
Your wife

203
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,359
is crying

204
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,959
sadly outside,

205
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,680
and it's not my fault.

206
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,839
Shouldn't you take the duty

207
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,919
for indulging her?

208
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,440
You take care of it!

209
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,799
If you abandon all of us,

210
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,760
she

211
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,640
may also leave us with you.

212
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,520
Eat!

213
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,080
Eat?

214
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,000
No death!

215
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,599
If no eat,

216
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
our paths may end together.

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,760
Then eat now.

218
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Come on.

219
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,640
Let's eat!

220
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,440
Bad girl!

221
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,680
Bad guy!

222
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:53,200
So exhausted!

223
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,159
What is a straight-A student?

224
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,680
A straight-A student

225
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,479
would review

226
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,640
for several times.

227
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,440
You're bound to forget

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,039
by learning once in class.

229
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,919
If the foundation

230
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,039
is unstable,

231
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,120
one can never draw inferences.

232
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,880
Students are working too hard

233
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,120
to have time to play.

234
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,000
If you let him

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,719
only think about

236
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,080
drills and exams,

237
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,039
he can't be happy.

238
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,320
Do you really believe

239
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
happy childhood is of playing?

240
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,839
Let me tell you.

241
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,000
Children

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,600
like it

243
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,880
to be disciplined by parents,

244
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,199
as long as it's

245
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,520
in a proper way.

246
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Children

247
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,840
desire for their parents' support,

248
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,360
so that

249
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,760
they can be a better self.

250
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,319
They came out!

251
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,640
Here!

252
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,399
Dad!

253
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:32,799
Lulu!

254
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,559
Let's go!

255
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,039
Lulu,

256
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,240
you must be tired.

257
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,199
How's study today?

258
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,079
Pretty good.

259
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,760
Pretty good.

260
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,640
We're leaving now. Bye-bye.

261
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
Okay. Goodbye.

262
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,679
Goodbye.

263
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,919
We're here!

264
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,480
Where's your mom?

265
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,039
How's it going?

266
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,039
Is Xin okay?

267
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,159
Pretty good.

268
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,559
The wound heals well.

269
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,439
She didn't answer my phone.

270
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,600
You deserve it!

271
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,480
I wouldn't either if I were her.

272
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,679
Nobody in a bad temper would answer it.

273
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:12,960
Forget it.

274
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,919
Don't overthink.

275
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,240
She's throwing a tantrum.

276
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,760
But the way is different.

277
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,439
Well, who asked you to annoy her?

278
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,120
No.

279
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,480
Stop talking nonsense.

280
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,399
Did I do it deliberately?

281
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,640
She had no choice!

282
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,039
As a mom, you should know it.

283
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,120
She knows everything.

284
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,799
So, how can we

285
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,120
comfort her?

286
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
That's easy.

287
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,600
Give her an out.

288
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
Lower your profile.

289
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,319
That's your strength.

290
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,559
It's tiring to do so, okay?

291
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:48,880
Well,

292
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,520
how are you recently?

293
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,360
Are you doing okay?

294
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,279
Carrying a baby at my age

295
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,120
cannot compare to that in my twenties.

296
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,520
The energy is deficit.

297
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,480
But it's also an edge.

298
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,760
My professional life

299
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,439
has reached its peak.

300
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,679
Without performance,

301
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,559
everyone can understand

302
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,679
that a pregnant woman

303
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,399
can be forgiven.

304
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,439
During the transition,

305
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,360
I feel fine.

306
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,319
It seems that

307
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:14,799
the baby is your excuse.

308
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,679
Pretty good.

309
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,079
Do you want more babies?

310
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,399
How's your relationship

311
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,399
with the young doctor?

312
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,520
You're acting like

313
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,439
a gossip girl!

314
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,439
Well,

315
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,079
it's so normal!

316
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:27,640
I think it's normal

317
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,799
to be gossiping!

318
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,159
Let me tell you.

319
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,840
Have less milk tea

320
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,919
and cakes.

321
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,199
We should put weight management

322
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,159
on the agenda.

323
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,640
We'll welcome our second wind

324
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,120
in a perfect

325
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
posture.

326
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,360
I don't believe

327
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,319
that you're not

328
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:44,799
energetic anymore.

329
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,760
Spill the tea. Come on.

330
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,079
What? No comment.

331
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:49,640
Nothing.

332
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,880
I smell a rat.

333
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,399
No, really!

334
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,439
I'm already disturbed

335
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:56,880
by Yu Hai,

336
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,120
and I don't need another man!

337
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,640
Alright?

338
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,520
Yu...

339
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,240
Does Yu Hai

340
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,120
want to remarry you?

341
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,279
Nice try!

342
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,679
To be honest,

343
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,360
what on earth

344
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,399
do you think of him?

345
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,439
Yu Hai is not a playboy.

346
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,600
Living with him for so many years,

347
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,240
I admit we used to love each other.

348
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,559
After all,

349
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,039
he's the father of two kids.

350
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,079
That relationship

351
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,760
cannot ever be given up.

352
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,760
Most importantly,

353
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,439
I just got into the investment bank,

354
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,640
so, I don't want affairs

355
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,079
to disturb me,

356
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,279
but devote myself to work.

357
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,880
So, he's passed.

358
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:38,960
Any handsome

359
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,120
in the investment bank?

360
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,919
Or,

361
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,279
does anybody like you?

362
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,439
Jesus!

363
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:44,960
Are you the leader of a gossip club?

364
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,079
Yes, I am.

365
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,039
Spill the tea.

366
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,960
What?

367
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,439
Does anybody like you?

368
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,000
Like, the boss, your colleague,

369
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,399
and... your employee!

370
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,880
The boss of the company

371
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,520
is my old colleague.

372
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,120
At work,

373
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,559
he cares about me.

374
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,159
Only at work?

375
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,679
How about at life?

376
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,319
Yes!

377
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:06,279
No!

378
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:06,720
Yes!

379
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,360
No!

380
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,439
He likes joking!

381
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,120
No.

382
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:11,840
We're mature enough.

383
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,520
We know where the bottom line is.

384
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,799
Yu Hai is still your priority.

385
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,399
Let him try even harder!

386
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,439
Could you please stop mentioning him?

387
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,240
Okay, I won't.

388
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,120
I'm pretty worried about you.

389
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,720
If you keep gossiping,

390
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,799
aren't you afraid

391
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,600
your baby

392
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,720
will be like you?

393
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,960
Don't worry.

394
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,399
Li Lin and I

395
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,399
used to have a

396
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,399
much deeper conversation.

397
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
My Gosh!

398
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,279
You beat me.

399
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,039
When

400
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:44,880
Wang Zhe was at home alone,

401
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,439
he would inspire himself

402
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
to rank the first.

403
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,600
He would cry if he ranked second.

404
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Really?

405
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,720
Is he happy to push himself?

406
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,559
I don't think so.

407
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,120
He's annoyed with his mother.

408
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,559
However,

409
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,600
Wang Zhe is an

410
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,760
inborn straight-A student.

411
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,640
He loves drills and study,

412
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,840
with no other hobbies.

413
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,640
I didn't know he was like that.

414
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,679
His mother asked me

415
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,520
to ask your mother

416
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,520
if

417
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,199
it's happy to play or to succeed.

418
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,799
Do you even bother to ask?

419
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,120
Feisty as my mom is,

420
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,840
she loves the happiness of success.

421
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,319
Your mom is not wrong.

422
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,559
It depends on the perspective.

423
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,919
Pursuing success is a positive attitude,

424
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:31,199
while happiness

425
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,840
is an impetus,

426
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,159
a state of mind.

427
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,439
Dad,

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,600
I recall you told me once

429
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,240
when you were young,

430
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,679
you loved doing homework,

431
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,919
just like Wang Zhe did.

432
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,480
Were you happy?

433
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,000
I was happy.

434
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
I was very happy.

435
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,199
When I tackled a difficult problem,

436
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,039
I felt so joyful.

437
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,039
to have a sense of achievement.

438
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,880
And I was craving

439
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,439
for more difficult ones.

440
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,799
Of course,

441
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,039
I think

442
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,720
one is different from another.

443
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:01,799
I won't

444
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,480
request you in my standard.

445
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,319
All I wish is that you are happier

446
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,079
than I was.

447
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
I'm very happy now.

448
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,199
I can hang out with my besties,

449
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,960
travel with you and mom,

450
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,120
eat all kinds of delicious food,

451
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,960
listen to my favorite music,

452
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,760
play the piano, and go to the concert!

453
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,640
But,

454
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,679
there's no chance for me to be

455
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,480
a straight-A student like Wang Zhe.

456
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,960
You don't need to be others.

457
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,079
I don't need you

458
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,360
to be like others.

459
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,840
You just get on your own way,

460
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,559
to grow up

461
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,960
into someone you want to be.

462
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,319
And that's my ideal

463
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,319
daughter.

464
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,799
Why don't you get it straight?

465
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,000
I am an ordinary kid

466
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,799
who is easily distracted,

467
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,439
but not a talent.

468
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,399
No, no.

469
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,199
I'm not laughing at you.

470
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,360
I mean it, seriously.

471
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,559
Knowing your thoughts,

472
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:50,960
I feel so relieved.

473
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,240
It proves that

474
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,799
you have a good mental state.

475
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,679
Healthy mindset.

476
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Anyway,

477
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,880
if you're in,

478
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,399
give it your all,

479
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,559
and study

480
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,120
as hard as you can.

481
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,840
That's how a happy life works.

482
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,240
Understood?

483
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,840
Yes, I do.

484
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,600
My daughter has grown up.

485
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,679
A hint is all that is needed.

486
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,600
I'll try my best!

487
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,319
Yes!

488
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,960
To play as hard as I can!

489
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,319
Haven't I

490
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,039
made it clear?

491
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,360
I'm kidding.

492
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,439
I know what you mean!

493
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,520
Naughty!

494
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,520
Let's eat fried chicken!

495
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,120
Yes!

496
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,079
I'm kidding.

497
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,079
Let's go for fried chicken!

498
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,840
Catch me!

499
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,799
Catch me!

500
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:54,279
Catch me!

501
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,199
Catch the last one!

502
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm coming!

503
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,480
Wanwan.

504
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,559
Mom!

505
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,919
Allow us to play a little longer!

506
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,240
Okay. Go ahead.

507
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,120
Accompany them for a while.

508
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,559
Okay.

509
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,319
Off duty, Ms. Chen?

510
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,079
You're having a good time

511
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,360
with these children!

512
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,399
I'm good at it.

513
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,520
I noticed you put

514
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,799
a male jacket on your balcony.

515
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,079
You saw it?

516
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,520
Your advice is great.

517
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,960
So, I took your good advice.

518
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,919
Let's play together.

519
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,399
Okay.

520
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,319
Play with us!

521
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,079
Alright!

522
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:25,960
Mom will play with you!

523
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,559
Come here.

524
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,520
I also want this!

525
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,120
I want this!

526
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,279
Okay.

527
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,039
The petrol milk.

528
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,079
We are big cars,

529
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,599
so, we should drink petrol milk.

530
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,879
The above is my newly made

531
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:58,639
creative product solution

532
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,760
of our new media.

533
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
The Internet evolves so fast

534
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,960
that the product three months ago

535
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
has been phased out.

536
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:05,480
After reviewing

537
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,639
the plan,

538
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:07,680
you're expected to find

539
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,160
a new direction of products

540
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,440
and dynamic for Xinmiao.

541
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,279
I think highly of the plan

542
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,240
made by Sisi.

543
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,160
Her idea goes along with

544
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,839
the market development needs.

545
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,720
We can put it into practice now.

546
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,200
I used to raise the project

547
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,359
to you before,

548
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,599
but you denied it.

549
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,240
Have you?

550
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,799
Recently,

551
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,400
when you got your house ownership.

552
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,960
Yeah, I recalled it.

553
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,160
The company was in a slump then.

554
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,879
But now it has recovered.

555
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,240
Besides,

556
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,520
how wonderful it is that you two

557
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,799
have the same idea!

558
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,839
Carry it out right away.

559
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,920
About

560
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,960
personnel

561
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,480
and funds,

562
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,319
What's on your mind about this?

563
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,200
Don't worry.

564
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,839
I need no extra help.

565
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,879
I can use the least budget

566
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:59,480
and the lowest personnel cost

567
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,400
to have it done.

568
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,400
If I have to spend a lot

569
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,639
in finishing the task,

570
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:04,760
what are you hiring me for?

571
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,000
Mu,

572
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,799
see the difference?

573
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,879
Let's congratulate the project team

574
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,599
on getting the order of Aiying!

575
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,639
We laid out the mother-and-baby track,

576
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,319
and helped the leader of the industry

577
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,720
expand and consolidate its share,

578
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,680
which is a win-win cooperation!

579
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
Tonight, it's my treat.

580
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,160
All team members will

581
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,000
have a drink!

582
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,319
The person we should

583
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,279
be grateful most

584
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,160
is Wendy.

585
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,440
Wendy, without you,

586
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,000
we wouldn't have reached Mrs. Wei,

587
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,639
nor would we have

588
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,520
signed a contract.

589
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,160
It's my duty.

590
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
I feel so lucky.

591
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,119
Both Mrs. Wei and I

592
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,480
are mothers of two kids,

593
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,799
so, we talk in the same language.

594
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,879
It's not because you're lucky,

595
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:00,119
but it's your strength.

596
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,559
You're not only

597
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,760
a mother of two kids,

598
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,039
but also an excellent

599
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,119
working woman.

600
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
If I have to spend a lot

601
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,240
in finishing the task,

602
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,480
what are you hiring me for?

603
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,119
Is that what she said?

604
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,200
How ambitious she is!

605
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,119
But she also makes sense.

606
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,559
I'm just a little bit angry

607
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,799
because her project

608
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,879
has been mentioned to Mr. Zhang

609
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,279
for many times.

610
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,839
He never accepted it.

611
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,119
When Huang Sisi came,

612
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:42,799
he instantly initiated it.

613
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,119
He explained to me that

614
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,720
since everyone likes it,

615
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,279
it is worth carrying out.

616
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,599
Aren't you angry with it?

617
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,960
You should understand him.

618
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,639
As a new Deputy Director,

619
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:56,960
she's in a weak position.

620
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,000
She's also hired by Mr. Zhang

621
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,639
with a high salary.

622
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:02,160
It's reasonable for him to support her,

623
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,559
or her value won't stand out.

624
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,400
If her value can't stand out,

625
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,160
it means he chose the wrong person,

626
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,839
right?

627
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:10,879
Maybe Mr. Zhang gives her

628
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,839
a chance to show off,

629
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,760
and see if he can help her

630
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,559
make a success.

631
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,359
However,

632
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,240
if he succeeded

633
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,520
in helping her,

634
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,839
you should be aware of your status.

635
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,400
Hello, Directors.

636
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,520
Director Xu,

637
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,200
your express delivery.

638
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,119
I fetched them for you.

639
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,240
It may be inconvenient for you.

640
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,799
Thank you.

641
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,839
Can't you even

642
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,920
carry express deliveries?

643
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,079
That's exaggerated.

644
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,639
Hello,

645
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,160
any date at dinner?

646
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,559
There is a new Mediterranean Restaurant

647
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,760
next to the company.

648
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,879
Do you want to try with me?

649
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,200
No need.

650
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,000
I have a date.

651
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,119
You know?

652
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,119
I'm still single.

653
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,319
I see.

654
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll try my best.

655
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Good figure!

656
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
She looks pretty in the formal dress.

657
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,160
Look at her energy!

658
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,079
If I'm competing for energy

659
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,879
with her,

660
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:20,079
I'm bound to lose.

661
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,000
I have a tip for you.

662
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:25,440
Just say it.

663
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,920
Delegate power.

664
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,440
I agree.

665
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,480
Wise choice!

666
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,000
If she's hard-working,

667
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,240
let her work hard.

668
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,680
We should check out

669
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,760
if she has the ability!

670
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,240
Do you know the information

671
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,680
I lately found out?

672
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,559
Spill the tea!

673
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,879
Not long after she resigned,

674
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,599
the key member of the project group

675
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,720
all resigned

676
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,760
in Blue Ocean,

677
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,639
which is her own team

678
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,960
before she resigned.

679
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,359
Now,

680
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,960
due to the lockout of the timeline,

681
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,000
Mr. Yu is trapped

682
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,079
in anxiety.

683
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,559
But she came here

684
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,559
all by herself.

685
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,400
Those people are becoming

686
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,639
her outsourcing team,

687
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,559
which is more efficient than yours.

688
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,160
Marvelous!

689
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,559
She earned more than I do.

690
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,680
A new broom

691
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,599
sweeps clean.

692
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,000
Her room has been cleaned up.

693
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,000
Afterward,

694
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,039
we'll see how strong the support

695
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,200
from Mr. Zhang can be.

696
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
In my opinion,

697
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,960
give her all the tasks

698
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,639
to finish!

699
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,480
The more, the better!

700
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
We'll see

701
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,319
if she on earth

702
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,839
has multi-tasking ability.

703
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,760
You're being mean to her!

704
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm doing it for you.

705
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,920
Let me tell you.

706
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,599
You must raise your head up!

707
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,079
Dad,

708
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,920
it's the best

709
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,160
recovery massage oil.

710
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,119
It's not painful.

711
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,039
No strange smell at all.

712
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,039
Don't worry...

713
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,400
Are you using it as a snuff bottle?

714
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,680
Dad,

715
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,039
good for you!

716
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I'll massage gently.

717
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,680
Gently.

718
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,480
It's okay.

719
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,839
Don't worry, Mom.

720
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,920
Is it a little painful?

721
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,319
A little bit?

722
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,480
I'll apply it gently, Dad.

723
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,480
Right away.

724
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,400
It's painful at first.

725
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,119
You're sweating.

726
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,680
Sorry, Dad.

727
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,039
I'll be gentle!

728
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,039
Mom, the rehabilitation training

729
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,400
is arranged

730
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,000
too frequently.

731
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,599
An said

732
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,760
it's the prime time to do the training.

733
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,680
We can't wait!

734
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,520
Your dad said he'll help you

735
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,879
look after the baby after recovery.

736
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,559
Why do I need Dad

737
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
to look after our kid?

738
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,960
As long as Dad

739
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,319
has a healthy body,

740
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,240
you can be our

741
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,760
art director,

742
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,319
guiding us

743
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,559
how to cultivate our kid

744
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,760
as clever and pretty

745
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,680
as Xin!

746
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,200
Dad.

747
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,960
Not bad.

748
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,879
He can move it.

749
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,160
Still painful?

750
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:22,639
Comfortable now.

751
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,879
Dad, when you recover,

752
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,079
I'll take you and mom to travel

753
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,760
all around China

754
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,240
to enjoy beautiful sights.

755
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,799
Finally, I'll bring you to

756
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,680
your birthplace,

757
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,440
the Northeast China

758
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,559
which snows heavily in winter.

759
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,279
Dress mom up as Snow White,

760
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,359
and take a wedding photo of you.

761
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,079
Dad?

762
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,799
Do you want to freeze us to death?

763
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,480
Are you happy?

764
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:44,440
Mom.

765
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:45,920
Mom.

766
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,559
Lin, why are you here?

767
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,920
I heard that Dad fell down.

768
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,559
What's the matter?

769
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,799
I... I failed to help him up.

770
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,559
It's not a big deal.

771
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,480
There's no need to visit us.

772
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,160
I can take good care of him.

773
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,799
I have to pay a visit,

774
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,960
or Meng'an will be worried.

775
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,680
Dad,

776
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,400
training is important,

777
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,720
but be careful.

778
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:09,920
Okay.

779
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,639
It's okay.

780
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,400
Is that true?

781
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,319
I can't tell.

782
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,000
Right.

783
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,639
Good for Wendy!

784
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:34,920
The young man is handsome!

785
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Yes, Wendy.

786
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,639
The handsome is so warm!

787
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,559
Ms. Zhang,

788
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,480
is it true

789
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,440
about Wendy?

790
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,639
She's not naive.

791
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,680
Didn't you see the description?

792
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,119
She has two kids,

793
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,359
divorced her husband

794
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:12,960
by cheating with a male doctor,

795
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,240
and got a large amount of money.

796
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,480
Photos don't lie.

797
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:16,920
I can't believe

798
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,559
Wendy would do that!

799
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,559
It also said

800
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,879
she collided with other agencies

801
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,079
to short sale the company

802
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,200
back there,

803
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
and blackmailed a lot of money!

804
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,559
Mr. Zhou must be careful.

805
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,599
Wendy.

806
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:30,480
Wendy.

807
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,200
Mr. Zhou wants you

808
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,279
to his office.

809
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,079
Got it.

810
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,319
Search for the IP address

811
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:04,879
on the Internet,

812
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,000
and find out who's behind it.

813
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,720
I'll trace the person to the end

814
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,799
who bullies the employee of Yaohui Co.

815
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,879
I'll do it now.

816
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,039
Come here, Wendy.

817
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,079
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou,

818
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,359
for affecting our company

819
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,720
in such a bad manner.

820
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,039
Your reputation is hurt.

821
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,559
Why do you apologize to me?

822
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,559
You may be avenged

823
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,400
due to the financial product

824
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,319
of the real estate company

825
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,599
that you inspected.

826
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:32,480
Managers of that company

827
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,359
talked to me

828
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,760
if I didn't publicize the report,

829
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,480
they will give me a lot of money,

830
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
but I decided to

831
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,440
publicize it.

832
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,559
I don't want those

833
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,359
innocent people

834
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,520
to suffer the loss.

835
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,000
The Deputy Director

836
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,720
was fired because of that.

837
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,000
I think he might be the one.

838
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,240
You did it in the right way.

839
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,279
I support you.

840
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,440
But Wendy,

841
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,839
you must be careful.

842
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,000
After all, you have two kids.

843
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,160
You have a family to protect.

844
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,000
If you have any trouble,

845
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,039
talk to me in time.

846
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,960
Has the lunatic

847
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,760
harassed you already?

848
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,119
He was sent to the police station.

849
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,319
The last plot failed,

850
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,319
and another plot comes.

851
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

852
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,720
It's my personal business,

853
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,039
so I didn't tell you.

854
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,559
I never expected it could

855
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,480
bring such a big trouble

856
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,720
to our company.

857
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
This incident has no effect

858
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,119
on Yaohui Co.

859
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,279
I just hope the effect on you

860
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,920
can be under control.

861
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,680
Don't worry.

862
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
The incident won't affect me.

863
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,760
Anyway,

864
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,319
I have my back against the wall.

865
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,559
Don't worry, Wendy.

866
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,119
In Yaohui Co.

867
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,760
I'm your strongest support.

868
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,639
Don't take those rumors

869
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:36,639
into heart.

870
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,520
I won't allow them

871
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,599
to hurt you.

872
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,839
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

873
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,599
Let's go.

874
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,920
Where are we going?

875
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,879
Follow me.

876
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,079
Let's put the work aside.

877
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,079
I have an announcement.

878
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,400
Our colleague, Chen Wanzhen,

879
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,639
as the project leader,

880
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:56,079
successfully signed a contract with

881
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,079
Aiying, a mother-and-kid flagship brand.

882
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,760
I'll keep the promise I made.

883
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,200
From now on,

884
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,000
Chen Wanzhen is promoted

885
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,400
into the Senior Manager,

886
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,720
in charge of all items

887
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,119
on the mother-and-kid track!

888
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,240
Let's congratulate Wendy!

889
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,160
Wendy,

890
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,319
congratulations!

891
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,680
Mr. Zhou.

892
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,039
Say something.

893
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,839
Actually, my achievement

894
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,160
is closely connected

895
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,480
with your help.

896
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,520
I also thank Mr. Zhou

897
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,920
for the trust and support.

898
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,559
I'm willing to devote

899
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,520
all my power and energy

900
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
to Yaohui Co.

901
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,160
Thank you all.

902
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:52,520
Want a drink?

903
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,480
Yes.

904
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,839
That's right.

905
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,599
Do you know why

906
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,960
you are always demotivated?

907
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,920
You lack the soul of a laborer:

908
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,079
coffee.

909
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,639
Director Huang,

910
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,200
your dress looks awesome!

911
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,240
I didn't wear it in the morning.

912
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,720
I just changed it.

913
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,000
I changed my suit at noon.

914
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,920
I have a client this evening.

915
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,400
Your residence is so near!

916
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,559
It was far,

917
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,400
but I moved next door to the company,

918
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,839
after starting work.

919
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,839
It's convenient to work overtime.

920
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,799
You work too hard!

921
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,279
It's so late now,

922
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,279
can you fall asleep

923
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,160
after drinking coffee?

924
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,240
A perfect match with overwork.

925
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,760
I should learn from you!

926
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Learn from me?

927
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,039
You're slimmer than me!

928
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,279
Well,

929
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,319
I practice yoga every week.

930
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,400
Next time,

931
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,359
let's practice yoga together!

932
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,599
Okay, you can use my card!

933
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:56,559
Okay!

934
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,799
So pretty!

935
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,720
Do you think so?

936
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,960
Yes, I want to buy one.

937
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,359
It's so good to be single.

938
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,559
I'm also single!

939
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,039
You lose, apparently.

940
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,440
Why am I defeated?

941
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,599
Have you moved your home for work?

942
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,119
No.

943
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:16,520
Have you changed your suit

944
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,440
before seeing a client?

945
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,000
I'll buy one after work.

946
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,920
The same dress?

947
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,480
As if the dress suits you.

948
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,079
My figure also looks great

949
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,520
if I wear the same dress.

950
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,319
Okay, fine.

951
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,119
Stop criticizing me.

952
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,720
Look at yourself.

953
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,359
What do you wear when you

954
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,039
see a client?

955
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,240
When she's married,

956
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:41,799
with the old

957
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,440
and the young to look after,

958
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,359
she might be shabbier than me!

959
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,240
Good self-consistency.

960
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,839
Have you ever heard of an idiom?

961
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,559
What?

962
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,639
A stick in my throat.

963
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,639
Gonna lose!

964
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,559
Tits up!

965
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,000
I told you the color suits you!

966
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,960
Really!

967
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,720
Let me see.

968
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,799
It's pretty.

969
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:25,279
It matches your complexion.

970
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:28,920
Director Xu.

971
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,520
Director Xu.

972
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:30,639
Am I bothering you?

973
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,160
No.

974
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,680
Here's the thing.

975
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,359
I have

976
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,639
assigned the work

977
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,599
of the main part.

978
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:36,879
Two Deputy Directors

979
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,799
are ready for work,

980
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:38,839
who have their own

981
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:39,720
work and jurisdiction.

982
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,520
This is my assignment plan.

983
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,680
After you finish reading it,

984
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,760
you can talk to me privately.

985
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:45,799
With assignment

986
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,400
and cooperation,

987
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,920
we can manage to promote

988
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,680
our work!

989
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,279
Okay?

990
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:50,839
Okay.

991
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,480
Yours.

992
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,480
Meichuan is not familiar

993
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,720
with the content.

994
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,680
You are more capable,

995
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,879
so you can work more,

996
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,839
and teach her how to do it.

997
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,639
No problem, Director Xu.

998
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
I have a small present for you.

999
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:06,520
Don't.

1000
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
I feel under pressure

1001
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,960
if you keep doing it.

1002
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,920
Thank you.

1003
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,359
Okay.

1004
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,440
I'll delegate my power to you.

1005
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:13,559
Come on!

1006
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:14,520
Okay.

1007
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay.

1008
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:26,400
How's Xin?

1009
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,680
Have a fever again?

1010
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,319
Alright.

1011
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,760
I'll pay a visit to Dad,

1012
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,720
and then visit her.

1013
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,079
Why does she have a fever again?

1014
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,440
Director Xu,

1015
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,680
I've finished reading my part,

1016
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,400
and I want to talk to you.

1017
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,559
Now?

1018
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,320
Are you leaving?

1019
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,360
It's time to be off duty.

1020
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,920
It'll only take you a few minutes.

1021
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
For today's tweet,

1022
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,520
I have a new idea.

1023
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,239
What's your idea?

1024
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,440
Can I change today's tweet

1025
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,759
according to the hotspot?

1026
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,719
Is it possible?

1027
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,440
It will be uploaded at nine.

1028
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,360
The time is so limited.

1029
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,119
It's possible.

1030
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,360
Aren't you seeing a client?

1031
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,159
It doesn't matter.

1032
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,719
We have to pursue

1033
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,000
the new hotspot!

1034
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:21,960
Am I right?

1035
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,199
We're not working for the press.

1036
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,559
But hotspots can't be missed.

1037
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,759
Director Xu,

1038
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,759
since you give me

1039
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:28,920
the task,

1040
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,559
you should support me

1041
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,559
and delegate power

1042
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
when I get new ideas!

1043
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,400
Fine.

1044
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,480
I let you take charge of the duty

1045
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,759
because I trust you.

1046
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:42,400
Okay.

1047
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,360
Wait for my action!

1048
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,320
Bye-bye.

1049
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,239
How intense the competition is!

1050
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,880
Alright.

1051
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,199
The treadmill is ready.

1052
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:58,840
Let me

1053
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,599
have a try first.

1054
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:01,960
I'll teach you how to use it.

1055
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,119
See?

1056
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,840
There's a green button.

1057
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,360
It starts when you press it.

1058
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,960
Press it.

1059
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:10,840
See?

1060
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,679
The speed

1061
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,880
is slow.

1062
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,400
Very cozy.

1063
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,800
That's how we do it.

1064
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,360
Very easy.

1065
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,840
Right?

1066
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,119
You can speed it up.

1067
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Ready?

1068
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,440
Speed it up.

1069
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,000
Speed it up.

1070
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,520
Speed it up.

1071
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Speed it up.

1072
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,280
Speed it up.

1073
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,599
Speed it up!

1074
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,400
It's too fast!

1075
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:34,559
Don't!

1076
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
Hurry up!

1077
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,440
Help me press the pause button!

1078
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,000
Help me!

1079
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,800
Press the pause!

1080
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,360
Where is it?

1081
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,639
The red button!

1082
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,280
Press it!

1083
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,719
The red one!

1084
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,800
I'm doing it!

1085
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,360
I can't hold on anymore!

1086
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:54,880
Which one?

1087
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,599
Hurry up!

1088
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,759
Stop!

1089
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,520
Jesus! It's so frightening!

1090
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,039
I was hoaxed!

1091
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,599
I told him

1092
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,679
to find me a walking machine,

1093
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,440
but the salesman

1094
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,880
said it had all the functions.

1095
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,360
See?

1096
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,719
The price is tenfold higher.

1097
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,520
Well,

1098
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,239
Jing,

1099
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,320
refund the treadmill.

1100
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,159
I won't.

1101
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,719
Put it aside

1102
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,159
somewhere.

1103
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,199
Perhaps,

1104
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,520
in less than one year,

1105
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,199
he can use it.

1106
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:38,280
What's going on?

1107
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,480
Why are you breathing heavily?

1108
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,920
Well,

1109
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
I bought a treadmill

1110
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,559
for your father.

1111
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:45,800
Is it useful?

1112
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,360
Not now.

1113
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,360
It's a little bit fast.

1114
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,679
It's okay.

1115
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm glad you're back.

1116
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,360
Okay, I...

1117
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
I'll go back

1118
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,280
to cook for them.

1119
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,199
No need.

1120
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,880
They must have eaten outside.

1121
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:01,800
I'll visit Xin

1122
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
in a while.

1123
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Let's eat some at home.

1124
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,079
Yes, eat at home.

1125
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,039
Okay.

1126
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,079
If we can't use the treadmill,

1127
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,000
I have other ways.

1128
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,119
Wait.

1129
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:12,559
What?

1130
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,440
Let me fetch it to you.

1131
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,199
Still more?

1132
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:17,239
I have something else.

1133
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,719
The treadmill

1134
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,079
caught our attention,

1135
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:21,920
and I forgot this.

1136
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,679
Old man!

1137
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,320
My husband

1138
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,920
made up a prescription.

1139
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,520
All good medicine.

1140
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,759
I'll let Lanxiang boil it.

1141
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,520
Bitter medicine cures sickness.

1142
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:39,960
Good for health!

1143
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,239
If only Xin

1144
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,800
is as obedient

1145
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,759
as your husband did!

1146
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,599
She wouldn't have suffered a lot.

1147
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:49,840
An,

1148
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,759
go to the hospital to see

1149
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:52,719
if she's okay.

1150
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,079
If possible,

1151
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,199
don't let her breastfeed.

1152
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,000
I also have the intention.

1153
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,480
But she doesn't want to see me.

1154
00:39:59,039 --> 00:39:59,639
Haowen also

1155
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,880
gave me a phone call,

1156
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,119
saying she has a fever.

1157
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,440
Well, I have no choice

1158
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,840
but to go and comfort her.

1159
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,679
I'm ready for her scolding.

1160
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,199
Exactly.

1161
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,159
You're right.

1162
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,199
Persuade her as much as you can.

1163
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,159
I know

1164
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,880
she doesn't want to breastfeed,

1165
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,000
but it's not healthy

1166
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,320
to do it abruptly.

1167
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,280
When the mammary gland

1168
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:17,960
is working smoothly,

1169
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,639
she suddenly

1170
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,599
cut it off

1171
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,400
to block the way,

1172
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,039
and she's doomed to have a fever!

1173
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,759
If she wants to wean, take it slowly.

1174
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:27,239
Right?

1175
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,920
She can't be capricious.

1176
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,239
I made up a prescription for her.

1177
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,320
I'll let Lanxiang make it for her,

1178
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,559
and it will be fine.

1179
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,759
Take your hands off!

1180
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:54,960
Darling,

1181
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,079
change the ice bandage?

1182
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,079
I think the ice bandage

1183
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,440
has been used for too long

1184
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,719
and it may not be effective anymore.

1185
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:02,759
Darling?

1186
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,079
Change it now!

1187
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,039
Okay.

1188
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,400
I'll help you change it.

1189
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,159
Stop hemming and hawing!

1190
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:12,800
Strip it off.

1191
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,599
It's so warm.

1192
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,599
Okay.

1193
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,480
Be careful.

1194
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,840
Take care.

1195
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,440
Okay.

1196
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,480
My hair!

1197
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,559
I'll change a new one for you.

1198
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:23,840
Here you are.

1199
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,239
Okay.

1200
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,119
Your weight is crushing me!

1201
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:33,320
Am I?

1202
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:35,880
Do you feel better?

1203
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,239
I feel sick.

1204
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,000
Darling,

1205
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,759
have a good rest.

1206
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,000
I'll go to see someone.

1207
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,159
Mr. Jia, will you go to the company?

1208
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,559
No.

1209
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,639
If available,

1210
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,079
go to the company for work.

1211
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:10,759
During your absence,

1212
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:11,759
many procedures

1213
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:12,960
can't be promoted.

1214
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,880
Your long absence

1215
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,119
has incurred complaints.

1216
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,639
What are the complaints?

1217
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,280
Can't the others run the company?

1218
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,199
I'm just absent for two weeks,

1219
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,320
and you keep complaining.

1220
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,400
What's the point?

1221
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,719
Yesterday, you were absent

1222
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,320
from the board.

1223
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,639
You're absent for three times.

1224
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,400
All shareholders are complaining.

1225
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:28,079
Let me tell you.

1226
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,119
Nothing in the company

1227
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,480
values more than my family!
