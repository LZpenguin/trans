Just in Time EP25

3
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:36,879
Mr. Qian.

4
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,319
I am no longer

5
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,639
Mr. Qian anymore.

6
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,999
Just call me Qian Peng.

7
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,319
I heard from Feifei,

8
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,640
that you have already left the company.

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,319
Isn't that all thanks to you?

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,920
Chen Wanzhen.

11
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,000
I used to be the Vice President of Sales,

12
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,479
a regional leader, so to speak.

13
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,160
But now the company's under investigation.

14
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,560
I invested all my savings,

15
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,399
into the company's financial products.

16
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,920
Now, I can't withdraw a single cent.

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,839
My ten years of hard work,

18
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,239
have now been wiped out completely.

19
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,080
Do you know that?

20
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,959
Chen Wanzhen.

21
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
We must have a conscience in life.

22
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,879
I was so good to you before.

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,959
I treated you better

24
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:26,839
than any other salespeople.

25
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,679
You know that?

26
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,720
I took on so much pressure

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,080
to get you into the sales department.

28
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,679
I reserved the best listings,

29
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,399
just for you.

30
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,920
So, you could make sales and earn money.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,479
I even let you come late and leave early

32
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,239
to pick up your kid,

33
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,160
and attend training classes.

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,839
But look at you now.

35
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,239
You've climbed high

36
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,640
and turned around to ruin me.

37
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,280
Chen Wanzhen.

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
You can't be so vicious to me.

39
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,479
Mr. Qian.

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,959
I'm trying to save you.

41
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,679
If I don't speak up.

42
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,360
How many families will end up bankrupt?

43
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,159
Especially the elderly ones.

44
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,839
They are our long-time owners.

45
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,520
Our old clients.

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
What did they do wrong?

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,080
You're an adult now.

48
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,600
You should be accountable

49
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,679
for your actions.

50
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:15,920
Chen Wanzhen.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
I speak to you with emotion,

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,040
and you respond with logic, right?

53
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:20,880
You've caused my current situation.

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,999
Just want a kind word from you.

55
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:22,600
Is that too much to ask?

56
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,520
Just say something nice to me.

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,320
Is that too much?

58
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Qian.

59
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,880
I have nothing more to say.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,679
Take care of yourself.

61
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,239
My aunt has now gone back to our hometown.

62
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,159
Living at home feels like

63
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,279
I'm on vacation,

64
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,959
with an umbrella over my head.

65
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,360
It's like I'm camping out.

66
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,040
Right now,

67
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,399
I eat whatever I want.

68
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,040
I lie down whenever I want.

69
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,520
No one tells me I'm unhealthy anymore.

70
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:05,999
Is that right?

71
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,480
Not listening to the elders,

72
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,719
living happily for years.

73
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,399
Li Lin.

74
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,920
Can you speak properly?

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,959
What's with your attitude?

76
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,800
Wait a second.

77
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:22,959
What attitude?

78
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,399
I've always had this attitude.

79
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm saying all this for your own good.

80
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,520
You're doing this for my good?

81
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,959
Is this really for my good?

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,640
Can you speak with your conscience?

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,119
No, no, no.

84
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,800
Am I doing this for myself?

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
For myself?

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,399
Isn't this doing it for yourself?

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,159
This is really strange.

88
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:37,839
Look.

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,239
Didn't I say there were mosquitoes?

90
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,320
Just spray a bit, so what?

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,040
It's not toxic.

92
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,800
I said I don't want it.

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
But you insisted on it.

94
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,360
Is this how you do things?

95
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,839
Fine, then I won't care, okay?

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,679
I won't care anymore.

97
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,279
Whether you care or not.

98
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,239
Don't care for the rest of your life.

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,080
Mom.

100
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Dad.

101
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,880
She...

102
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,120
This is really ridiculous.

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,640
Really.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,240
What's going on here?

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,240
None of your business. You...

106
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,359
Go do your homework!

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,799
She went out.

108
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:12,359
Look at this.

109
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,640
In the middle of the night.

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,959
Alright, go do your homework.

111
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,640
I'll go find her.

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
What's going on?

113
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,680
What's there to argue about?

114
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,959
First, let's talk about you, Dad.

115
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,680
My mom is pregnant.

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,919
She can't get upset, you know?

117
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,479
And what about gentlemanly conduct?

118
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,599
Where's the civility and manners?

119
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:00,919
Normally, aren't you

120
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
always defending my mom?

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
What's the matter with you?

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,279
Dropping the ball at the crucial moment.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,799
Stop it.

124
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,200
And as for you, Mom,

125
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,760
don't think just because you are pregnant,

126
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,279
you can do whatever you want.

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,799
Do you think that you don't have

128
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,719
problems at all?

129
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:16,680
Think about it.

130
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,080
Dad's doing it for your own good.

131
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,760
Right?

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,839
I think you've been

133
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,240
acting like you've swallowed a bomb.

134
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,200
waiting to explode at any time.

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,520
If you scare

136
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,680
Little Grape, what then?

137
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,880
Can you take responsibility?

138
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,680
It's such a serious issue.

139
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,640
Think it through.

140
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,680
Reflect on it.

141
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:29,680
It takes two to tango.

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,399
You should reflect too.

143
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,479
Still making me worry.

144
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,799
I'm worried sick.

145
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,880
Do you know how worried I am?

146
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,080
Try again in a different way.

147
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,799
Where could they go?

148
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,919
It's so late.

149
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,959
There's no one here.

150
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,440
Are they really fighting?

151
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,959
Your dad dares to fight with your mom?

152
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,799
Really.

153
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,120
Trust me, really.

154
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,839
They were quarreling fiercely.

155
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,520
I was stunned at the time. I said...

156
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,080
Oh my god, my dad

157
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,320
Dare to talk to my mom like that?

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,640
Seriously.

159
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,000
At the time, my mom left.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,320
and my dad ran after her.

161
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,080
Where else could they go?

162
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,320
It's so late at night.

163
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,880
Where else can they go?

164
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
Exactly.

165
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,839
Look at these two.

166
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,320
They really cause so much worry.

167
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Is that the one?

168
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,839
Which one?

169
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,599
Look over there. Is that a person?

170
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:41,599
No, it's not.

171
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,440
Smells so good.

172
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm getting hungry.

173
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,919
Yeah, smells great.

174
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,799
Come on, clink glasses.

175
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,560
Alright.

176
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,000
Three bottles.

177
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,000
Boss, add two more squid skewers.

178
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,440
You've been craving this long, right?

179
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,080
Feels like a lifetime ago.

180
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,719
Here, your skewers are ready.

181
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,159
Take this flashlight stick.

182
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,760
Don't go over there.

183
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,120
Is it tasty?

184
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,719
It's okay.

185
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,080
Are you happy?

186
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,680
Is this fun for you two?

187
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,680
Just for some barbecue,

188
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,839
you argue and lie to the kid.

189
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,520
What did Auntie say?

190
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,560
How should we live healthily?

191
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,039
This barbecue...

192
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,919
and this...

193
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,760
can you eat this?

194
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,120
No.

195
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,839
And it's so late already,

196
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,399
you're still eating unhealthy things?

197
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,080
Is this right?

198
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,560
No, it's not.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,440
Speak up.

200
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,359
Were you two

201
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,200
planning this for a long time?

202
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:06,839
No.

203
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,279
Yes.

204
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,479
No.

205
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,479
Just now, weren't the two of us

206
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
arguing just now?

207
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,799
Pretending? Didn't we agree

208
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,520
that the three of us

209
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,799
would go out for barbecue

210
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,039
to eat and then air out the smell?

211
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,399
Why didn't you take me?

212
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,199
This... this is...

213
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,600
We couldn't sleep at night,

214
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,720
and wanted to go out on a date

215
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,159
with your dad.

216
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,720
With me, it's not romantic, right?

217
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,720
It is.

218
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,159
But,

219
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,000
Isn't it a bit different?

220
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,319
He Lu.

221
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,279
Are your parents like this too?

222
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know.

223
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,399
We're all unnecessary.

224
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,480
Twenty more minutes

225
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,919
and I'll be leaving this company.

226
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,679
If Mr. Yu doesn't see me off,

227
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,319
I'll let the whole world know,

228
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:45,720
that you used me and dumped me.

229
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,559
Stop, Huang Sisi.

230
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,640
Let's clarify what that means first.

231
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,120
What do you mean by 'used and dumped'?

232
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,840
From the start until now,

233
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
have we ever messed around?

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Nineteen more minutes.

235
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,919
Your contract with Blue Ocean

236
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,000
will automatically terminate.

237
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,480
Let's part on good terms, okay?

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,760
These three years

239
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,679
we've worked together as colleagues.

240
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,799
You've made many contributions

241
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,319
to the company.

242
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,720
But Blue Ocean hasn't treated you badly.

243
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,960
and offered you great terms.

244
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,279
I even wrote you

245
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,079
a good recommendation letter.

246
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,120
Let's part on good terms.

247
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,120
And your next job

248
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,159
is already lined up, right?

249
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,799
You're going to Xinmiao.

250
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,159
Right?

251
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,480
Let's not tangle any further.

252
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,000
Where I go next,

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
isn't things Mr. Yu needs to worry about.

254
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,360
Fine.

255
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,480
Just go.

256
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,679
But,

257
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,520
I still have some advice for you.

258
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,159
You see, our city

259
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,439
is so small.

260
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,120
Right?

261
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,319
This circle is small too.

262
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,919
Why don't you switch to another city?

263
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,399
I promise, with all my ability,

264
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,880
to help you find a good company

265
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,480
and negotiate good terms for you.

266
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,279
How does that sound?

267
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,279
Why?

268
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,760
Why should I be the one to leave?

269
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,120
Why does it have to be me?

270
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,799
Why do I have to leave this city

271
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,240
and

272
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,840
the network I've cultivated for years?

273
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,480
Yu Hai.

274
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,439
You...

275
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,079
You don't actually

276
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,240
blame your divorce

277
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,520
on me, do you?

278
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,279
No, no way.

279
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,199
Absolutely not.

280
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,319
My divorce is my own issue.

281
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:26,960
It has nothing

282
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,079
to do with you at all.

283
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:30,000
The reason I'm advising you this way

284
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,439
is really for your own good

285
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:32,000
dear.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,919
With me, you're already

287
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,559
a content director.

288
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,399
At Xinmiao, at most you'll be

289
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,679
a deputy director.

290
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,960
Right? I know Xinmiao's

291
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,799
situation very well.

292
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,720
Xu Meng'an is firmly

293
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,679
established there.

294
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,039
Plus, she's very skilled.

295
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,919
It's hard to shine at Xinmiao.

296
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,640
You're unlikely to get ahead.

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,199
Why not just switch cities?

298
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:47,919
Right?

299
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,039
The sea is vast for fish to leap.

300
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,919
The sky is high for birds to fly.

301
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,399
How wonderful.

302
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,600
Talking for so long,

303
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,079
going around in such a big circle.

304
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,079
I really thought

305
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,559
you were doing it for my good.

306
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,559
Turns out it was for

307
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,079
your old classmate, Xu Meng'an.

308
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,279
A classmate working

309
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,679
at a rival company

310
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,039
is more important to you than me.

311
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,439
Huang Sisi.

312
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,319
Don't talk.

313
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,679
Actually,

314
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,799
I haven't decided

315
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,199
if I'm really going to Xinmiao.

316
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
But at the award ceremony that day

317
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,000
I noticed your classmate

318
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,240
was pregnant.

319
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
It's an opportunity.

320
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,199
So,

321
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,159
this deputy director position

322
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,559
it's just temporary.

323
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,319
Understand?

324
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,799
You, wipe your eyes clean,

325
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,199
and watch closely.

326
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,760
Whether I have you or not,

327
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,199
I can still get things done.

328
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
Why are you like a loach

329
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,159
slipping into every crack you see?

330
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:45,840
Fine.

331
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,199
Let's see

332
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,600
how you fare without my Blue Ocean platform.

333
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,240
Let's see what you're really worth.

334
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,760
I'd like to see as well

335
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,799
how Blue Ocean does without Huang Sisi.

336
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,439
How much weight will it lose?

337
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,079
Fine.

338
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
Hello, are you Chen Wanzhen?

339
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,279
That's me.

340
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,559
Is it my turn?

341
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,199
Yes, it is.

342
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,079
Excuse me,

343
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,279
who will be interviewing me?

344
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,799
Which department head?

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,919
Our boss.

346
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,520
Zhou Yao.

347
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
He asked to interview you personally.

348
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:28,960
Mr. Zhou?

349
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,120
I'm also surprised.

350
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,679
This is the first time that Mr. Zhou

351
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,079
has personally interviewed

352
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,600
a candidate of your level.

353
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,279
Please follow me.

354
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,399
Come in.

355
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,439
Mr. Zhou, Ms. Chen is here.

356
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,360
Wendy.

357
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,319
You're finally back.

358
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,600
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

359
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,159
No one has called me Wendy in a long time.

360
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,399
Only you call me that.

361
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,720
Can I be like everyone else?

362
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Come, sit.

363
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,439
You have my contact information,

364
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,079
so why did you still

365
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,559
send your resume to HR?

366
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,439
I wanted to see

367
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,439
if I could get into Yaohui Co.

368
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,120
through my own abilities.

369
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,960
But I heard from a headhunter,

370
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,679
that not only did you knock on my door,

371
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,880
you knocked on several others' doors too.

372
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,039
You've even had a round of interviews.

373
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,840
You've had one round of interviews.

374
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,520
Yaohui Co. is always my first choice.

375
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,360
Actually

376
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,559
I just retook my professional

377
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,559
qualification exams.

378
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I don't know

379
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,399
what my worth is

380
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
in this industry right now.

381
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,919
So, you didn't want to come to me.

382
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,679
Afraid that your abilities aren't enough

383
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,640
and that I'd owe you a favor.

384
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,679
Wendy.

385
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,159
We graduated at twenty-five

386
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,480
and joined investment banking together.

387
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,199
We worked together for seven years.

388
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,199
Investment is all about knowing people.

389
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,199
How could I not know your capabilities?

390
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,600
It's me who lacks confidence now.

391
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,559
After all, I left this industry

392
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,919
for so many years.

393
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,439
This doesn't sound like

394
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,640
something you'd say.

395
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,360
I don't know what you've been through

396
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,760
all these years.

397
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,679
But,

398
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,039
never underestimate yourself.

399
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

400
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,840
This... This is my resume.

401
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,880
This is what I've been doing on recently.

402
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,559
Huaying Real Estate Co.

403
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,880
The financial report and my summary.

404
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,799
Take a look at it.

405
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,079
This isn't urgent.

406
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,319
Wendy.

407
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,039
I've been waiting for you lately.

408
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,279
Just waiting for today.

409
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:34,279
For this moment to happen.

410
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,880
You are knocking on my office door

411
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,199
standing before me and saying,

412
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:38,679
Zhou Yao

413
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,640
I want to return to my old profession.

414
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,319
You must give me

415
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,240
a job.

416
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,439
This is the real Chen Wanzhen.

417
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,640
Alright.

418
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,240
Zhou Yao

419
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,640
I am now

420
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,319
returning to my old profession.

421
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:57,520
You must

422
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,120
provide me with a job.

423
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,279
Chen Wanzhen.

424
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,919
Congratulations.

425
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:02,960
You're hired.

426
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,199
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

427
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,399
Let's start our first

428
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,840
official report.

429
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,079
Back when Wanzhen

430
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,279
suddenly asked for a divorce,

431
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,520
I wanted to keep the peace.

432
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,919
So, I let Huang Sisi leave quickly.

433
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,120
I didn't sign

434
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,039
the non-compete agreement with her.

435
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
Why are you telling me this?

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,439
Is she really coming to Xinmiao?

437
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,960
Yes, it's confirmed.

438
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,079
She already knows that you're pregnant.

439
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,720
And her terms with Mr. Zhang

440
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,360
seem to be mostly agreed upon.

441
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,679
She's heading to your company.

442
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,960
First, take on this deputy director role.

443
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,159
It's just a transitional phase.

444
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,399
Anyone with eyes can see it.

445
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:35,120
It's obviously aiming

446
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,199
for your position.

447
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,439
Well,

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,919
let them come in.

449
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,679
We can't just sit and wait to be defeated.

450
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,880
I've thought of a way

451
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,799
out for you.

452
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,880
What way out?

453
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:45,840
Switch jobs.

454
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,079
Come over to my Blue Ocean.

455
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,799
Can you stop messing around?

456
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,079
No.

457
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,079
Let me tell you.

458
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,279
Don't let Mr. Zhang know

459
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,160
that you met with me today.

460
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,279
Are you seriously trying to poach me?

461
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,680
After all he's done to you.

462
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,960
Are you out of your mind?

463
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,039
You're the one who's out of your mind!

464
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,680
You're still defending him?

465
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,879
Just because you're pregnant,

466
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,559
he wants to bring Huang Sisi

467
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,760
into your company.

468
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,400
That alone is wronging you.

469
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,400
Just for that,

470
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,079
I'll dig him out from under you.

471
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,559
What do you say?

472
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,039
I'll poach his people before his eyes.

473
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,200
We can't just take this crap

474
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,879
in his company.

475
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,879
I won't agree to this!

476
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,599
Yu Hai.

477
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,879
I'm pregnant.

478
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,559
As a company president,

479
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,520
this isn't a wise choice.

480
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,240
Even though we're old classmates.

481
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,000
you don't need to get this worked up.

482
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,319
No, no, no, no, no.

483
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,720
The reason I'm trying to poach you

484
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,039
not just because you are my old classmate.

485
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,079
It's also because

486
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:35,879
I value

487
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,599
your value in the workplace.

488
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,520
Mr. Zhang doesn't understand that,

489
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,520
but I do.

490
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,559
You just had a baby, right?

491
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,720
It's only about a hundred days or so.

492
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,440
I, Yu Hai, can wait.

493
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,799
You're really that loyal?

494
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,720
In my mind,

495
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,319
you truly understand content.

496
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,400
As for me,

497
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,119
I understand the market.

498
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,079
I understand operations.

499
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,799
If we work together,

500
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,639
we'd be a perfect match.

501
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,079
All these years,

502
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
everything you've done...

503
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,520
I've seen it all.

504
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,720
It's not the first time

505
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,879
I've tried to poach you, right?

506
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:04,920
Again and again,

507
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,960
over and over.

508
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,400
You have to give me some credit, right?

509
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,559
Thanks a lot,

510
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,920
but I really can't agree.

511
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,920
To be honest,

512
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,960
Mr. Zhang, these past years,

513
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,400
has actually been quite good to me.

514
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,440
He's anxious now,

515
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,920
partly because of me.

516
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,799
I can't just because of

517
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,879
a moment of instability,

518
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,200
deny all the care he's shown me

519
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,319
over the years, right?

520
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,920
And to say something in spite

521
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,440
if Xu Meng'an decides to leave.

522
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,400
Of course, it's because I want to leave.

523
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,279
I won't be forced out by anyone.

524
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,039
Don't you think so?

525
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,319
But I appreciate your trust.

526
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:34,559
I get it.

527
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,079
No, but,

528
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,039
Huang Sisi will be joining

529
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,160
your company in a few days.

530
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,799
What will you do?

531
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,920
Just,

532
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,319
let it be.

533
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,720
You're something else.

534
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,160
I really admire you.

535
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
You see, your issues

536
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,639
are making me sweat.

537
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,319
Sandy!

538
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
So quickly sorted everything out?

539
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,920
Take a look.

540
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,520
Is there anything else

541
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
that needs to be added?

542
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,639
The comments are very detailed,

543
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:08,440
and very comprehensive.

544
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,119
You've worked hard.

545
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:09,879
It's nothing.

546
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,599
Let me know if you have any issues.

547
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,839
Wendy.

548
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,839
Do you know about mother and baby brands?

549
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,599
Of course I do.

550
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,359
After all, I am

551
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,440
a mother of two children.

552
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,639
Moreover, when I was studying

553
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:20,520
for my MBA,

554
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,200
I also wrote a paper about

555
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,319
this industry.

556
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,279
Good.

557
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,799
Wendy's related report.

558
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,480
Let's have Wendy join this team.

559
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,760
No problem.

560
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,839
Meeting at ten o'clock.

561
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,440
No.

562
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,960
Why are you still sleeping?

563
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Pregnant women.

564
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:02,760
Need rest.

565
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,599
Let me tell you something,

566
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:07,440
I guarantee,

567
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,960
you'll be wide awake instantly.

568
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,079
Huang Sisi is coming.

569
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,879
You knew?

570
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,200
Her contract with Blue Ocean has expired.

571
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,960
You knew?

572
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,279
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

573
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,920
This puts me in a very passive position.

574
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,680
But this is such a big deal.

575
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,480
Why are you acting like

576
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,520
it's no big deal?

577
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,319
I'm anxious on the inside, okay?

578
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,760
I didn't even know she

579
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,279
would come so soon.

580
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,920
Maybe it's because

581
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,200
she found out I'm pregnant.

582
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:39,839
Do you think

583
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,000
it was Mr. Zhang who told her?

584
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,799
It doesn't matter anymore.

585
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,520
As the director, I'm

586
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,960
very upset.

587
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,680
So, what do you plan to do?

588
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,839
What else can I do?

589
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,520
Just face it calmly.

590
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,359
When she arrives

591
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,279
you go on vacation.

592
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,480
And when you come back,

593
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,200
There might really be no place for you.

594
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,119
Each new generation excels the last.

595
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,720
So, the old waves

596
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,839
just die on the beach.

597
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:07,920
Your attitude is not right.

598
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,720
This is way too negative.

599
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,680
You come without a solution,

600
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,799
and yet you stress out a pregnant woman,

601
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,440
spreading anxiety here.

602
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,039
How can you bear this?

603
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,480
Your temper has grown since pregnant.

604
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,079
It's the hormones.

605
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,359
Who doesn't have a bit of a bad temper?

606
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,680
Don't blame everything

607
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,039
on hormones, okay?

608
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,319
I'm just here to

609
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,680
discuss things with you, right?

610
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,119
No.

611
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,079
Whose issue is this then?

612
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,319
You're not anxious, but I'm.

613
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,200
Okay.

614
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,720
What's urgent and what's not?

615
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,680
Go, go, go.

616
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,680
I'm discussing serious matters with you.

617
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,400
Mr. Zhang asked me to

618
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
do the due diligence for Huang Sisi.

619
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,440
She's starting soon.

620
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,680
She'll be on board next week.

621
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:49,480
What do you think?

622
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,000
How come she doesn't even

623
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,680
have a non-compete agreement?

624
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,520
You can sign one with her.

625
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,400
Of course, I'll sign with her.

626
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,559
For Mr. Zhang.

627
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:57,760
I'll make sure she stays with me.

628
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,559
Well done.

629
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,639
I've heard she's quite ruthless.

630
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
She's aggressive.

631
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,960
Do you think she

632
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,520
has asked Mr. Zhang for something?

633
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,839
That's for sure.

634
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,680
I just don't know

635
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,480
what Mr. Zhang promised her.

636
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,760
Otherwise,

637
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,799
She won't accept a demotion,

638
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,279
and come here to be a deputy director.

639
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,680
Actually, if you think about it,

640
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,400
this might not be such a bad thing.

641
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,639
What's good about it?

642
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,319
I think it's good for Mr. Zhang.

643
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:33,440
I dare say,

644
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,359
she won't

645
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,480
stay here long.

646
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,639
You'd better let her stay a bit longer.

647
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,240
After all, I'm pregnant now,

648
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
and my energy isn't what it used to be.

649
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,799
I originally planned to promote

650
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,520
Ling Meichuan and Amu,

651
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,520
but both of them

652
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
had issues with their qualifications.

653
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,359
Even if you teach hand-in-hand,

654
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,920
it would still take a year or so.

655
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,279
What if something happens in the meantime?

656
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,079
What do we do then?

657
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,200
As for Huang Sisi,

658
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,200
her resume shows some ability,

659
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,480
but it's unclear if her ability

660
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,079
is genuinely her own

661
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,119
or if it's due to platform resources.

662
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,639
Resources are also a kind of ability

663
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,440
Let me tell you,

664
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,000
if she's truly capable,

665
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,119
and can help me get things in order,

666
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,279
in order,

667
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,839
I'm willing to delegate authority.

668
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,799
But I can't just throw Mr. Zhang

669
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,400
into a pit.

670
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,680
Even though Mr. Zhang

671
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,879
doing this at this time,

672
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:26,240
is quite hurtful.

673
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,440
But all I can do is show my understanding.

674
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,639
I understand as well.

675
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,799
You said to handle it as usual.

676
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,119
I'll definitely hire you,

677
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,680
a capable deputy director.

678
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,639
But given your current situation,

679
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,599
aren't you afraid she'll

680
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,680
take advantage of your weakness?

681
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,920
Let her take advantage then.

682
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,920
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

683
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,039
During my pregnancy and childbirth,

684
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,440
I'll just keep a low profile.

685
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,319
Whether I can return to the frontline

686
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,200
is still uncertain.

687
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,559
If there's a real battle,

688
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,039
then let's fight.

689
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,240
Who's afraid of whom?

690
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,039
Right.

691
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,359
I've got this.

692
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,240
We're not afraid.

693
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,599
You can be afraid.

694
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,200
She'll probably come

695
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,879
and create a mess first.

696
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,400
What I'm worried about

697
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:11,400
is about to happen.

698
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,119
My anxiety

699
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,680
seems to have been cured by you.

700
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,960
Are we still friends?

701
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,079
Mr. Zhou,

702
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,680
this is our team's

703
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,079
recent research and summary

704
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,119
on various mother and baby products.

705
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,720
We'll leave the data collection

706
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,160
to Wendy.

707
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,480
Wendy,

708
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,920
please follow up on this project.

709
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,079
I'll send you the contact person

710
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,720
from the outsourcing company later.

711
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,520
Okay.

712
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,480
Alright, nothing else,

713
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:46,559
Let's adjourn the meeting.

714
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,279
Wendy, please stay behind.

715
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:53,960
Wendy,

716
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,720
These small, basic tasks.

717
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,160
I'll leave them to you.

718
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
You won't have

719
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,839
any thoughts about it, right?

720
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
No, how could that be?

721
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,319
I know you're just letting me

722
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,000
familiarize myself with the process,

723
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,879
and then quickly

724
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,160
get into the role.

725
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,920
Even if you don't assign it to me,

726
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,440
I would still proactively apply for it.

727
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,520
t's just like playing polo.

728
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,599
A professional athlete

729
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,559
who has trained for years.

730
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
It has muscle memory.

731
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,359
But if not practiced for a long time,

732
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,200
it will become rusty.

733
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,079
So, you need to use

734
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,119
frequent practice

735
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,839
to awaken muscle memory.

736
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,039
You just want to awaken

737
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,000
my muscle memory.

738
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,920
Alright.

739
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,559
From now on,

740
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,680
all these small tasks

741
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,520
will be mine.

742
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,960
Okay, that's great.

743
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
But don't complain

744
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,200
or whine to me.

745
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,000
Let's go. I wouldn't dare.

746
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:44,639
Sorry,

747
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:45,559
this is my parking spot.

748
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:40,960
Chen Wanzhen!

749
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm asking you,

750
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,160
why are you doing this to me?

751
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,279
Qian Peng, what are you trying to do?

752
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,200
I'm asking you!

753
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,000
What are you doing?

754
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:48,879
What's going on?

755
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,200
Who are you?

756
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
This has nothing to do with you.

757
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,920
Ms. Chen, are you okay?

758
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,039
Let me go!

759
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,960
Chen Wanzhen!

760
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:54,960
Chen Wanzhen, call the police!

761
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,119
Chen Wanzhen!

762
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm telling you,

763
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,720
this isn't over, Chen Wanzhen!

764
00:28:58,879 --> 00:28:59,520
Don't move!

765
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:00,839
Let go of me!

766
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,920
Wait here for the police!

767
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,520
Chen Wanzhen, come on.

768
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,440
Call the police.

769
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,400
Go ahead, call!

770
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,000
Let go of me!

771
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:09,960
Is this 110?

772
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,720
Let go of me!

773
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,480
Don't move.

774
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,720
Are you okay?

775
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
I really didn't expect this, Dr. Yu.

776
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,799
You're not just highly educated,

777
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,279
you're also quite fit.

778
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,799
Of course.

779
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,559
I run a lot.

780
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,119
Looks like I should

781
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,559
run even more.

782
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,599
Develop

783
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,359
in all aspects.

784
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,400
What happened with that guy?

785
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,879
Just a minor business dispute.

786
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,200
He didn't handle it well.

787
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,559
You still need to pay attention

788
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,359
to your own safety.

789
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:52,680
Okay.

790
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,599
Good thing you were here today.

791
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,039
Thank you, Dr. Yu.

792
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,119
No problem.

793
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,319
You're welcome.

794
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:02,680
Are you really okay?

795
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,079
I'm fine.

796
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,680
I'm back!

797
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,160
Sis.

798
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,879
Honey, I'm going to pick up Yunjie today.

799
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,079
Yunjie wants to have a treat.

800
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,480
There are wontons in the fridge.

801
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,359
You can eat them yourself.

802
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,879
Meng'an.

803
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,359
Now that you're pregnant,

804
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,039
you get hungry easily.

805
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,799
I made wontons

806
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,480
and froze them for you.

807
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,440
You can cook them whenever you're hungry.

808
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,200
In the wonton wrappers,

809
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,879
I added eggs.

810
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
They're extra chewy.

10811
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,200
Hello,

812
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,160
brother-in-law.

813
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,359
Is sis at home?

814
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,359
Brother-in-law, don't worry.

815
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,440
I'll keep looking.

816
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:49,359
When Lilin comes back later,

817
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,559
I'll ask him.

818
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:51,039
Alright?

819
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,720
I'll call you if I find her.

820
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,000
We're back!

821
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,000
Why are you back?

822
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,599
Your precious daughter

823
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,000
couldn't bear to leave you alone at home.

824
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,400
I'm the best, right?

825
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,160
Yeah, you're the best.

826
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,680
I just called brother-in-law,

827
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,160
sis didn't go home.

828
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,119
Didn't go home?

829
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,720
And her phone

830
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,879
is not reachable now.

831
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,319
So where did she go?

832
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,440
Auntie is an adult.

833
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,559
It's not like she's missing.

834
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,839
Why don't you think about it again?

835
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,599
Does she have any other friends

836
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,680
in Chunjiang?

837
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,119
Let's go look for her.

10838
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,440
Ms. Song.

839
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:46,760
Ms. Song.

840
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,839
Lilin, did you get the address?

841
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,000
Yes, I got it.

842
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,920
I'm on my way.

843
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:51,839
I'll be there soon.

844
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:52,680
Alright, alright.

845
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,480
Call me if you need anything.

846
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,400
Okay, thank you, Ms. Song.

847
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,079
No problem.

848
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,200
See, I told you it's fine.

849
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,680
She must have gone

850
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,480
to find her old foreign teacher friend.

851
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:08,839
She's working as a nanny now.

852
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,639
Isn't she busy enough

853
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,799
with family matters,

854
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,160
serving others?

855
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,440
I'm speechless.

856
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,039
This woman...

857
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,160
I have no words left.

858
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:47,720
What are the dietary fiber requirements

859
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,480
for pregnant and lactating women?

860
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,000
Now, I'd like a student to come up

861
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,200
and use the props on our table,

862
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,799
to create a meal plan

863
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,400
for one day for a pregnant woman,

864
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,160
and explain the principles of the plan.

865
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:58,639
Which student

866
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,680
would like to try?

867
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,079
Alright, this student here.

868
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,200
Pregnant women

869
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
should base the diet on the food pyramid,

870
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,400
balancing nutrition and taste.

871
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,639
They need to consume

872
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:13,039
high-quality carbohydrates daily.

873
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,160
It should be 300 to 500 grams.

874
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,319
For example, breakfast,

875
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,839
we can eat

876
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,879
steamed buns and millet porridge.

877
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,799
Lunch, rice.

878
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,359
Dinner, noodles.

879
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:27,119
Vegetables should be consumed about

880
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:28,680
300 to 500 grams daily.

881
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:32,960
Such as cucumbers, eggplants, carrots.

882
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,599
Fruits, around

883
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,200
200 to 350 grams a day.

884
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,599
High-quality protein

885
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,400
is needed at 200 grams daily.

886
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:46,279
For breakfast, a glass of milk and eggs

887
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:47,599
are essential.

888
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,400
And also,

889
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,599
these shrimp

890
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,599
are the best for high - quality protein.

891
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,800
12,800.

892
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,440
Oh my God.

893
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,599
Nannies are so expensive now!

894
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,679
Sis's value is definitely beyond that.

895
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,679
Why are you looking at me?

896
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,039
She stays at our place,

897
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,440
washes clothes, cooks,

898
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,079
buys groceries and does the cleaning.

899
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,440
We are taking advantage.

900
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,199
Got her to leave.

901
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:32,559
Hello,

902
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,079
are you two looking for a nanny?

903
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,480
We're looking for someone.

904
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,800
Everyone, please be mindful,

905
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,520
this 95% high-concentration

906
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,840
alcohol

907
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,159
cannot be used directly for disinfection.

908
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
You must add

909
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,800
an appropriate amount of distilled water

910
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,960
and dilute it to 75%.

911
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,280
Only then can it be used

912
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,360
for household sanitation disinfection.

913
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,880
Then just use this alcohol.

914
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,159
It's got a higher purity.

915
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,400
Won't it kill the bacteria

916
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,599
completely?

917
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,800
That won't work.

918
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,639
Actually,

919
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,480
this 95%

920
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,800
high-concentration alcohol

921
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,440
directly for disinfection,

922
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
is not very effective.

923
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,079
Because viruses and bacteria

924
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,639
can't be killed

925
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,199
without water.

926
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,440
Really?

927
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,639
Yes, that's why it needs to be diluted.

928
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,719
Just listen to the big sister.

929
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,400
Ms. Jing used to be

10930
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,679
a head nurse.

931
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,480
Right, right.

932
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,639
I've been doing this job my whole life.

933
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,960
Skilled work, you know.

934
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,199
In the future,

935
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,400
we'll work as a maternity matron.

936
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,920
Postpartum women are very weak.

937
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,800
Ensure disinfection and sterilization.

938
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Everyone, come over here.

939
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,159
I'll show you

940
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,840
how to mix it.

941
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:36,960
Alright, come on.

942
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,039
Look,

943
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,800
she's even teaching others now.

944
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,480
Sis was a head nurse, okay?

945
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,239
Talking about disinfection,

946
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,599
who knows it better than her?

947
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:48,639
Exactly.

948
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,239
Making the most of her experience.

949
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,719
She's needed.

950
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,599
How old are you, sis?

951
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,079
How come after retiring

952
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,639
you've learned to lie?

953
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,800
I didn't lie.

954
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,320
I really

955
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,800
just wanted to come and learn.

956
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,119
A maternity nurse.

957
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,119
I never said I'd be a nanny.

958
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,480
But then Meng An got pregnant.

959
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,199
Meng An,

960
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,920
I only found out after coming here.

961
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,840
This nanny job

962
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,320
really pays well.

963
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,400
Anyway, you're not due yet.

964
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,599
So, why not let me work

965
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,639
and get some practice?

966
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,719
What do you mean?

967
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,880
Are you short of money?

968
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,800
You need to earn this money?

969
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,440
Don't you have a pension?

970
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,599
Isn't your brother-in-law supporting you?

971
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,800
Did the family clinic close?

972
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,159
It's not about the money, okay?

973
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,079
You're just bored.

974
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,400
Finding the person is what matters.

975
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,280
Dear.

976
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,639
I support you!

977
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,000
I think learning something

978
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:38,800
is great.

979
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
I'm not stopping her from learning.

980
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,119
But she shouldn't lie

981
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,440
and say she went back home.

982
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,559
I didn't lie to you.

983
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,679
Did you go back?

984
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,400
Did you go back?

985
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,159
That day I...

986
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,960
I had my luggage ready,

987
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,639
I was already at the bus station.

988
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,759
I don't want to see your brother-in-law.

989
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,199
So, I thought

990
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,039
I'd go to the hospital

991
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,679
to see my old classmate.

992
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,480
Is it Xiao Song

993
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,880
that told you that I'm here.

994
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,520
Mr. Ouyang thought

995
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,639
you were still at our place.

996
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,800
We thought you went

997
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,719
back to your hometown.

998
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:06,440
Turns out

999
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,000
you were wandering outside all along.

1000
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,199
You're not going home?

1001
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,199
What's with all the Mr. Ouyang this, and that?

1002
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,000
He's your brother-in-law.

1003
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,159
Stop calling him.

1004
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,400
Then why didn't you answer my calls?

1005
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,800
Wasn't I in class?

1006
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,039
Do you

1007
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,079
never have a break?

1008
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:19,840
Alright, alright, alright.

1009
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,079
If there's to say, we can talk at home.

1010
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:23,960
Dear.

1011
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,480
Where's your luggage?

1012
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,280
Let's grab it and go home.

1013
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,920
Well, I, I, I...

1014
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,840
This training institution...

1015
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,199
they provide accommodation.

1016
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,400
You don't need to worry about me.

1017
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,119
Sis,

1018
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,000
whatever you want to do,

1019
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,199
we won't stop you.

1020
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,559
But one thing,

1021
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:42,880
you have to come home.

1022
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,119
Mom, look!

1023
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
I have rings all over my hands.

1024
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,599
Mom, look!

1025
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,800
Look at the house I built, it's so pretty!

1026
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,239
When I grow up,

1027
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,559
I want to be an architect.

1028
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:57,880
Great!

1029
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,400
I want to sell rings.

1030
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,840
That's awesome!

1031
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,679
Time to eat!

1032
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,520
Okay.

1033
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,480
Ms. Chen.

1034
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,840
Here's a little life hack,

1035
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,800
to share with you.

1036
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:17,520
Hang a few men's clothes,

1037
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,800
on the balcony.

1038
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,520
It can prevent

1039
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,599
unnecessary trouble.

1040
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,759
If you don't have any,

1041
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:22,960
I can lend you some.

1042
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,239
Mom, why are you laughing?

1043
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,880
Yeah.

1044
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,920
Mom suddenly

1045
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,759
thought of something funny.

1046
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,520
What is it?

1047
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,559
What is it?

1048
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,639
Then you share

1049
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,800
something interesting.

1050
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:35,559
Okay.

1051
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:35,960
Today we

1052
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,280
went to visit the museum.

1053
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,800
Yeah.

1054
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,400
We saw it

1055
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,880
a huge T-Rex.

1056
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,520
How big?

1057
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,599
As tall as a house!

1058
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:42,840
Yes.

1059
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,960
That big?

1060
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,719
what are you

11061
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:46,079
to mommy?

1062
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
We are mommy's of

1063
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,400
little dinosaur babies.

1064
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,159
Little twin dinosaur babies.

1065
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,000
Eat up.

1066
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,599
You... you're leaving?

1067
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,159
The client went into early labor.

1068
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,639
I need to hurry to accompany them.

1069
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,599
That's great!

1070
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,639
Alright, alright.

1071
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,159
I'm off.

1072
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,360
Goodbye, goodbye.

1073
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,440
The room is too messy.

1074
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,679
You guys wait here.

1075
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,599
It's fine.

1076
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,159
I'll help you tidy up.

1077
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:16,639
Xiao Wang,

1078
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,079
Jing, come eat something.

1079
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:19,280
No, thanks.

1080
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,880
Who's this?

1081
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,800
This is my sister-in-law.

1082
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,000
She came to pick me up.

1083
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,239
She is so nice.

1084
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:51,759
Let me help you.

1085
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,239
No, no, no need.

1086
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,280
Just stand there and wait for me.

1087
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,199
Come on, come on.

1088
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,320
Don't move, don't move.

1089
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,000
Okay.

1090
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,079
Take the bedding too.

1091
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,039
Li Lin,

1092
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,679
Is there space in the trunk?

1093
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Forget it.

1094
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,599
There's no room at home either.

1095
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,960
Don't take it.

1096
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,639
It's still new.

1097
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,159
Just listen.

1098
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:32,679
Xiao Wang,

1099
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:33,719
Here,

1100
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,880
the bedding is for you.

1101
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,880
Li Lin,

1102
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,440
Thank you, Ms. Jing.

1103
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,520
Come, get your luggage.

1104
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,679
Your family is really nice.

1105
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,000
I'll do it.

1106
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,360
Have I caused a huge trouble?

1107
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,679
It's not a big deal.

1108
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,280
But he's really angry.

1109
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:58,520
Hurry up and leave.

1110
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:01,679
Ms. Jing, take care.

1111
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,639
Okay, goodbye.

1112
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:03,360
Bye-bye.
