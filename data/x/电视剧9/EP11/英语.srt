Just in Time EP11

3
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,719
Morning, Wanzhen.

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,559
Morning, Mr. Sun.

5
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,079
You look great today.

6
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Of course.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,279
I want to bring in

8
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,639
more clients for the company.

9
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,839
I've checked the attendee list.

10
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,999
It consists entirely of premium clients.

11
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,359
As long as they show up,

12
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,800
in our past experience,

13
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,240
you'll make some big deals.

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,120
Really?

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,999
I hope you're right.

16
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Keep in mind that

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,839
it's your first time bringing in clients,

18
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,279
and if you can close the deal,

19
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,999
you'll receive a commission.

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,559
Remember to ask Mr. Qian for it.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,480
Really?

22
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,120
You bet.

23
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,200
Excellent!

24
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,360
Thank you so much.

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,960
I'll leave you to it.

26
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,999
Mrs. Chen, Mrs. Guo,

27
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,240
welcome.

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,360
Here's our brochure.

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
Please have a look.

30
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,400
Please step inside.

31
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,200
Wanzhen,

32
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,240
good for you.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,520
Got a group of clients just by yourself.

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,200
I went to great lengths

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,240
to invite these esteemed guests.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,559
Make sure they receive the utmost care.

37
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,480
Don't you worry.

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,520
I'll tend to them myself.

39
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:45,480
Thanks.

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,360
New guests have arrived.

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,039
Mr. Chen, Mrs. Chen,

42
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,080
welcome.

43
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,640
Take a look at our brochure, please.

44
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,599
The sand table models are inside,

45
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,200
please go in and have a look.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,800
This way please.

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,039
Mrs. Mo,

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,839
Mr. Mo,

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,879
so glad you're here.

50
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,719
Welcome.

51
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,080
Here's the brochure for you,

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
please have a look.

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,520
Thank you.

54
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,480
This is our nephew.

55
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,599
He's a young man with refined taste,

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,719
so we brought him along

57
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,080
to offer us some advice.

58
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:10,759
Ms. Chen, nice to meet you.

59
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,240
Nice to see you.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,520
The models are inside.

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,800
Feel free to take a look.

62
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,159
Chen Wanzhen,

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,759
what do you mean by this?

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,080
Nothing,

65
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:47,759
I just invited

66
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,800
our mutual friends

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
to my wine party and trade show.

68
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,599
You're also welcomed to join us.

69
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,920
What exactly are you going to do?

70
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,080
Thank you so much for

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,159
attending my internal house trade show.

72
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,439
What you have is the property brochure,

73
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,999
which contains details about the properties

74
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:06,999
Huaxing Real Estate

75
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,439
is set to launch soon.

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Recently,

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
a lot of people have been asking me

78
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,480
about my move into sales

79
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
and the real estate industry.

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Today,

81
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,999
I'd like to give my response

82
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:19,839
collectively.

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,439
It's because

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,999
I'm getting a divorce.

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,399
I've dedicated myself to being

86
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,800
a stay-at-home mom for the past 7 years,

87
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,079
which has resulted in a professional void,

88
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,319
leaving me

89
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,759
with no job prospects

90
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,559
outside of sales.

91
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,959
That's why this job

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
is valued by me,

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,920
because I have to earn money

94
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,160
to prove that

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm capable of raising two daughters.

96
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,639
To put it plainly,

97
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,559
I need to close some deals,

98
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,319
so I'm asking for your help.

99
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,999
Thank you.

100
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,439
Today,

101
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,280
I saved the eight best houses

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,160
with the biggest discounts

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,999
for all of you here.

104
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,840
I also hope

105
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,240
that I can help all of you

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,439
find the most satisfying house.

107
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,920
Let's welcome Mr. Yu Hai,

108
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
the father of my daughters,

109
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,559
and my ex-husband.

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
Mr. Yu, nice to meet you.

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,920
We had settled all matters of

112
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,480
property division before our divorce,

113
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,519
and I gave up

114
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,959
all of my shares in Blue Ocean.

115
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,959
Should anyone here

116
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
still have business dealings

117
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,879
with Mr. Yu,

118
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,639
feel free to maintain your trust in him.

119
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
He is a trust-worthy businessman.

120
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,160
I'm also grateful to him

121
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
for fully supporting me

122
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,480
in making the decision

123
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,120
to start an independent life.

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,840
There's one more thing

125
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
I want to share with you all today,

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
about property.

127
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
Before Mr. Yu and I

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,879
made the decision to divorce,

129
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,480
he was generous enough

130
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,559
to transfer the ownership of an apartment

131
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,999
in the downtown area,

132
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,480
a property we had jointly invested in

133
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
after tying the knot.

134
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,759
This generous act provided

135
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,280
my daughter and me

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
with significant security for living.

137
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,439
That's why I am able to

138
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,319
begin a fresh chapter in life

139
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,639
with my children,

140
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,680
with the house serving as a foundation.

141
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,759
Being a beneficiary

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,480
of real estate investment myself,

143
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,480
I'd like to share this approach

144
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,840
with everyone.

145
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,759
Congratulations, Mr. Yu.

146
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,920
On what?

147
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,840
Career success and return to singlehood.

148
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,079
It's a double celebration.

149
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,240
Maybe

150
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,959
you can teach me a lesson.

151
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,240
Get out of here.

152
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,959
In tough times,

153
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,639
a house can offer your family

154
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,600
with the safeguard you need.

155
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,639
Of course,

156
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,160
that's only my personal advice.

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,319
I do hope, though, that everyone here

158
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,879
has a harmonious

159
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
and happy family life.

160
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
Thank you so much everyone

161
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,160
for showing up

162
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,399
and supporting me today.

163
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,920
I would like to thank you,

164
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,999
Mr. Yu.

165
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,240
Cheers, Mr. Yu.

166
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,720
Sounds good.

167
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,199
Let's go and make the payment.

168
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,399
Sure.

169
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:04,920
Yeah.

170
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:05,800
Ladies,

171
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,399
this way please.

172
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,040
Okay.

173
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,199
Mrs. Li,

174
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,559
I just found

175
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,079
a new Yanbang cuisine restaurant.

176
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,759
It's delicious.

177
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,759
Let's call and reserve a table.

178
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,240
It'll be on me,

179
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,680
alright?

180
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,480
See you next time.

181
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,360
See you.

182
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,079
Chen Wanzhen,

183
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,240
can you stop making this mess?

184
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,079
What's wrong?

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Wasn't I behaving well?

186
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,120
You're clearly

187
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,600
using the divorce to play pitiful

188
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,399
and sell your houses,

189
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,240
you know?

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
My reputation

191
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
is completely ruined thanks to you.

192
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
I clarified for you

193
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,079
and thanked you for supporting me.

194
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,720
When did I seek pity?

195
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:41,999
Sure,

196
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,800
what you've said were all true.

197
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
But to them,

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,920
it all sounded

199
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,399
ironic.

200
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,120
Do you know that?

201
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,840
As a sales agent,

202
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,800
if playing pitiful can close some deals,

203
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,280
then I'll do it every day.

204
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,040
Sure, sure,

205
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
you're a good sales person,

206
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,800
alright?

207
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,319
But the houses you're selling,

208
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,639
you're selling them by ruining my image,

209
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,240
you know?

210
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,999
I am someone who values my reputation

211
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,160
above all else.

212
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,079
What about my reputation?

213
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,040
If it wasn't for you lawyer

214
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,439
fighting for custody,

215
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,840
I wouldn't be in a big rush

216
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,199
to prove my financial capability.

217
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:08,879
Wait,

218
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
my lawyer is fighting for custody?

219
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,600
No,

220
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,759
don't get this wrong.

221
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,639
I told him

222
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,120
to try our best to avoid the divorce,

223
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,319
even if it means making it difficult...

224
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,920
That idiot.

225
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,280
I'll fire him the moment I get back,

226
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,840
okay?

227
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,600
We're getting a divorce,

228
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,720
and you're keeping

229
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,639
the company, the stocks, and the villa.

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,519
All I'm asking for is custody of our kids.

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,519
If you're set on

232
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,439
taking that from me,

233
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,639
mark my words, Yu Hai,

234
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,240
I will ruin

235
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,399
your reputation.

236
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,040
Wanzhen,

237
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,040
you've exhausted

238
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,639
all the connections

239
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,519
we've accumulated

240
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,240
over the years

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,120
in just one day.

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,999
Who are you selling houses to after this?

243
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,999
You want to raise our children,

244
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,600
but what will you raise them with?

245
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,639
You feel that I don't respect you enough,

246
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,480
that I'm not good enough to you.

247
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,440
But in what way have I treated you poorly?

248
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,440
Emotionally,

249
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,879
I've never been unfaithful.

250
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,879
As for our special occasions,

251
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,519
I've always given gifts

252
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,639
and flowers

253
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,120
in all of our anniversaries, haven't I?

254
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,159
I wrote down all of them

255
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,080
clearly

256
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,840
in my work journal,

257
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
without missing a single thing.

258
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,440
And when it comes to money,

259
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,519
can any of the ladies present

260
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,999
claim their husbands

261
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:10,999
are as open

262
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,080
about their finances

263
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
with their wives

264
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,360
as I am?

265
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,159
No one could!

266
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,320
If you feel like you have nothing to do,

267
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,120
if you're really bored,

268
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,159
we can have another set of twins.

269
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,960
Between the two of us,

270
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,639
our...

271
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,720
our families,

272
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,480
we both have it in our family.

273
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,120
Maybe we

274
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,360
can even have triplets,

275
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,679
right?

276
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,519
Let's stop this mess.

277
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,600
Let's head back home together, okay?

278
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,080
Who's making the mess here?

279
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,759
We've come this far,

280
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,279
and you still think I'm playing around?

281
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,799
Yu Hai, I'm telling you,

282
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,999
there's really

283
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:35,879
nothing more to say between us.

284
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,999
Let's leave it to the lawyers.

285
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:37,279
No,

286
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,120
wait, Wanzhen,

287
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
wait, wait.

288
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,080
Do you really believe that

289
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
getting a divorce

290
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,679
means you've reached

291
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,759
the peak of your life?

292
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,039
Haven't you considered

293
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,639
how you, a middle-aged woman

294
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,679
with two kids,

295
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,080
are going to navigate your future?

296
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,080
How are you planning to live your life?

297
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,120
My future life is

298
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,080
none of your concern.

299
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,679
You're messing around here

300
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,480
at this hour.

301
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,999
And the kids,

302
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,999
who is looking after them now?

303
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,120
Ms. Chen.

304
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,399
Mr. Yu.

305
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,440
My uncle and aunt

306
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,360
are interested in a house.

307
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,679
They want to discuss it with you.

308
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,999
Of course.

309
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,639
What about the kids?

310
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,279
Who is looking after them now?

311
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:18,600
Hello.

312
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,600
Can you

313
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,320
do anything without me?

314
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,399
What investor?

315
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,840
Mr. Zhang.

316
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,200
Mr. Zhang? Is the gift for him

317
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,999
ready?

318
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,279
Okay, I'm on my way.

319
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,360
Mrs. Mo,

320
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,679
thank you so much today

321
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,480
for closing this deal with me.

322
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,279
No need for that.

323
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,320
We're such good friends.

324
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,399
I need a house

325
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,039
for my son anyway.

326
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
I'll leave

327
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,159
the rest to my nephew.

328
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
It's all on you.

329
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,399
That's it,

330
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:40,879
bye.

331
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:41,519
Goodbye.

332
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,440
Leave them to me, Mrs. Mo.

333
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,879
Sorry.

334
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,159
I actually

335
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,879
recognized you earlier.

336
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
Thank you for the other day, Dr. Yu.

337
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,440
You're welcome.

338
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:54,360
That is

339
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,320
simply my duty.

340
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
It's just you left without a word.

341
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
I was a little worried before.

342
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,120
But,

343
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,840
here you are today,

344
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,600
completely fine,

345
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,560
weren't losing at all in that argument.

346
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,399
That's embarrassing.

347
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,399
I'm so sorry.

348
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,240
I have to thank you today.

349
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,279
Because Mrs. Mo

350
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,080
trusts you,

351
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,799
she settled

352
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,279
on the house so quickly.

353
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,120
It's a house

354
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
for my cousin.

355
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
My aunt probably thinks

356
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,519
I know kids better.

357
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,039
You're not old yourself.

358
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,720
Pretty old,

359
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,120
30 something,

360
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,440
heading towards 40.

361
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
Dr. Yu,

362
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,240
you're still here?

363
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,399
Hi, Ms. Chen,

364
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,919
I had a drink and am waiting for the designated driver.

365
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,039
So do I.

366
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,679
Really?

367
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,360
Dr. Yu.

368
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Just call me Yu Chen.

369
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,320
Thank you so much today.

370
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,120
Excuse me,

371
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,320
did you two call for drivers?

372
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,399
Yes.

373
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,560
Let's go.

374
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,560
Let's go.

375
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,679
"Do you really believe that

376
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,879
getting a divorce

377
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,039
means you've reached

378
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,320
the peak of your life?

379
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,480
How you, a middle-aged woman

380
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,039
with two kids,

381
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,240
are going to navigate your future?

382
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,999
How are you planning to live your life?"

383
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,039
Thank you, sir.

384
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,600
No problem.

385
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,039
You live here too?

386
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
What a coincidence.

387
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,560
Yeah.

388
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:35,999
Today...

389
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,879
No worries.

390
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,799
Chen Wanzhen.

391
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,279
I'll leave you to it.

392
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I'll be heading up.

393
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,200
Goodbye.

394
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,639
Goodbye.

395
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,080
Who is that?

396
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,999
You just met him.

397
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Mr. Mo's nephew.

398
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,919
When did I meet him?

399
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,480
Wait,

400
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,840
why did he

401
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,679
come home with you?

402
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,720
You heard us.

403
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,039
He lives here too. He's a neighbor.

404
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,159
Neighbor? When have I...

405
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,240
I've never seen him.

406
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,999
Ridiculous.

407
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,759
How many times have you been here?

408
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,240
What are you doing?

409
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,159
I'm heading upstairs

410
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,600
to see my kids, okay?

411
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,279
I'm their father.

412
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:22,919
It's too late.

413
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,879
I'm worried about them.

414
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,600
What's wrong with that?

415
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,919
Now you're worried.

416
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,080
What were you doing before?

417
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,320
It's been seven years.

418
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,560
When have you ever thought about the kids

419
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,519
when you were out doing business?

420
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,480
When did you ever

421
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,600
worry about them

422
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,879
when you were out getting drunk?

423
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,639
Don't bring that up with me. It's useless.

424
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
I'm asking you, this late at night,

425
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,639
who's looking after the kids?

426
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,639
I hired a nanny.

427
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,879
Chen Wanzhen,

428
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,600
good for you.

429
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,679
You're fighting me for custody.

430
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,600
And now you have a nanny

431
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,639
look after them?

432
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,840
I can leave the kids

433
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,399
to a nanny too,

434
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,679
and I can look after them better.

435
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,560
I hired a nanny

436
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:49,999
so I

437
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,120
won't get distracted at work.

438
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,240
Yu Hai, I'm telling you,

439
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,320
my love for my children

440
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
won't lose to anyone.

441
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,080
These seven years,

442
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
I brought them up myself.

443
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,480
I will never let you have custody.

444
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
If you want to fight me for it,

445
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:01,560
fine,

446
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,759
I'll see you in court.

447
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm telling you,

448
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,120
if I wasn't raising funds right now,

449
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,480
and I can't afford being sued...

450
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,999
I'd...

451
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,999
Is the apartment I bought

452
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,480
in this building?

453
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,360
Why take me out

454
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,600
for ice cream all of a sudden?

455
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,679
To treat you of course.

456
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,120
You can't have it anymore

457
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
after the surgery.

458
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
How many days off are you taking?

459
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,519
I applied for my annual leave.

460
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,999
Does Yunjie know about this?

461
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,399
Of course not.

462
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,999
I must not let her know this.

463
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,519
Okay,

464
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,440
that makes it easy.

465
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,720
I already cleared out

466
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,440
a room for you.

467
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,759
Stay at my place

468
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,399
after the surgery.

469
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:35,999
I'll prepare for you

470
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,080
the best recovering meals.

471
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,560
Don't worry about anything.

472
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:39,799
Take some time off.

473
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,159
Stay at your place?

474
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,519
What about your brother-in-law?

475
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,999
Who cares about him?

476
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,320
He's lucky I'm not giving him a hard time.

477
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,519
If it wasn't for him,

478
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,679
you wouldn't be like this.

479
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,399
I'm telling you,

480
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,399
all men are like that.

481
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:50,919
Look at me.

482
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,720
I wouldn't be

483
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,039
having a second child,

484
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,080
if Jia wouldn't let me have my way.

485
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,879
Stop saying that.

486
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,799
Jia Haowen lets you have your way

487
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,799
because he loves you a lot.

488
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,679
He's a man after all.

489
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,480
If he wants to lay a hand on you,

490
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,240
it'll be a piece of cake for him.

491
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,080
Parents still don't know?

492
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,840
Did you say anything?

493
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:12,919
I don't think so.

494
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,919
I told Haowen

495
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,239
to not flatter my mom.

496
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,399
Can he be trusted?

497
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
I think he can.

498
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,000
If he dares to say a word,

499
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,239
I'll make him pay.

500
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,719
Let's eat.

501
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,280
Today, enjoy your meal to the fullest,

502
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:30,679
and eat to your heart's content.

503
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,479
Once you're satisfied, we go shopping,

504
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,560
and you can buy whatever you desire.

505
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,360
It'll all be on Jia.

506
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,639
How come would Jia marry you...

507
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:39,679
What?

508
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,040
Good for him.

509
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:42,800
Exactly.

510
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,399
Our family is great.

511
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,120
I'm telling you

512
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,360
he's making his ancestors proud.

513
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,320
Transitioning from clerical work to sales,

514
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,120
and becoming the top seller upon arrival,

515
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,919
I thought

516
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,719
that only happens

517
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,879
in TVs.

518
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,280
Ex-husband,

519
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,919
and playing the sympathy card.

520
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,080
Wu,

521
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,040
what do you have?

522
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,600
You have your thick glasses.

523
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,879
I don't care

524
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,919
how you sell your houses,

525
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,479
but as long as you do,

526
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:12,800
you're the top agent.

527
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,679
Our top agent

528
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,919
for this week

529
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,320
is Chen Wanzhen.

530
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,639
Wanzhen,

531
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,879
welcome

532
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:26,919
to our sales department.

533
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:27,879
What you made before

534
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:28,840
is already the past.

535
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,000
I hope you can make it happen again,

536
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,399
got it?

537
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,199
Yes.

538
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,919
I'll keep working.

539
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,479
Let's all give it our best together.

540
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:39,399
Guys,

541
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
for the top agent's title and bonus,

542
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:42,679
let's keep working.

543
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,479
That's all.

544
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,520
Wu,

545
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:47,520
keep working.

546
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,560
She got the best houses.

547
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,239
Mr. Qian.

548
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,639
We'll work with what's left.

549
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,159
I've developed

550
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,879
a new media marketing strategy.

551
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:55,679
Please have a look.

552
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,199
If you think it's feasible,

553
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,719
we can work

554
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,879
with new media companies.

555
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,919
Expand our sales channels

556
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,000
by leveraging the private traffic

557
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,479
of online influencers.

558
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,639
Interesting,

559
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,199
good job, Wanzhen.

560
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,399
You've some great ideas.

561
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,120
This is exactly what I have in mind.

562
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:09,600
You know,

563
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:10,959
I've talked to Mr. Zhang of Xinmiao

564
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,000
about cooperating.

565
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:13,239
I'll show him

566
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,000
your plan as well.

567
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,399
Xinmiao Media?

568
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,239
Yeah.

569
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,320
Blue Ocean works too.

570
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,239
No,

571
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,280
Xinmiao is great.

572
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,120
Come on,

573
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,320
I'll introduce you to some

574
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,879
important clients.

575
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,239
Me?

576
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:23,879
Yeah.

577
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
You've brought our company

578
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,479
some important clients.

579
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:27,280
Now it's my turn.

580
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:28,879
But...

581
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:30,840
Don't worry about them.

582
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,679
This is a benefit of the top agent.

583
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,520
You said

584
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,439
you wanted to

585
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,879
make a difference in the sales department.

586
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,239
Then make it big.

587
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,560
Make a big difference.

588
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,800
Make a big difference.

589
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,159
Li Yunjie,

590
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,040
Li Yunjie,

591
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:51,959
this drink is for you.

592
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,639
No,

593
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:54,560
no, thank you.

594
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,000
No.

595
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:56,760
Hurry up,

596
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,479
Yunjie,

597
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:58,239
get in the car.

598
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,800
Sir,

599
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,439
hurry,

600
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:00,959
let's go.

601
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,040
I'm here to help.

602
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
What's for dinner?

603
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,199
I bought a duck online yesterday,

604
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,439
and it arrived today.

605
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,879
So, Braised Ginger Duck for dinner.

606
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,199
Do you need any help?

607
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,399
Just leave it to me.

608
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,800
It's Jing.

609
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,639
Please help me take it.

610
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,600
Hello, Jing.

611
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,199
It's Meng'an.

612
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,879
Hi, I want to ask you,

613
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,959
do you remember your cousin,

614
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:35,760
Lanxiang?

615
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,360
Lanxiang?

616
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,040
Yeah.

617
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,239
She helped take care of Yunjie.

618
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,919
Yes.

619
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,879
She'd been in the city,

620
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,000
working as a nanny.

621
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,479
She came back a few years ago

622
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,560
when her son was taking the exam.

623
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:50,560
Now that he's at university,

624
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,600
she doesn't have much to do.

625
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:53,679
Your sister's

626
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:57,399
pregnant with a second child, right?

627
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
Ask her if she needs a nanny.

628
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,639
I'm telling you,

629
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:02,520
she's from our family.

630
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,879
There's nothing to worry about.

631
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,760
You're getting in other people's business.

632
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,120
Lanxiang asked me to help her find a job.

633
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,159
Jing,

634
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,320
Xin has already hired a nanny.

635
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,439
She doesn't need another.

636
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:18,399
Jing,

637
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,360
I'll check with her later.

638
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,520
Yeah, sure.

639
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,600
Meng'an is so nice.

640
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:25,919
Next time when something's up,

641
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,199
I'll talk to you.

642
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,439
Your son's at university too.

643
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:30,520
Why aren't you

644
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,639
working as a nanny?

645
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Xu,

646
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,080
that's it,

647
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,120
we'll leave you to it.

648
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,760
Don't be bothered with what she said.

649
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,919
How ridiculous.

650
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,239
Don't call Xin.

651
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
It's a bad idea.

652
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
Thank you.

653
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,000
Here we go.

654
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,560
Stop drinking the juice.

655
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,120
Here you go,

656
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,080
now pick a milk tea.

657
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,800
Which one do you want?

658
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,000
This one.

659
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,520
Here.

660
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:57,760
Thank you.

661
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,000
Check this out.

662
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,879
Tonglu Music Festival!

663
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,080
Yep.

664
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,679
Our favorite band is coming

665
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,719
to perform here.

666
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,600
Am I your best friend?

667
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,719
You're the best.

668
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
But...

669
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,919
But what?

670
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,760
Don't tell me you don't want to go.

671
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,199
No, I want to.

672
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,639
But my parents

673
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:23,959
might not let me.

674
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,800
Okay...

675
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,120
then I'll give it to someone else.

676
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:27,840
No.

677
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,800
Can you keep it for me?

678
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,199
But it opens this Saturday.

679
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,840
I know.

680
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:35,959
There's still time.

681
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:37,280
I'll think of something.

682
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,840
Please, He, you're the best.

683
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:41,800
Fine, it's yours.

684
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,959
Xin,

685
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,800
Meng'an,

686
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,320
I was about to call you.

687
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,159
I've scheduled an appointment for you

688
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,360
with a top-rated doctor this Saturday.

689
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,080
Can you make it?

690
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,439
Is it possible to get a sooner one?

691
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,479
Two days won't make much difference.

692
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,479
This doctor is the best,

693
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,439
and is only available on Saturday.

694
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,520
Plus, I've already booked it for you.

695
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:08,919
Okay then,

696
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,399
Saturday it is.

697
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,919
Thanks.

698
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,520
By the way, I called to ask you

699
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:17,679
after you have the second kid,

700
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,600
do you need a nanny?

701
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,320
Of course I do.

702
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,040
I'm definitely finding

703
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
the best nanny.

704
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,479
I have a recommendation.

705
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,639
Li Lin, he...

706
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,360
Li Lin's distant relative,

707
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,719
his cousin Lanxiang,

708
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:30,719
you've met her.

709
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,080
She's helped with Yunjie.

710
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,239
Oh, Lanxiang.

711
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,399
Just keep her

712
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:39,120
for yourself.

713
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,520
She's too good for me.

714
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,959
Why are you like that?

715
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:42,800
Why the irony?

716
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:43,719
Meng'an,

717
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,199
you forgot

718
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:46,159
what she was like

719
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,000
with Yunjie?

720
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,399
What was she like?

721
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:49,959
She was good.

722
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,040
She cooked,

723
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:52,600
did the laundry, looked after the kid.

724
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:53,479
She was good.

725
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,560
She was good with her job.

726
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,959
Stop right there.

727
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I remember it to this day.

728
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:58,560
She said,

729
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,959
educating Yunjie, a girl,

730
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,600
in so many subjects

731
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,840
is simply a waste of money.

732
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,639
When did she say that?

733
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:05,560
Why don't I remember?

734
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,719
Of course she said those things

735
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:08,080
behind your back.

736
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:09,719
I was still in school.

737
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,280
I remember it very clearly.

738
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,959
She was so sexist.

739
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,719
If I hire her, regardless of

740
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,000
whether I'm having a boy or a girl,

741
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,760
she'll lead the kid astray.

742
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,399
Okay, then don't hire her.

743
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:18,719
Forget about it.

744
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:19,399
Meng'an,

745
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,840
can you guess if

746
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm carrying a boy or a girl?

747
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,919
How should I know?

748
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,360
You'll find out once the baby is born.

749
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,439
I'm going to hang up now.

750
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:30,239
You...

751
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,199
Only thinking of yourself.

752
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,159
Once you're done with your questions,

753
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:35,959
you no longer show concern for me!

754
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,040
Are you a boy or a girl?

755
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,239
I think you're a girl.

756
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:47,280
You can wear all of my purses,

757
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,719
all of my diamonds.

758
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,159
I told you,

759
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,479
Xin wouldn't hire Lanxiang.

760
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,080
Don't listen to Jing.

761
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,360
I think Lanxiang

762
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
is satisfactory.

763
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,800
After all, Yunjie was the first child

764
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,760
she looked after

765
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,639
upon her first arrival in the city.

766
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,280
And it's been so many years,

767
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,800
she's definitely different.

768
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,800
Besides,

769
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,760
she works with

770
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,000
great dedication and effort,

771
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,120
and she's a family.

772
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,000
Otherwise, when Yunjie was young,

773
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
we would not dare

774
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,560
entrust her to Lanxiang

775
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,639
and went off to work.

776
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,320
That's true.

777
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,679
Hey,

778
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,959
what are you saying about me?

779
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,080
She scared me.

780
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,000
Welcome back.

781
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,560
Nothing bad about you.

782
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:23,479
We're talking about

783
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,120
your nanny Lanxiang.

784
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,919
Do you remember her?

785
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,439
How ungrateful.

786
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,919
Um...

787
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:37,360
Xin said

788
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,560
she scheduled a doctor's appointment

789
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,199
for me on Saturday.

790
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:43,679
Okay.

791
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,360
Then I'll tell Yunjie

792
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,560
that we

793
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,760
are going to your hometown that day.

794
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,919
Okay.

795
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,600
Up to you.

796
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:30,800
Yunjie,

797
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,760
this Saturday, your dad and I

798
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,800
are going back hometown.

799
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,560
You can go stay with your grandma,

800
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,080
okay?

801
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,399
Yeah!

802
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,520
That's awesome.

803
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,800
Are you that happy?

804
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:49,560
It's been... so long since I visited there.

805
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,000
I miss grandma so much.

806
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,040
Then

807
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,520
your dad and I

808
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,479
will take you there first.

809
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,600
No, it's fine.

810
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,719
I'll go myself.

811
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,520
I want to hang out with He Lu first.

812
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,360
In the evening,

813
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,399
I'll go have dinner there myself.

814
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:01,760
Is that okay?

815
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:03,360
Sure.

816
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,879
I'll leave it to you.

817
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:05,760
Okay, mom.

818
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,399
Time to do the homework.

819
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,120
Yes, Madam.

820
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,000
Wanwan, Zhenzhen,

821
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,520
hurry up. Get up and have breakfast.

822
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,959
You lazy bums, time to get up.

823
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:41,719
Look, the sun is up.

824
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,080
Little lazy piggies,

825
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,520
come on, get up.

826
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:47,919
I feel so cold.

827
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:48,479
Here,

828
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
stay under the cover.

829
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,080
What's wrong with you?

830
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,719
Mom, I want to puke.

831
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,760
Puke?

832
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,479
You feel so hot.

833
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,159
Stay under the cover.

834
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:03,959
Let's take your temperature.

835
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:07,280
Come,

836
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:08,520
let's see.

837
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,360
38.5 degrees.

838
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,800
Here, Wanwan.

839
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,280
You'll be fine.

840
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,879
Let me give you an anti-fever sticker.

841
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,600
Good girl.

842
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,080
Wanwan,

843
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:26,879
Wanwan,

844
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,120
You ok?

845
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,000
You feel so awful?

846
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,399
Mommy will

847
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,199
take you to the hospital,

848
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:37,760
okay?

849
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:38,760
Let's see what's wrong,

850
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,280
okay?

851
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,080
Let's get it checked out,

852
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:40,520
come on.

853
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,120
Be good.

854
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,959
Let's get up.

855
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,080
Put your clothes on.

856
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,719
Mommy, I don't want to go.

857
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,760
I don't want to get a shot.

858
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,959
Be good, sweetheart.

859
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,159
Be good, let's go to the hospital.

860
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:50,520
There won't be shots,

861
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:51,040
I promise.

862
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,719
Let's go for a check-up,

863
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:52,280
okay?

864
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,719
But I'm afraid of getting shots.

865
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,320
No shots,

866
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,520
only the check-up,

867
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,959
trust me.

868
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,439
What's wrong?

869
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,320
Are the kids sick?

870
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,840
Yeah,

871
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,159
they both have a fever.

872
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,919
I'm taking them to the hospital.

873
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,280
Mommy, I don't want to walk anymore.

874
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:02,959
Hold on.

875
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,120
Come on, get in my car.

876
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:04,800
I'll take you to the hospital.

877
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,800
Hold on, Zhenzhen.

878
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,280
Let's go.

879
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,959
Don't be afraid.

880
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:07,919
Be careful.

881
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,080
Get in the car.

882
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,600
You can get in the front.

883
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,719
Good girl.

884
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,280
Be careful.

885
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,560
Sit tight.

886
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,080
Please have a seat here,

887
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,120
and wait for me for a moment.

888
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,199
Give me the documents.

889
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:30,840
I'll go through the procedures.

890
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,239
I'll go.

891
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:33,560
It's fine.

892
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:34,719
Leave it to me.

893
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Do you still feel bad?

894
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:44,560
Do you want some water?

895
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,800
I can't have any.

896
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I don't want any.

897
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,959
Okay then.

898
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,439
Don't be afraid.

899
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,959
You'll be fine in just a moment.

900
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,639
I'm ready.

901
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,719
let's go, girls.

902
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:06,959
Who are you?

903
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,199
Forgot about me

904
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:11,959
already?

905
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,280
You're a doctor?

906
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,120
Yeah.

907
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,280
A real doctor or a fake one?

908
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:19,600
Have a guess.

909
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,679
Aren't you supposed to sleep in

910
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,959
on weekends?

911
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,280
He Lu and I

912
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,800
are having McDonald's

913
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,479
and then doing homework.

914
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,879
So early?

915
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,000
Breakfast has certain hours. Bye.

916
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,719
Lu.

917
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:55,719
Yunjie.

918
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,919
I'm here.

919
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,360
Let's go.

920
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,280
I'm free!

921
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,320
What're you looking at?

922
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,600
Your daughter.

923
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,000
Isn't she doing homework

924
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,280
with He Lu?

925
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,439
You saw how she was dressed.

926
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,600
Does it look like she's doing homework?

927
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,719
She's out having fun then.

928
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,679
You gave her money?

929
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,000
I gave her 300 yuan.

930
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,199
And she didn't tell you

931
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,320
what she's doing?

932
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,080
No.

933
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,439
She's not a kid anymore.

934
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:29,719
She can go wherever she wants.

935
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:31,399
If she doesn't want us to know,

936
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:32,120
we'll just act like

937
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,399
we don't know.

938
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,520
Even you won't tell me?

939
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Don't start with me.

940
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm not starting anything.

941
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,040
No,

942
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,879
don't get too fired up.

943
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,199
What I mean is

944
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,199
we should trust our child.

945
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,679
Of course,

946
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:47,159
you might think that because

947
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:48,080
your progesterone level is too high,

948
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,199
which makes you more sensitive.

949
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,760
I'll be fine after the surgery.

950
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,120
Excuse me.

951
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:39,159
My princesses,

952
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,719
you did so well.

953
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,040
Here are your rewards.

954
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,399
One for each of you, here you go.

955
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,560
From now on,

956
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,600
we're the bravest princesses,

957
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,679
and we'll fight the virus demon

958
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:47,879
till the end, right?

959
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah.

960
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:49,800
Sir,

961
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,159
you act like we're three or four.

962
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,080
You're really childish.

963
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:54,719
Aren't you a kid?

964
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:55,919
Of course not!

965
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,040
Right,

966
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,919
you're both little adults.

967
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,760
I'm the child here,

968
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,360
okay?

969
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,560
Keep your hands still.

970
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,479
Don't move them around.

971
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,320
I will go with your mom

972
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,199
to pay for the bills.

973
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,000
I can go myself.

974
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,040
I know where it is.

975
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,719
It's fine.

976
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:07,280
You see,

977
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,320
there aren't that many patients here.

978
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,439
You're my important guest.

979
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:10,399
Let's go.

980
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,439
Don't move around too much.

981
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,479
I'll be back in a minute.

982
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:13,959
Okay.

983
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,719
I'm sorry to bother you.

984
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,560
It's no big deal.

985
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,000
Wanzhen.

986
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
When you get back, make sure...

987
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:24,719
Where are the kids?

988
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,719
They are getting their infusion.

989
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:27,719
The fever is gone.

990
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,719
What happened?

991
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,760
Acute gastroenteritis.

992
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:31,000
What did you feed them?

993
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,959
You can't even look after

994
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:32,879
our children properly.

995
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:33,760
Sir,

996
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:34,719
please calm down.

997
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:35,000
Doctor.

998
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,000
Acute gastroenteritis

999
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,919
is a common illness.

1000
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:37,879
Your children had cream and seafood

1001
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,000
at school.

1002
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The fever is gone now.

1003
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,600
Don't worry.

1004
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,120
Thank you, doctor.

1005
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,000
No problem,

1006
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,199
it's my job.

1007
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,080
Aren't you

1008
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,199
her neighbor?

1009
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,120
Now you're the pediatrician?

1010
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,159
The doctor gave it to me.

1011
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,280
Wanwan, Zhenzhen.

1012
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:05,639
Dad.

1013
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,439
Dad.

1014
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,239
How're you feeling?

1015
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,280
Why did you just get here?

1016
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,719
I felt so awful.

1017
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,639
Dad,

1018
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,280
why didn't you

1019
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,719
come see us when we felt so terrible?

1020
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,639
Yeah.

1021
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,520
Dad is busy.

1022
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,719
You've

1023
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,000
made up your mind?

1024
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,759
I've

1025
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,279
already packed everything.

1026
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
The suitcases...?

1027
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,880
I think afterwards,

1028
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,159
I'll stay a few days

1029
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,880
at Mengxin's.

1030
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:31,719
Who is it?

1031
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,880
Mrs. He.

1032
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:38,679
Mr. Li.

1033
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,000
What's up?

1034
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Something's wrong.

1035
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,080
Let's talk inside.

1036
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,679
Mrs. He,

1037
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,159
what's wrong?

1038
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:46,719
Mrs. Xu, something's wrong.

1039
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:47,600
I can't

1040
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,440
get in touch with He Lu.

1041
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,920
I can't reach her on the phone.

1042
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,239
Can you

1043
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,319
try contacting Yunjie?

1044
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,120
Don't worry.

1045
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,159
Take a seat here.

1046
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:59,159
I saw them leaving together

1047
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,319
this morning.

1048
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,359
She said they were heading to McDonald's

1049
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,279
for breakfast

1050
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:04,239
They're probably fine.

1051
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,319
Why's her phone turned off then?

1052
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:22,279
They did it on purpose.

1053
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,839
Let's talk to Liu Siming's dad

1054
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,480
in the parents' group chat.

1055
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,120
Okay.

1056
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,000
Liu Siming?

1057
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:32,839
Did they

1058
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:34,040
go out with Liu Siming?

1059
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,759
Mrs. Sun,

1060
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,080
go ahead and take them upstairs.

1061
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:42,839
Okay.

1062
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:44,279
Goodbye, dad.

1063
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:45,600
Bye.

1064
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,120
Thank you.

1065
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,199
Thank you for bringing them back.

1066
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,960
Thank me? What's wrong with you?

1067
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,799
I'm their father.

1068
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,120
Well, speaking of...

1069
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,799
The guy at the hospital,

1070
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:56,560
why was he there?

1071
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,520
It can't be a coincidence.

1072
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,199
I've seen him

1073
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,400
three times in the past couple of days.

1074
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,440
He's the doctor, and he's the...

1075
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's stop this mess.

1076
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,920
Let's stop, okay?

1077
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,199
You see

1078
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,960
how bad this is for the kids,

1079
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:08,759
right?

1080
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,319
Yes, I know.

1081
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,759
I used to be busy with work,

1082
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:12,080
right?

1083
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,639
Didn't have the time for you and the kids.

1084
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,600
But you see today,

1085
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,279
when something's actually wrong,

1086
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,000
I need to come and fix it.

1087
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,199
I'm their father.

1088
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:18,920
Right?

1089
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,080
Lately, you've been

1090
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,319
walking all over me,

1091
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,000
and really gave me a hard time.

1092
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,319
It's enough.

1093
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,279
Let's call it a day,

1094
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,120
and I forgive you, okay?

1095
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,679
You can keep being Mrs. Yu,

1096
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,359
okay?

1097
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,480
Yu Hai, please stop.

1098
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:35,759
I've made up my mind.

1099
00:37:35,759 --> 00:37:37,120
This isn't something you can change

1100
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,040
just by saying some kind words.

1101
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,799
No, look,

1102
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,480
I've even put my ring back on.

1103
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,520
One minute,

1104
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,719
wait,

1105
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,359
wait.

1106
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,000
Hello,

1107
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,600
the meeting, I know!

1108
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,440
I went to the hospital

1109
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,520
to see my kids.

1110
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,920
Yeah?

1111
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,759
Okay, I'm on my way back.

1112
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,560
I'm sorry.

1113
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,759
It's fine.

1114
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,120
Liu Siming.

1115
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,040
Just you wait.

1116
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:37,440
Hello, the number you have dialed

1117
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:39,319
cannot be reached at this time.

1118
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,319
Come, this way.

1119
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,639
Classical music is better after all.

1120
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,520
No, it's got to be folk.

1121
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,159
Li Yunjie,

1122
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,440
Li Yunjie,

1123
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:51,520
Li Yunjie.

1124
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,279
He's looking for us?

1125
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Quick, take cover!

1126
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Excuse me.

1127
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,920
Sorry.

1128
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,080
Excuse me.

1129
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,639
Mr. Li,

1130
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,040
I found them.

1131
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:07,839
I'll put her on the phone.

1132
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,639
Excuse me.

1133
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,279
Excuse me.

1134
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:11,440
Excuse me.

1135
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:13,520
Sorry.

1136
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:15,120
Sorry.

1137
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,080
It's fine.

1138
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,279
Sorry.

1139
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:17,960
Doesn't matter.

1140
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,960
Excuse me.

1141
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:24,440
Liu Siming,

1142
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,839
what do you want from us?

1143
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,440
I'm keeping you safe.

1144
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,639
I don't need you to.

1145
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,639
My ice cream fell off.

1146
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,359
Are you paying me back?

1147
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:31,440
Li Yunjie,

1148
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:32,520
your dad's looking for you.

1149
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,600
He Lu,

1150
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,679
and your mom.

1151
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,520
Why did you turn your phone off

1152
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,719
when you're out?

1153
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,239
They'll be here soon.

1154
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,319
Be prepared for what to tell them.

1155
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,639
You, traitor!

1156
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,359
They are here.

1157
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,040
Be nice to Lu.

1158
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,440
Rui just got back from home.

1159
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,839
She's been upset about it.

1160
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,080
He Lu, get up.

1161
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,600
You truly drive me crazy.

1162
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:07,799
Let go of me.

1163
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,960
He Lu, come here.

1164
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:12,839
Good luck.

1165
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,520
Having the music festival here

1166
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:15,960
is good,

1167
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,880
just a bit too far.

1168
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,560
If you'd told me earlier,

1169
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,120
I would've wanted to see it too.

1170
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
How much is a ticket?

1171
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:22,520
Is it a lot?

1172
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,560
Enough.

1173
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,239
You've learned to lie now?

1174
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,480
I... I didn't lie to you.

1175
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,759
You didn't lie?

1176
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,359
Didn't you say you were having breakfast

1177
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,679
with He Lu at McDonald's?

1178
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,679
Is this McDonald's?

1179
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,960
And you're telling this isn't a lie?

1180
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,560
If you didn't lie,

1181
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,880
why won't you look at me?

1182
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,359
Where's that usual defiance of yours?

1183
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,639
If I look at you,

1184
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,679
you'll say I'm being disrespectful.

1185
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,960
And I did say

1186
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,839
I wanted to hang out with He Lu in the day

1187
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,560
and go back to grandma's for dinner.

1188
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,480
What?

1189
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,960
You're playing with words here?

1190
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,120
Calm down.

1191
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,440
Yunjie,

1192
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,120
the music festival is pretty good,

1193
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,960
and It's good that you like music.

1194
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,759
Your mom is not against that.

1195
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,279
What I'm saying is

1196
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:20,359
if you told her about it,

1197
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,120
no one would stop you from going,

1198
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:23,040
right?

1199
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,080
Your mom is worried about you,

1200
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,239
two girls, so far from home.

1201
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:28,199
You went out,

1202
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,319
without taking your phone.

1203
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,759
What if something goes wrong?

1204
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,480
Mr. Li,

1205
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,040
nothing would go wrong.

1206
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,880
I'm here.

1207
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,920
I'll keep them safe.

1208
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,839
Liu Siming, thank you for that.

1209
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,040
We're

1210
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,920
having a conversation as a family,

1211
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,759
okay?

1212
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:41,359
Okay, Mr. Li.

1213
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,040
Mom,

1214
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,440
what happened today,

1215
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,600
it's my fault.

1216
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm sorry.

1217
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,040
I wanted to tell you the truth,

1218
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,400
but I heard you talking about

1219
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,880
going back home to the hospital,

1220
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,920
and having me go stay with grandma.

1221
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,359
I, I...

1222
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,279
You saw your chance, didn't you?

1223
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,600
What's the point in that?

1224
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
Tell me,

1225
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,239
have we ever denied your request

1226
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,679
to go out and have fun?

1227
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,239
Didn't you go every time?

1228
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,120
We understand that

1229
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,440
you're under a lot of pressure

1230
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,239
from your studies,

1231
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,040
and want to go out and have a break.

1232
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,839
We've always supported you.

1233
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,279
Okay, that's it.

1234
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,639
We're in public.

1235
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,480
Is it your fault?

1236
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,319
Mom, it's my fault.

1237
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:31,759
I'm sorry.

1238
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:33,080
I shouldn't have lied.

1239
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,600
I'll never lie to you again,

1240
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,080
mom.

1241
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,120
Didn't you say

1242
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,719
you were going to take mom

1243
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,279
to the hospital back home?

1244
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:45,639
Sorry, I upset your plan.

1245
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:46,880
Yeah, that's right.
