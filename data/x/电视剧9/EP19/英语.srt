Just in Time EP19

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,800
Help?

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,680
Please help.

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,680
Let's go!

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Right now.

7
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,760
Listen to me.

8
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
Who's gone?

9
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,559
Meng'an.

10
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,719
She's in a hurry.

11
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,360
Before going to work,

12
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
she'll pay a visit to her father.

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,200
No way!

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,960
She hasn't taken the medicine!

15
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,439
She won't!

16
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,719
I... I'll take it.

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,200
Nonsense!

18
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
You take it for what?

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,999
Let me tell you.

20
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,520
Inform me as soon as she's back.

21
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,759
I'll boil the medicine for her.

22
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,360
Two times a day.

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,999
Adhere strictly to my prescription.

24
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,159
Do you hear me?

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,719
See?

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,559
The dosage is for half a month.

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,319
Why didn't you knock the door?

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,480
For what?

29
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,960
You're not bare to the waist.

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,159
I'm your sister.

31
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,080
What do you want?

32
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,319
Where are you going?

33
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,279
Going for work!

34
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,719
Get dressed,

35
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,999
and talk with me.

36
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,879
Five minutes.

37
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:16,559
Hurry up.

38
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:17,400
Sit down.

39
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,120
Just spit it out.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,400
Sit down!

41
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,200
Sis,

42
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm in my forties.

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,080
Don't treat me like a kid!

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,800
But you'll always be my brother.

45
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:29,920
Just say it.

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,879
You say first.

47
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,319
Say what?

48
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,400
Our family maxim.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,960
Parental and fraternal bonds

50
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,960
unite family members all.

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,159
Exactly!

52
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,439
A peaceful family will be prosperous,

53
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,159
right?

54
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,920
Our mother died young,

55
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,120
and father had to run the clinic alone.

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
All household chores

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,960
had been my responsibility.

58
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,279
Before our father passed away,

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
he asked Ouyang to marry into our family.

60
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,599
He ordered me

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,920
to discipline you,

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,120
so that you would be a talent.

63
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,640
You didn't disappoint us.

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,999
I never worried about your study.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,279
Afterwards,

66
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,520
you married Meng'an, a good wife.

67
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,240
See?

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,360
What a happy life!

69
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,719
For these years,

70
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,879
I've never disturbed your life.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,599
Well,

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
what's your key point?

73
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,960
It's the key period now.

74
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,480
The key period of what?

75
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,680
It's the key period of our Li family

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,079
to raise offspring now.

77
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,040
Get it?

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,319
There are not many

79
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,240
key periods in one's life.

80
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,800
We can only count them

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,360
with four fingers.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,920
Birth,

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,360
age,

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:38,920
illness,

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,439
and death.

86
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,800
Birth ranks the first.

87
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,399
Li Lin,

88
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,199
you should pick up your spirits!

89
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,879
Why? Do I look discouraged?

90
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,079
Why must I pick up my spirits?

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,959
I'm not pregnant!

92
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:50,879
Don't beat around the bush!

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,360
Though Meng'an is pregnant,

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,879
you don't want to keep the baby,

95
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,360
do you?

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,319
Of course we'll keep the baby!

97
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:57,959
From whom did you hear the rumor?

98
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,600
It's none of your business.

99
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,759
I'll forget about the truth

100
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,600
that you didn't tell me.

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
I understand that you want to

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,999
hide it away from me.

103
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,600
In our opinion,

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600
let nature take its course.

105
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,480
The baby appears unexpectedly.

106
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,360
If God keeps it,

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,959
we'll keep it;

108
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,120
if it's not strong enough,

109
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,399
we have no other choice.

110
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,879
How come?

111
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,600
Our Li Family has studied

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,480
TCM for generations.

113
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,280
No doubt we have choices!

114
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,160
It is true that

115
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,199
we've studied TCM for long,

116
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,319
but you're not a doctor.

117
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,319
Do you have ways to keep the baby?

118
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,759
I am the way.

119
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,280
I've arranged everything properly.

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,600
I arranged Lanxiang

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,920
to look after your father-in-law.

122
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
As for me,

123
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,160
I'll stay here

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
to look after you.

125
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,280
You?

126
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,439
Yes.

127
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,920
Stay here?

128
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes.

129
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,319
I have my duty to stay here,

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,079
which is to help the Li Family

131
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,680
to

132
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,360
raise

133
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,920
the

134
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,680
offspring!

135
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,319
What takes you so long?

136
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,680
I'm going late for work.

137
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,800
You ran away,

138
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,079
but I failed.

139
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,519
She was disciplining me back there.

140
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,480
I knew it.

141
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,480
She's prepared

142
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,680
to stay in our house.

143
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,800
Lanxiang is unreliable!

144
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,840
Forget it.

145
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,399
Anyway,

146
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,759
we can face the challenge.

147
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,519
Don't worry.

148
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,480
I'll let her go back.

149
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:32,800
Is it appropriate?

150
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,280
I think so.

151
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,959
When you gave birth to Yunjie,

152
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,480
she was in our house, remember?

153
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,720
Like a backseat driver.

154
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,120
Weren't you angry?

155
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,120
I was.

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,120
See?

157
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,559
But we were young back then.

158
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:46,840
In the twenties,

159
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,600
we had big egos.

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
Things are different now.

161
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,600
If someone can give me a hand now,

162
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,120
I'll be glad.

163
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
Besides, back then,

164
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,360
some of her words made sense.

165
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,999
She's the head nurse, anyway.

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,240
How ridiculous!

167
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,160
Working in her own clinic,

168
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,319
she can be the head of clinic!

169
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,360
Well,

170
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,519
I'm afraid she'll cause trouble

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,319
to you.

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,399
I admit she's a good person,

173
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
but disregards social distance.

174
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,319
While I was getting myself dressed,

175
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,199
she came in

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,319
without knocking on the door,

177
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,199
giving me a start.

178
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,639
So embarrassing!

179
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
If you were not pregnant,

180
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,240
she could live here

181
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,559
as long as she wished.

182
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,519
It doesn't matter,

183
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,999
though sometimes she might be bossy.

184
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Things are different now

185
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,559
since a baby comes.

186
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,120
If in case that

187
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,879
something wrong happens to you,

188
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,240
let alone going to work,

189
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,079
she won't even allow you to go out!

190
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,800
Don't you trust me?

191
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,319
I do, I do.

192
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,680
In that case,

193
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,680
you try to ask her.

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,160
Fine.

195
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,120
I'll have a try.

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,920
Don't worry.

197
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,399
I won't infuriate her.

198
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
If she doesn't want to leave,

199
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,559
don't be too tough.

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,559
I won't.

201
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,480
Unlike her,

202
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,399
I know the limit.

203
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,680
The job can't be lost!

204
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,639
How dare you bring a phone here?

205
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,680
I'll take it!

206
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,519
My heart missed a beat!

207
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,639
Last night,

208
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,199
were it not me saving the situation,

209
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,240
my mother might give up

210
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,120
the baby!

211
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,439
Don't you believe me?

212
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,920
Do you know how I told my mother?

213
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,800
Last night,

214
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,439
my parents didn't

215
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:40,440
come back until midnight.

216
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,960
I was waiting in the living room.

217
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,159
Even so, my mother scolded me,

218
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,480
"Good for you, Li Yunjie!

219
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,759
How dare you stay up late?"

220
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,399
Do you know what I said?

221
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,200
What did you say?

222
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,360
"Woman,

223
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,799
I have a word with you.

224
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,679
The baby in your womb

225
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,679
must be kept.

226
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,759
Dad dares not tell you,

227
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,799
but I do.

228
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,759
I won't make any recession,

229
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,159
and it all depends on your attitude."

230
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,159
What did your mom say?

231
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,480
My mom said,

232
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,879
"Good for you, Li Yunjie!

233
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,999
How dare you

234
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,120
speak to me like that?"

235
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,279
But she promised me eventually.

236
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,320
In our home,

237
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
my dad's not a decision-maker,

238
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,960
and he discusses everything with her.

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,120
How tiring!

240
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,720
You're so naive!

241
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,519
Afterwards,

242
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,519
your life will be miserable.

243
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,879
Stop being so serious!

244
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,679
The baby is my little sister.

245
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,679
Just leave it to me.

246
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,080
How do you know it's a she?

247
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,399
What if it's a he?

248
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,399
You are doomed to be miserable!

249
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,080
It'll be fine.

250
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,600
My dad will be my supporter.

251
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,639
Anyway,

252
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,960
everything at home

253
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,399
is under my control.

254
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,639
Stop bragging!

255
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,720
Under your control?

256
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,919
Woman, I have a word with you!

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm so afraid!

258
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,679
I'm so afraid!

259
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,879
Stop it!

260
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,120
Little Watermelon, cheer up!

261
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:56,759
Cheer up!

262
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:57,639
Little Watermelon,

263
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,560
mom's visiting you.

264
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,039
Your mom is a beauty.

265
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,679
Once you can see her,

266
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,080
you'll be a beauty yourself!

267
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,720
Cheer up, Little Watermelon!

268
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,480
Little Watermelon?

269
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,080
Who gave her such a name?

270
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,919
Darling,

271
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,879
the name is given by Xiongxiong.

272
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,360
Given such a name,

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
She'll be easily raised.

274
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,679
Our baby is a girl,

275
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,919
so it sounds terrible

276
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,879
to be called Little Watermelon!

277
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Sweet.

278
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,759
Sweet girl.

279
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,720
Darling,

280
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,200
does your wound hurt?

281
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,679
Darling,

282
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm so sorry.

283
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,080
So sorry about that.

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,039
It's all my fault.

285
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,879
Darling.

286
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,960
If you didn't sign your name,

287
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,039
my belly wouldn't have suffered!

288
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,999
Darling,

289
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,799
I had no gut to sign my name.

290
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,679
Let me tell you,

291
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,279
it was your sister.

292
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,080
You didn't sign your name?

293
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,320
I... I just offered up

294
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,639
a hand.

295
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,919
Darling.

296
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,600
Darling.

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,279
I'm so sorry.

298
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,999
Take care. It's my fault.

299
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,960
Why so mysterious?

300
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,560
Why not talk about it

301
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,039
in our office?

302
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,600
I decided

303
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,080
to tell Mr. Zhang the truth.

304
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,679
Haven't we decided

305
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,679
not to tell him?

306
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:32,120
Sooner or later.

307
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,879
In these days,

308
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,080
I was wondering

309
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,399
if I should keep the baby.

310
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,320
But my father was ill,

311
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,600
and my sister gave a premature birth,

312
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,480
which made me realize

313
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
how vulnerable life is.

314
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
Every life

315
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,200
should be respected,

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,679
and taken good care of,

317
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,159
so Li Lin and I

318
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,399
made a deal

319
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,120
to keep the baby

320
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,600
the God gave us.

321
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,639
Though we are not rich,

322
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,200
and our energy has decreased,

323
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,879
we're determined to

324
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,999
have a try.

325
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,279
I support you.

326
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,480
We should really

327
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,440
think about the issue now.

328
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,320
What's your idea?

329
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,240
I have only one underling,

330
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,039
who is Ling Meichuan.

331
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,879
If I tell Mr. Zhang the truth,

332
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,600
he'll definitely

333
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,879
find another Deputy Director,

334
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,399
whose professional ability

335
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,279
will be great.

336
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,840
Apparently,

337
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,159
there is no candidate

338
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,679
for such a position.

339
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,999
Who do you think will be?

340
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,080
I don't know.

341
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,240
Whoever he or she is,

342
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,320
it must be guaranteed that

343
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,999
after my maternity leave,

344
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,440
I can still

345
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
keep my position.

346
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,480
I love it when you're competitive.

347
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,999
But it's not the right time

348
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,960
to be competitive.

349
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
What I need to do now is

350
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,639
mapping out a strategy,

351
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,919
biding my time,

352
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
and arranging everything well.

353
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,399
I want to discuss with you

354
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,679
if neither of the Deputy Directors

355
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,120
is my underling,

356
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,240
I'll need another hand

357
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,999
to help me stabilize my work.

358
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,679
I'm wondering

359
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,639
if it is possible for him

360
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,080
to create a position

361
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,120
for my assistant.

362
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,480
Director Assistant!

363
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,200
I'll ask Wanzhen.

364
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,639
Wanzhen,

365
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,399
may I ask you a question?

366
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,039
Go ahead.

367
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,960
Did you buy the financial product

368
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,799
of our company?

369
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,039
What's the matter?

370
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,840
My boyfriend and I

371
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,320
tend to get some money for it,

372
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,279
so I'm curious about

373
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,799
how much everyone bought.

374
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,039
It's hard to earn money now.

375
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,879
Don't put all your eggs

376
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,080
into one basket.

377
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,440
In fact,

378
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,799
we want to use the earned money

379
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,600
to buy a car.

380
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,240
How can I make it clear?

381
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,799
The investment product

382
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,039
has risks.

383
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,720
I suggest you

384
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
to invest sensibly.

385
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,919
Fine, I get it.

386
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,919
Thank you, Wanzhen.

387
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,840
Why do you still work during a break?

388
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,480
Wanzhen,

389
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,720
how I envy you

390
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,679
for being so wealthy!

391
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,080
Financial product is nothing to you,

392
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,600
but the only way for us ordinary people

393
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,999
to make a fortune.

394
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,799
We can never compare with you,

395
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,919
a wealthy wife

396
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,879
divorcing a tyrant!

397
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,200
I've worked in the company

398
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,240
for over five years,

399
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,399
so I quite know

400
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,480
the company.

401
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,879
The yield you despise

402
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,919
means a lot to us,

403
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,320
which is a great amount.

404
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,679
It's a real estate company,

405
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,039
and selling houses is our duty.

406
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,639
If you don't need to sale,

407
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,279
why don't you

408
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,560
give me some clients

409
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,480
who can afford

410
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,519
buying real estate?

411
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,039
I want to sale.

412
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,200
If you really want to sell houses,

413
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,679
I can introduce some to you.

414
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,720
If

415
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,560
you want to sell financial products,

416
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,360
let me tell you,

417
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,519
no way.

418
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,360
Forget about it.

419
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,799
How could you give up

420
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,679
the rich clients to me?

421
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,080
You're holding them tightly,

422
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,840
even Mr. Qian.

423
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,759
As for me,

424
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,279
I'll earn the money

425
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,840
you despise!

426
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,639
Come on,

427
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,560
it's my treat.

428
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,840
Darling,

429
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,320
could you check how much money

430
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,440
do we have in our deposit card?

431
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
It's a merit, of course!

432
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
Fine, I'll touch you later.

433
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,240
I'll hang up.

434
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,240
Okay.

435
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,720
Come here.

436
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,080
Mr. Sun.

437
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,159
I'm looking for you.

438
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,080
Please have a seat.

439
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,720
Wanzhen,

440
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,440
your major is finance,

441
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,879
so I want you to have a look

442
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,679
at the financial product

443
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,240
in our company.

444
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,679
I want to buy some.

445
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,919
The quota can't ignore

446
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,480
Department of Administration, right?

447
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,600
Mr. Sun,

448
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,919
I suggest you

449
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:48,960
not to buy it.

450
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:49,879
Why not?

451
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,600
Vice Manager Qian has bought a lot,

452
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
as well as other top managers.

453
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,120
It's very profitable!

454
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,240
Don't worry.

455
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,679
Our company won't bear any crisis.

456
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,360
The financial product

457
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,519
is based on

458
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,840
the individual asset ratio.

459
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,999
Can you imagine their income?

460
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,840
It doesn't work for ordinary people!

461
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,639
Well, I've promised

462
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,919
the order given by Mr. Qian.

463
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,480
We have to buy some.

464
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:13,759
You see,

465
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,120
those top managers

466
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,639
have earned quite a lot,

467
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,320
so we can't fall behind, can we?

468
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,039
How about that?

469
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,879
Mr. Sun,

470
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,159
do we have

471
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,440
any financial statement

472
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,159
in previous years?

473
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,799
They're all here.

474
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,639
I'll check it out,

475
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,240
and make a judgment, okay?

476
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,080
No problem.

477
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,639
They're all here.

478
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,240
Two years' statements.

479
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,600
I've heard that

480
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,120
Mr. Qian gave you a hard time

481
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,560
for not buying any product.

482
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,519
That's not true.

483
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,799
Mr. Qian

484
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,519
gave me time to consider.

485
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,080
He permits me to buy it

486
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,720
after I finish my securities training.

487
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,679
What a nerd you are!

488
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,560
Don't you see?

489
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,840
Your major is finance.

490
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,600
Since I've studied securities,

491
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,360
I'm more cautious about it

492
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,879
before I figure everything out.

493
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,120
Okay, keep it.

494
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,320
Think about it.

495
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Hello, Grace.

496
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,520
May I ask you a question?

497
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
About the finance of real estate.

498
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,239
Do you have any time?

499
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,679
You're pregnant!

500
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,280
Really?

501
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,439
Mr. Zhang,

502
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,080
it's good news.

503
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,560
It means our company

504
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,639
is a blessed place!

505
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,600
What's wrong with you?

506
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,120
I mean,

507
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,000
in your age, it's...

508
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,959
a high risk.

509
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,639
Are you going to keep it?

510
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,159
Of course.

511
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,719
In her age,

512
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:48,959
what a bless

513
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,239
to have a second baby!

514
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,280
That's right.

515
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,800
Well,

516
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,320
sorry.

517
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
Should I congratulate you?

518
00:17:58,879 --> 00:17:59,760
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

519
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,399
But our company

520
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
has so many things to do.

521
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,439
What should we do...

522
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,560
to continue our work?

523
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,679
What's your idea?

524
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,719
I do have an idea,

525
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,120
so I asked Rachel

526
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,879
to discuss with you about it.

527
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,639
I see.

528
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,719
Well,

529
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
in my age,

530
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,479
it's true to be hard

531
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,399
to be pregnant,

532
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,679
and the energy cannot compare

533
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,919
with that before.

534
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,000
In my opinion,

535
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,280
rather than doing my original work,

536
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:32,879
I prefer to

537
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:33,959
resign.

538
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,159
Nice try!

539
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,679
Let alone the six-month work time,

540
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,040
the maternity leave is

541
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,280
mere 128 days.

542
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,760
If you resign now,

543
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,560
you're putting Mr. Zhang

544
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,879
in a big trouble!

545
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,959
How come?

546
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,600
You see,

547
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,639
the lactation period

548
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,520
is protected by the law.

549
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,840
If you leave now,

550
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,280
not only is the law violated,

551
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,560
but also the reputation

552
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,679
of Mr. Zhang

553
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,479
will be ruined!

554
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,600
Let me tell you,

555
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,879
no way for you to resign!

556
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,439
Is that true?

557
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,159
Then that's a big problem.

558
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,280
Although we have a Deputy Director

559
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,280
in the Content Department,

560
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,320
Meichuan

561
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,320
has never done content

562
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,159
all through the years.

563
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,760
I'll try my best to help her grow.

564
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:27,919
But,

565
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,239
no matter how hard I try,

566
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,360
it will take long for her

567
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,879
to fully carry the burden.

568
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,919
Then recruit a new one.

569
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,639
What?

570
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,159
A Deputy Director?

571
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,959
If you hire another Deputy Director,

572
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,560
he or she must be

573
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,320
familiar with content,

574
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,320
and have good professional ability.

575
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,239
I consent to what Mr. Zhang said.

576
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,959
But there's something else,

577
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,199
which is,

578
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,520
two Deputy Directors,

579
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,479
with one not familiar with work,

580
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,000
while the other not familiar to us,

581
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,959
isn't it unstable

582
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,360
if the work

583
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
starts to unravel?

584
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,239
How about

585
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,760
choosing one from our company?

586
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,719
At least, from the perspective of

587
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,879
fidelity, credibility

588
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,120
and work proficiency,

589
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,879
it will be much more reliable.

590
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,159
How about Jiaojiao?

591
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:32,959
That girl?

592
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,879
I think Yu is also a good choice.

593
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,479
For God's sake!

594
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,639
Neither can't even compete with Mu!

595
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,479
Then choose Mu.

596
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,360
Deputy Director is too much for him.

597
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,679
It's appropriate for him

598
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,239
to work more with higher salary.

599
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,879
I think,

600
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,479
he can assist two Deputy Directors.

601
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:54,840
How about Director Assistant?

602
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,439
What do you think, Mr. Zhang?

603
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,360
Then choose Mu.

604
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,639
We'll arrange that.

605
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,280
Have a good rest!

606
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,479
Is that your scheme?

607
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,320
Have a rest!

608
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,439
Let's go.

609
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,120
Wendy?

610
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,120
Why are you here?

611
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,679
I'm looking for Grace.

612
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,560
Do you have any plan

613
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280
to be back in our financial industry?

614
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,159
Yes.

615
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,080
Marvelous!

616
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,040
What are you waiting for?

617
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,040
Come to me as soon as you can.

618
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,639
I need trusted advisors.

619
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,159
I've learnt a few about your company.

620
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,439
Like a dark horse since the beginning,

621
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,239
you have led the investment

622
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,120
of new sales,

623
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,000
manufacture,

624
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,479
and Cultural and Creative Industries,

625
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,560
which are all unicorn companies.

626
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,959
You've done adequate work!

627
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,679
Work for me.

628
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,199
My email is on my business card,

629
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,560
and the headhunter is acquainted

630
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,120
with my HR.

631
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,479
I know, Mr. Zhou.

632
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,120
I'm making preparations

633
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,919
for an opportunity.

634
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,719
What for?

635
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,439
One can never be well prepared.

636
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,879
A chance already appears.

637
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,760
I hope you can

638
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,719
accept my invitation.

639
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,719
I'm preparing

640
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,080
for a certificate.

641
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,719
As soon as I get it,

642
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,520
I'll knock on the gate of Yaohui Co..

643
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:40,479
Alright.

644
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,560
I'll be waiting for your knock.

645
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,840
Okay.

646
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,479
Goodbye.

647
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,439
Wanzhen.

648
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,399
The materials you need.

649
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,280
Thank you.

650
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,239
The materials

651
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,399
are disclosed financial statements

652
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:01,959
in the financial market.

653
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:02,919
Excellent!

654
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,080
What do you need them for?

655
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,320
I want to know

656
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:08,080
the financial condition

657
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,439
of Huaxing Real Estate Co..

658
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,560
So you intend to

659
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,879
be back to finance.

660
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,320
When are you coming back?

661
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,080
Soon.

662
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:17,959
Everything's here.

663
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,639
Thank you.

664
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:19,600
You're welcome.

665
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,959
I feel pity for the boss.

666
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:28,120
Is there any company

667
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,719
like ours?

668
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:32,479
Probably.

669
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,280
It's said that the boss

670
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,600
is working for the employees.

671
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,520
He consents to me

672
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,000
every time I make a proposal.

673
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,879
Oh, I feel pity for him.

674
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,719
Who came up with the idea?

675
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,080
Whom am I doing this for?

676
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,600
It's all for you.

677
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,760
Can he recognize it?

678
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,719
No matter how,

679
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:57,959
a deal is a deal.

680
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm doing this for our company.

681
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,719
I have professional integrity!

682
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,520
You didn't let him down.

683
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
Of course.

684
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,760
Does it mean

685
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:14,679
you'll retreat to the back line?

686
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,199
Not bad.

687
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You'll have time to have a rest.

688
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,919
It's time to raise your soldiers.

689
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,320
You can't always in the front line.

690
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,360
What a good chance

691
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,199
to rest.

692
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,600
I suddenly feel down.

693
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,719
Why do I feel so?

694
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,520
Is it because I can't adapt to it?

695
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,399
Everything

696
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,360
needs time to adjust.

697
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,080
It won't take too long.

698
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,919
How long will it be?

699
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:55,199
Yummy!

700
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,479
I'm glad you like it.

701
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,120
Are you sure I can eat this?

702
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,479
As long as it's not too much.

703
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,159
You'll feel good after eating sweets,

704
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,679
which is good for your recovery.

705
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,520
That's true.

706
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,959
I desire for the sweets,

707
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,520
but I'm not allowed here.

708
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,679
They only give me

709
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,879
plain food.

710
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,919
Yuck!

711
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,040
Oh, my darling.

712
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,719
My baby was sent to

713
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,280
thermostatic chamber after birth.

714
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,399
I don't know

715
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,479
if she can make it.

716
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,800
I feel so worried!

717
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:32,959
Don't worry.

718
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,280
Being sent to the thermostatic chamber

719
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,199
enables her to be taken good care of.

720
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:38,760
Besides, we have nurses.

721
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,919
When I gave birth to

722
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,080
Wanwan and Zhenzhen,

723
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,320
each twin

724
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,840
was only 1.5 kilograms,

725
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,199
so they were also sent there.

726
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,399
I was extremely worried back then,

727
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,600
but look at them now.

728
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,560
They can't be

729
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,719
healthy enough!

730
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,199
The second child

731
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,479
brought me a different attitude.

732
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,679
I lost my courage now.

733
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,560
When I gave birth to Xiongxiong,

734
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,919
how reckless I was!

735
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,399
And luckily, of course,

736
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:00,959
he's healthy,

737
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,479
and I recovered soon.

738
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,719
But now,

739
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:06,159
the instant I think of my daughter,

740
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:06,959
lying in the chamber

741
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,159
on her own,

742
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:09,679
with no one caressing her,

743
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,600
I feel so painful!

744
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,879
I can't agree more.

745
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:14,760
Your postpartum hormone level

746
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
is unstable now,

747
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,959
so you're too worried.

748
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
With so many doctors and nurses,

749
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
you have no reason to worry.

750
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,360
The most important thing

751
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,600
is to cheer yourself up,

752
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
so as to recover soon.

753
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,479
Keep a good mood.

754
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:29,879
A good mood.

755
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,479
If there's anything you want to eat,

756
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,679
tell me secretly,

757
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,080
and I'll bring them quietly.

758
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,320
My uncle,

759
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,000
have more bananas.

760
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,879
Good for your defecation.

761
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,760
Come on.

762
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:44,679
Open your mouth.

763
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,320
There. Have more fruit.

764
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:49,919
Come on.

765
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:51,199
Yes.

766
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:55,560
Is that all?

767
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,600
My uncle,

768
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,000
no way.

769
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Turn your head to me.

770
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,280
We have to eat it.

771
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,280
Or you'll suffer a lot

772
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,439
if you can't poop,

773
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,360
which breaks my heart!

774
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
It's good for defecation.

775
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,719
Don't be capricious.

776
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,320
By taking adequate nutrition,

777
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,879
you can recover sooner.

778
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,280
Lanxiang.

779
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:16,120
Oh, Meng'an.

780
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,879
Open your mouth.

781
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,239
Did you have your breakfast?

782
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:20,080
Yes, I did.

783
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:20,800
You did?

784
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,959
So did my father?

785
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:22,639
Yes, he did.

786
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:23,080
He did?

787
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,000
He's eating fruit now.

788
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,719
Have more.

789
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:28,560
I'll do this.

790
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:31,520
Okay.

791
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,600
Do you want to stop?

792
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:37,639
We'll stop now.

793
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,159
Take it away.

794
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:39,879
Okay, fine.

795
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:41,560
Take it off.

796
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:42,560
Take it off.

797
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,560
Spit it out.

798
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,800
I know.

799
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,399
That's too much!

800
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:09,719
Don't be angry with her.

801
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:11,719
She has never attended to patients.

802
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:13,080
I'll tell her later

803
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,560
to feed you more slowly.

804
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,719
She used to look after Yunjie

805
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,919
very well.

806
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:20,199
I'll let her

807
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,679
look after you like that,

808
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,479
okay?

809
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Have you heard of it?

810
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,840
Mengxin had another baby.

811
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,679
A girl.

812
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,879
Over 2.5 kilograms.

813
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,560
Her skin's so fair,

814
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,919
and her eyes are big,

815
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,399
like Mengxin when she was little.

816
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,639
Xiongxiong

817
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,280
gave her an infant name,

818
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,360
called Little Watermelon.

819
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,080
He said

820
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,439
the Little Watermelon is sweet.

821
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,520
Are you glad now?

822
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,040
Keep it.

823
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,320
Keep it.

824
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:08,840
Are you sure?

825
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,159
How can I keep it with you being ill?

826
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,679
Li Lin and I

827
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,800
are both working.

828
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,479
How can we take care of the baby?

829
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,040
I cannot trust my mom.

830
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,280
It doesn't work, does it?

831
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,360
Will you help me?

832
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,560
I will.

833
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:25,560
I will.

834
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:27,800
Then, get better soon,

835
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,360
so you can help me raise the baby.

836
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,040
Right?

837
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:01,560
My darling.

838
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,159
We can eat nothing

839
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,159
but the soup.

840
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,399
Our mom cooked it for you.

841
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,399
It's very nutritious!

842
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,399
Mengxin.

843
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,280
I don't eat it.

844
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,399
My darling.

845
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,000
The C-section

846
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,959
brought you a wound,

847
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,520
and the soup is good

848
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,879
for your recovery.

849
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,840
Who caused it?

850
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,760
I'm asking you a question!

851
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,959
No way.

852
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,479
I'll drink the soup, and eat food.

853
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,719
I'll recover so as to

854
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,959
get even with Xu Meng'an!

855
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:35,399
Come on, my darling.

856
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:40,000
That's right.

857
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,840
Only when you eat more

858
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,520
can you be recovered

859
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,560
to get even with your sister!

860
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,360
How could she do that?

861
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:46,959
Eat more food,

862
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,120
and drink more soup.

863
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,479
You want me to eat

864
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,080
and drink

865
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,600
so as to feed your baby like a cow,

866
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,080
don't you?

867
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,879
I don't have the gut!

868
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,520
All I want is to help you recover!

869
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,959
We don't need to feed her.

870
00:30:58,959 --> 00:30:59,879
We have formula,

871
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:00,719
which is nutritious

872
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,719
and enough for our baby.

873
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,320
Darling,

874
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,520
what else do you want to eat?

875
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,639
I'll buy it for you.

876
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,800
I want sweets.

877
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,080
Steamed buns with wine.

878
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,879
Rice with sweat bean sand...

879
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,000
Mengxin.

880
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,919
Mom.

881
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:17,399
Mengxin.

882
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,919
Here comes a prolactinist.

883
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:20,800
Prolactinist?

884
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,399
I won't do breastfeeding.

885
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,199
My wound hasn't been healed!

886
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,639
No way to force me to be a cow!

887
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,679
Jia Haowen.

888
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:28,600
We should do this!

889
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,520
Otherwise, you'll have inflammation.

890
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:32,760
Get out!

891
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:34,040
Get out!

892
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:35,280
Get out!

893
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,080
Please get out.

894
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,360
Take your time.

895
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,520
Get out of here.

896
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,639
So sorry for coming here.

897
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,199
Okay.

898
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,280
Goodbye.

899
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,080
Take care.

900
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,040
Bye-bye.

901
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,199
I reckon that Mengxin

902
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,080
is taking it out on me

903
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,520
in her postpartum confinement.

904
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,479
Mom, be quiet.

905
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,320
She was not like that before.

906
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,840
Don't lie to me!

907
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,439
I've noticed the injury

908
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:09,280
made by her.

909
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,679
When did she hit me?

910
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,080
It's just an accident.

911
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,000
I've also noticed

912
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,560
how obedient you are

913
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,919
in front of her.

914
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,520
You call it obedient?

915
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:20,600
It's my way to run my family.

916
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,959
Don't meddle with it!

917
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,040
She's in great pain,

918
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
so we have to be obedient.

919
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:26,919
For what?

920
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,199
Do you owe her?

921
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,439
For what?

922
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:31,840
Don't you know

923
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,360
how her father

924
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,399
went to hospital?

925
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,120
Fine.

926
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:38,879
I see.

927
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,120
I'll also be obedient to her.

928
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,840
Just a few months.

929
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,159
I'll pretend to be obedient.

930
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,320
I'll do it!

931
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,399
Mom, sorry for

932
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,840
putting up with her.

933
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
Don't forget your promise.

934
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,919
I know.

935
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,879
Mom,

936
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,560
I'll but her some food.

937
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,120
Go ahead.

938
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,560
Do you need any?

939
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,120
No need.

940
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,120
Just tell me.

941
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,679
No need.

942
00:32:58,959 --> 00:32:59,879
Go ahead!

943
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:00,439
I'll go, mom.

944
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:00,959
Okay.

945
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,879
Massage is the doctor's prescription.

946
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,760
You'll get better with it.

947
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,080
Xu,

948
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,800
get better soon.

949
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:28,840
Uncle!

950
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:30,159
Auntie.

951
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,479
Jing is here.

952
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,159
Sorry for being late.

953
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,560
Please forgive me

954
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,919
for coming here late.

955
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,080
Jing,

956
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,520
why are you here?

957
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,320
Why did you come here

958
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,439
from far away?

959
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,800
Your husband is ill,

960
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,879
why can't I come here?

961
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:44,239
Aren't we families?

962
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:44,639
Yes.

963
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,120
Am I right?

964
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,560
Please have a seat.

965
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,600
Sit down.

966
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,959
What happened to him?

967
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,239
He had a stroke.

968
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,479
A stroke?

969
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,879
Right, the mouth is crooked.

970
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,719
The doctor said he's much better.

971
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Well, you see,

972
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
your husband's ill,

973
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,800
but I can give you nothing

974
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,199
except for

975
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,560
the red envelope.

976
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,679
No way!

977
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,320
I cannot take your money.

978
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,879
No way!

979
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:12,479
I really can't!

980
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,120
Look at you!

981
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,879
Take it,

982
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,560
or I'll be angry with you!

983
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:17,719
Not too much, is it?

984
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,440
Well,

985
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,560
it's so kind of you. Thanks.

986
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,719
Come here.

987
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,199
Let me have a look.

988
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,759
Hello!

989
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,319
Jesus,

990
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,639
does he lose his consciousness?

991
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,480
It's alright!

992
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,920
I am Li Jing.

993
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,000
Remember?

994
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,400
The paternal aunt!

995
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,480
Yunjie's aunt!

996
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:44,880
Well.

997
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,520
Have a seat.

998
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,159
Okay.

999
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,759
Let me see...

1000
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,199
Oh, the hand!

1001
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:49,639
Oh, my God!

1002
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
This is so...

1003
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,880
Don't worry.

1004
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,639
I've learnt to cure the disease.

1005
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:58,560
My husband, Ouyang,

1006
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,920
prescribed some TCM for him.

1007
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,799
I'll tell you how to take it.

1008
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,359
I'll also tell Lanxiang.

1009
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,319
Mr. Xu,

1010
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:11,199
the post-hospital recovery

1011
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,199
can be done

1012
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,359
in our clinic,

1013
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,000
okay?

1014
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,040
Look at his expression.

1015
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,799
Is it yes or no?

1016
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:25,359
A stroke like this

1017
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,000
needs special treatment.

1018
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,600
Okay.

1019
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,279
No problem.

1020
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,920
He dislikes others touching him.

1021
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,199
Okay, I see.

1022
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,480
I get it.

1023
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,560
I came here, for one reason

1024
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,359
is to pay a visit to him.

1025
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:45,960
Right.

1026
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,719
For another, I'll visit Mengxin.

1027
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Most importantly,

1028
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
Meng'an is pregnant,

1029
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,120
so,

1030
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,279
I won't leave until Meng'an gave birth

1031
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:00,839
and finish her postpartum confinement.

1032
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,520
Three months!

1033
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,440
A long period!

1034
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,520
Not a single day should be missed!

1035
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,759
Three months?

1036
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,560
Well,

1037
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,359
when has Meng'an

1038
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,920
asked for help?

1039
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,799
There's no need.

1040
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:13,719
We have Lanxiang

1041
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,639
here.

1042
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Don't worry.

1043
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,040
Everything is arranged.

1044
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:19,679
Mr. Xu,

1045
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,639
I won't touch you.

1046
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,040
Do you like the meal

1047
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,719
made by Lanxiang?

1048
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:27,639
See?

1049
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,600
After you're discharged from hospital,

1050
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,400
I'll let Lanxiang

1051
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,159
attend to your diet and daily life.

1052
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,319
No.

1053
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,440
No need.

1054
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,560
Don't worry.

1055
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,600
As long as I'm here,

1056
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,440
everything can be arranged.

1057
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,440
I should visit Mengxin now.

1058
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,520
How blessed she is

1059
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,960
to have a boy and a girl!

1060
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,040
I'd like to take a piece of luck.

1061
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,960
Well,

1062
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,359
Mengxin has just done a C-section.

1063
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,120
It is not convenient for you

1064
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,199
to visit her.

1065
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,759
It's okay. Just some presents.

1066
00:36:59,359 --> 00:36:59,719
Alright.

1067
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,440
You should

1068
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,080
have a good rest.

1069
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,319
Wish you...

1070
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:04,839
No...

1071
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:05,759
recover soon.

1072
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:07,520
I'll leave now.

1073
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,839
Okay.

1074
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,440
Well.

1075
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,719
See you later.

1076
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,080
Okay.

1077
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,359
Recover soon.

1078
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,159
I have a word with Lanxiang.

1079
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,239
Okay.

1080
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,120
Goodbye.

1081
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,080
Goodbye.

1082
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,040
Let's go.

1083
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,719
I'll be back soon.

1084
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,839
Don't worry. She's gone.

1085
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,279
She'll visit Mengxin.

1086
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:40,159
I'm afraid she'll bring her trouble.

1087
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,759
Don't worry.

1088
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:56,600
It's me!

1089
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
His physical condition now

1090
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,600
needs your patience and care.

1091
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,199
Thank you.

1092
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,400
Don't be afraid.

1093
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,080
I'm not.

1094
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,120
See?

1095
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,120
Meng'an didn't detest

1096
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,239
my family condition.

1097
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,199
She asked me to stay,

1098
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:11,759
and gave me a lot of things

1099
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,319
including red envelopes,

1100
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:14,799
so I'm so grateful

1101
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:16,000
for your whole family!

1102
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,400
I'll do my best!

1103
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,120
Don't worry.

1104
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,080
Meng'an is a good person.

1105
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,600
Yes.

1106
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,679
She has good virtues.

1107
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:24,080
However,

1108
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
you also did a good merit!

1109
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:27,120
No, I...

1110
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:27,880
Well...

1111
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,239
You helped Meng'an keep her baby.

1112
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,279
No, I...

1113
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,600
And you informed me secretly.

1114
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,480
No,

1115
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,639
my sister.

1116
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,440
Never tell anybody

1117
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,319
about the dial!

1118
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:39,480
What am I? A fool?

1119
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,080
However,

1120
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,639
I thought

1121
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,400
I didn't tell you anything,

1122
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,319
but

1123
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,400
a super faint hint

1124
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,159
was instantly noticed by you.

1125
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:50,960
Who am I?

1126
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,199
I am Li Jing.

1127
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,759
When I just came here,

1128
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:58,799
Meng'an was having a rest.

1129
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,319
It is still a question mark

1130
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:01,560
if the baby can be kept.

1131
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:05,239
They didn’t allow me to tell others,

1132
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,600
not a single one,

1133
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,839
and I didn’t want to gossip.

1134
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,799
But afterwards,

1135
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
when I heard that they were

1136
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,759
deciding not to keep the baby,

1137
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,440
it suddenly occurred to me

1138
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
that the reason Ouyang

1139
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,960
married into

1140
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,159
the Li Family

1141
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,279
was to raise offspring

1142
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:23,679
to our family!

1143
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:24,239
If...

1144
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,000
If the baby of Meng'an

1145
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,199
is a boy,

1146
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,239
and they're aborting it,

1147
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,560
I'll be damned

1148
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,920
if I don't tell you

1149
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,239
what happened!

1150
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,920
That's what I mean.

1151
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,000
You did a good merit,

1152
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:39,880
right?

1153
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,199
Good virtues are not her privilege,

1154
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,319
but I, Li Jing,

1155
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
also have them.

1156
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,159
Come on.

1157
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:47,960
This

1158
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:49,319
is the red envelope for you.

1159
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,440
No way!

1160
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,880
Stop!

1161
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,440
It's my reward for you!

1162
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,359
Take it,

1163
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,440
or I'll be angry with you.

1164
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,080
Just take it.

1165
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,920
Thanks a lot.

1166
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:04,440
Well,

1167
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,920
do you have the address

1168
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,839
where Mengxin delivered her baby?

1169
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,719
Send it to me.

1170
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,239
Are you going there?

1171
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,359
Of course.

1172
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,679
It's a joyful event to have a baby.

1173
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,159
We should show our virtues,

1174
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,040
don't we?

1175
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:23,960
Mom.

1176
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Wait for a moment,

1177
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,000
and don't come in.

1178
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,639
Take them out, mom.

1179
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,719
Be careful.

1180
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,799
Close the door.

1181
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,440
Mengxin,

1182
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,679
here are your favorite sweets!

1183
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:03,159
So yummy!

1184
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
I don't want it.

1185
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,159
What a waste!

1186
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:16,839
Hello,

1187
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,239
is this the room of Xu Mengxin?

1188
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,880
Yes.

1189
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,199
Who are you?

1190
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
You must be her matron!

1191
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,400
These are fruits for Mengxin.

1192
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:28,000
Wash them later

1193
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,359
for Mengxin.

1194
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:30,719
Wait.

1195
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,400
Who on earth are you?

1196
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,000
You won't understand.

1197
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,199
How couldn't I?

1198
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,480
Are you speaking a foreign language?

1199
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,159
I do apologize.

1200
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,159
Well,

1201
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,719
you must

1202
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,159
be the baby's grandma, aren't you?

1203
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,719
Sorry for my stupidity!

1204
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:51,960
I do apologize.

1205
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,639
I hope you can forgive me.

1206
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,319
Darling,

1207
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,839
it's still warm. Have a taste.

1208
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,480
I'll take a snap.

1209
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,319
Okay.

1210
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,839
If you want to sleep,

1211
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,799
I'll be there for you.

1212
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,799
Eat it after you're awake.

1213
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,639
So tell me.

1214
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Who on earth are you?

1215
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,799
I am Li Jing,

1216
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,359
the sister of Li Lin,

1217
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,159
who is the husband of Meng'an,

1218
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,120
the sister of Mengxin.

1219
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,560
Fine, I get it.

1220
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,759
Sister-in-law of the Xu Family.

1221
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:21,719
There you go,

1222
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,000
my dear sister!

1223
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,719
You're so clever!

1224
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,159
Wait!

1225
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:27,159
How could you call me sister?

1226
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:28,679
I'm not your dear sister!

1227
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,359
I'm Xiongxiong's grandmother,

1228
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,560
while you are his

1229
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,759
distant aunt!

1230
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,199
You should call me...

1231
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,199
Auntie!

1232
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,480
Right.

1233
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,400
You're my auntie.

1234
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,159
The yummy sweets

1235
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,000
are still warm.

1236
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:04,159
Let me explain it to you.

1237
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,239
Meng'an

1238
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,520
is pregnant,

1239
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,120
so I'll take care of her.

1240
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,199
Meng'an told me about Mengxin,

1241
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,159
so I rushed over here

1242
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,359
to take a piece of luck.

1243
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,440
A piece of luck.

1244
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:14,960
You see,

1245
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,000
it's a present

1246
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,159
for our dear baby.

1247
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,839
How blessed you are!

1248
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,560
A boy and a girl

1249
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,159
make up the word "blessing".

1250
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,639
Fine. Follow me.

1251
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,080
I'll put it aside.

1252
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,040
Auntie,

1253
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,239
I'll take it.

1254
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:37,920
Go away!

1255
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,560
Okay.

1256
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,600
Follow me.
