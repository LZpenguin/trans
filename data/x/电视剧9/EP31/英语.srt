Check this out.

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,240
This is a

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
small, fully automated

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
clothing production workshop.

7
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,079
As we're considering launching

8
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,600
a pilot project,

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,680
I believe it's essential for our company

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,880
to have a full-fledged factory,

11
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,960
not just a pilot.

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,359
Okay,

13
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,839
let's take a look.

14
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,880
Excuse me.

15
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,160
Okay, I'm going to continue.

16
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,199
This equipment can

17
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,360
make a three-dimensional cut cashmere coat

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,879
all in one go.

19
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,800
If we get an order

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
for over 100 pieces,

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
it's definitely enough.

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,999
Plus, it will significantly shorten

23
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,920
our fashion brand's

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,400
production cycle,

25
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,999
and we'll be more flexible and responsive

26
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,999
to the market in terms of design.

27
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,439
Let me show you again.

28
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,240
Jia Haowen,

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,759
are you messing around

30
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,999
with the nanny?

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
Are you socializing or babysitting?

32
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,159
Mrs Jia.

33
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,439
At the postpartum care center,

34
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:05,999
I sensed something fishy

35
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:06,879
between you and Haowen.

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,879
You hand-held Haowen

37
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,039
how to bathe

38
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,680
and apply the cream

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,879
to my baby.

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,439
When Xiongxiong was born,

41
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,240
Haowen knew exactly what to do.

42
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,839
But in front of you,

43
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:14,640
he seems clueless, and you have to

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,960
guide him through everything.

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
You were supposed to care for me

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
during my maternity period, but did you?

47
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,960
All you do is

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,599
please my husband

49
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,559
and my mother-in-law.

50
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,120
Are you here to work,

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
or are you here to be the mistress?

52
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,319
Xin, please don't be upset.

53
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,920
I sent this scarf

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,439
to Shanshan as a gift.

55
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,719
You are solely focused on

56
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,839
your granddaughter.

57
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,080
"Did my granddaughter eat well today?"

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,400
"How did my granddaughter sleep today?"

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
"Did my granddaughter drink well today?"

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,279
All you do is to

61
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:35,920
coddle your granddaughter.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,680
What about me?

63
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,879
Can you see me?

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,879
So here comes this woman

65
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,200
who's good at cooking,

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,439
babysitting,

67
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,599
and always by your side,

68
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,360
picking on me.

69
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,800
Now, she's even wearing

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,439
the same scarf as I do.

71
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,360
What's next?

72
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,520
Will she start sleeping in my bedroom

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,439
and taking care of my daughter?

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,879
Please don't get upset, Mrs Jia.

75
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,175
It's only been a little over a month

76
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:52,240
since your C-section surgery.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Getting angry is harmful to your health.

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,279
You still get it, right?

79
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,619
You still know that

80
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,719
I'm the woman in charge at home?

81
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,960
Then why are you

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,480
always around her?

83
00:03:58,999 --> 00:03:59,759
Don't think I don't know

84
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,719
what you're up to.

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,943
If you want to be the mistress,

86
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:02,599
just be straightforward about it.

87
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,960
Mrs Jia,

88
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,159
I am a

89
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,920
professionally trained

90
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,200
maternity matron.

91
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,800
I rely on my skills,

92
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,800
not tricks, to do my job well.

93
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,680
If that's your opinion of me,

94
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,159
then I see no reason

95
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,920
to stay here any longer.

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,319
No reason to stay here any longer?

97
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,159
I think you're doing quite well here.

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,680
You seemed very relaxed

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,920
while chatting and laughing just now.

100
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,519
Ma'am,

101
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,199
thank you.

102
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,280
Shanshan,

103
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:32,879
don't go.

104
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,680
Why are you leaving?

105
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,720
You seemed so sure of yourself just now.

106
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,319
Or I can leave to let you stay.

107
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,240
Mom,

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,559
Ying,

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
the baby's here.

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,559
Why don't you stop chatting

111
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,920
and take care of the baby?

112
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
Seriously, take a good look at yourself.

113
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,040
It's obvious that you're not

114
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,319
committed to the company.

115
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,120
The shareholders' meeting today

116
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,559
was supposed to

117
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,920
demonstrate how dedicated you are.

118
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
Rumors are going around.

119
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,959
I wanted to boost

120
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,639
their confidence in your investments.

121
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,959
What made them

122
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,759
invest in you?

123
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,040
What was the reason?

124
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,959
It wasn't just your

125
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,999
brand name.

126
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,920
It was your integrity.

127
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,360
They wanted to know

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,920
if they could trust you.

129
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,519
But look at what you've done.

130
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,720
You've disgraced yourself.

131
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,920
You've become the butt of jokes.

132
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,920
I've also become a joke.

133
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,800
I can't cover you any longer.

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,879
Take care of yourself.

135
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,759
How can my mom ask me

136
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,999
to forgive Zhu Kexin?

137
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,199
Yes, Zhu Kexin cheated on the test

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,319
and framed you.

139
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,399
Why should you forgive her?

140
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,319
Yeah.

141
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,559
I used the trick you taught me.

142
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,439
Which one?

143
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,759
I taught you a lot of tricks.

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
My mom said that

145
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,160
Zhu Kexin is

146
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,759
her mom's only hope.

147
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,879
So, I said,

148
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,280
"Yes, she's her only hope,

149
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,199
but I'm different.

150
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,920
You've got a second child now.

151
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,600
You've got other hopes."

152
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,600
I don't expect you to

153
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,280
use that trick in that manner.

154
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,879
So,

155
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,920
what's your next move?

156
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,319
What options do I have?

157
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,319
Actually,

158
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,800
I not unreasonable.

159
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,680
I don't want Zhu Kexin to get in

160
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
serious trouble and be banned from taking

161
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,079
the High School Entrance Examination.

162
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,639
I just want to stand up to my mom;

163
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,439
she should be on my side

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,160
instead of speaking for Zhu Kexin.

165
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,759
He Lu,

166
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,559
He Lu,

167
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
are you talking about that incident?

168
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,920
Yes, what's wrong?

169
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,559
You weren't present then,

170
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,999
but I was there the whole time.

171
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,959
Yunjie,

172
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,240
your parents, especially your mom,

173
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,040
really stood by you.

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,840
If she hadn't insisted, how could the

175
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,079
school have redone the investigation

176
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,280
and proven that Zhu Kexin cheated?

177
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,480
What?

178
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,319
Tell me more.

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,360
At first,

180
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:08,600
Ms Xue

181
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,160
went to Yunjie's parents

182
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,999
and claimed they found a cheat sheet

183
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
in Yunjie's drawer.

184
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,160
The CCTV footage confirmed that

185
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,280
the inspector found it

186
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,959
from Yunjie's drawer,

187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,120
so, it was basically a closed case.

188
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,399
I didn't do that.

189
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:20,999
I know.

190
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,920
Your mom

191
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
chose to believe in you and insisted that

192
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,120
the cheat sheet didn't belong to you.

193
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,399
She pushed for a re-investigation

194
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,840
and demanded that Ms Xue

195
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,360
confront Zhu Kexin's mom

196
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,480
before the truth finally came out,

197
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,559
didn't she?

198
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,240
The most important thing

199
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
here is that

200
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,280
your parents

201
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,680
believe in you unconditionally

202
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,519
and support you.

203
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,560
If it were my dad,

204
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,840
he would've just given me a good beating

205
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,960
without hearing me out,

206
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,960
and maybe even

207
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,639
kicked me into the river.

208
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Yeah,

209
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,480
my parents

210
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,039
would suspect me first.

211
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,200
Even if they reluctantly trusted that

212
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,919
I didn't do it,

213
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,560
they'd be like,

214
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
"Why are they only

215
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,639
suspecting you?

216
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,639
Maybe you should

217
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,560
take a good look at yourself."

218
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,120
That's true.

219
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
As the saying goes,

220
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,080
flies don't bite a seamless egg.

221
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,639
Yeah, they love this saying.

222
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,600
My mom also used to say this

223
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,720
when she talked about Liu Siming.

224
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,039
What did she say about me?

225
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,159
Nothing.

226
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,120
Nothing.

227
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,200
Let's go.

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay.

229
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:19,999
Come on.

230
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,999
I'm telling you that flies are not good.

231
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,560
Flies are cool.

232
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
What's wrong with flies?

233
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,200
They are good at flying.

234
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:27,960
They can fly six to

235
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
eight kilometers an hour.

236
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,759
I'd love to be a fly

237
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,679
and zoom around fast.

238
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,360
Excuse me,

239
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,840
ma'am.

240
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,639
I'm sorry to bother you.

241
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,039
Do you know where Liu Siming's class is?

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm his dad.

243
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:47,720
Please wait for a moment.

244
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,320
Mr Liu,

245
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,080
Mr Liu!

246
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,639
No, forget it.

247
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,519
Lin,

248
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,919
it's been a long time.

249
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,320
Yeah.

250
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,679
It's been a long time since we met.

251
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,279
That's true.

252
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,360
I haven't met you since your family moved.

253
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,840
Same here.

254
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
But I saw your wife once.

255
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,600
It's on the event

256
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,080
when my son

257
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,960
gave flowers to your daughter.

258
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,200
Well,

259
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,919
we still have some time

260
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,560
before the kids' class ends.

261
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,799
It's been ages since we've met each other.

262
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,519
Let's find a place

263
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,039
to have some tea and catch up.

264
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,960
Great!

265
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,600
Xin,

266
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,799
why'd you come back all of a sudden?

267
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,480
What's with the sudden return?

268
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,279
Mom, do you not want me to come back home?

269
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,320
No, you're entirely welcome!

270
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,799
Why all the packages?

271
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,679
Did you and Haowen have another fight?

272
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Why do you always assume that?

273
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,200
Every time I return,

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,080
you think it's due to a fight with him.

275
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,120
That's pretty much the case every time.

276
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,999
Didn't I tell you that

277
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,080
I didn't fight with him?

278
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,799
I told you about that.

279
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,840
With the maternity matron quitting

280
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,879
and no one taking care of the baby,

281
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,159
where else can I go

282
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,120
other than here?

283
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,120
Alright, having you back is good.

284
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,519
You'll be more comfortable at home.

285
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,799
Lanxiang and I will take care of the baby

286
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
so, you can stay here comfortably.

287
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,320
I'm hungry.

288
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,720
What do you want to eat?

289
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,639
Small wontons.

290
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,560
Sure, I'll ask Lanxiang to make them.

291
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,120
Bro,

292
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,120
you're still your usual self,

293
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,200
guzzling beers like they're water.

294
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,720
Yeah, absolutely.

295
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,560
I get concerned sometimes that Siming,

296
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
the same way you are.

297
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,799
Definitely.

298
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,080
drinking habits.

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
The influence of genetics and

300
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,879
the impact of family traits is strong.

301
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,919
Hey, look at this.

302
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,519
Do you see it?

303
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,200
Where do you think this came from?

304
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,039
I see it, I see it.

305
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,799
Siming's impressive speed

306
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,639
on the racetrack

307
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,799
is inherited from me.

308
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,240
Although I was

309
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,879
slower than he is now,

310
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,560
my athletic genes played a role in him.

311
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,320
Like father, like son.

312
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,799
It's a widely accepted theory.

313
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,600
Although Siming

314
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,399
got the athletic genes from me,

315
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,639
ever since childhood, he's been saying,

316
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,360
"See Uncle Li

317
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,240
and his wife, both graduates of

318
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
top universities. You should

319
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,320
aim for higher education like them."

320
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,600
I don't have the academic genes. If I did,

321
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,879
I might have gone to a top university.

322
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,639
Listen,

323
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,679
I think

324
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,919
Siming is a really nice

325
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,919
and motivated child.

326
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:28,639
Totally.

327
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,159
He's got his whole future in front of him.

328
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,639
Yeah, I agree.

329
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,519
I've seen

330
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,519
Siming grow up.

331
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:32,759
Yeah.

332
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,279
You know it, do you?

333
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,120
Siming gets along well

334
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,039
with my daughter, Yunjie.

335
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,399
They're very close.

336
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,120
Siming is a kid who values friendship

337
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,279
and is very loyal.


338
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,200
They're both good kids.

339
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,399
But, you know, they're both

340
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,320
still pretty young.

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,159
Not at all. Siming is like 5'11" already.

342
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,120
And Yunjie has grown so much.

343
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
Is she 14 now?

344
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,999
She and Siming are both 15 years old.

345
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
Yeah.

346
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,560
In the past, people this age could have

347
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,759
already been married and had kids.

348
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,879
It's in modern times.

349
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,039
The kids are keeping up with the times.

350
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,720
Listen...

351
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Why are you holding them up for?

352
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,240
If they're dating,

353
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,480
it's their business.

354
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,080
Why should we interfere with

355
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,120
what the kids want?

356
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,360
Let it be.

357
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,159
For some critical matters,

358
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,639
we can't just let it be.

359
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,960
They're in the last year of middle school,

360
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,799
preparing for

361
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,759
the High School Entrance Examination,

362
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,799
which is a big deal

363
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,919
for them.

364
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
They've got a long way to go,

365
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,639
but every step

366
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,960
has to be solid.

367
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,279
I hope

368
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,279
they both

369
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,799
put all their energy and time

370
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,159
into their studies

371
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,320
to make progress together.

372
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,999
Don't you think it's a good idea?

373
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:21,279
No worries.

374
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,560
Am I right?

375
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,639
Siming is a good kid,

376
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,840
so, I'm not worried about him.

377
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,759
Yunjie, your daughter,

378
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,720
is also very good, so we shouldn't

379
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
worry too much about her either.

380
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,960
I mean,

381
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,360
your family has moved

382
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,720
so far away.

383
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,279
Why not find a school nearby

384
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,240
for Siming?

385
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,120
I want him to go to

386
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,639
a top middle school, too.

387
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,639
Siming's talent in racing

388
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,440
will get him into

389
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,240
any top high school.

390
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,399
However, he doesn't want to go.

391
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,879
He only wants to go to the same school

392
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,999
as your daughter. What can I do?

393
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:46,560
That's...

394
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Let's not meddle in their business.

395
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,120
For this matter,

396
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,999
as parents,

397
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,399
I think we must

398
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,440
step in here.

399
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,999
They are in a stage of immaturity

400
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,560
where they are not ready to

401
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:55,999
make certain decisions, are they?

402
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:56,919
For some matters,

403
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,320
we should be the ones

404
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,560
making decisions for them.

405
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,080
There are some boundaries

406
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,279
they cannot cross.

407
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm not entirely convinced.

408
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:02,999
No,

409
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,039
you don't understand.

410
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,639
I mean,

411
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,759
you're raising a boy.

412
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,200
So, you don't get my point.

413
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:07,759
Okay.

414
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,320
I'm raising a girl.

415
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,960
Yeah, a daughter.

416
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,799
Yunjie holds great significance for me.

417
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,159
Siming is a boy. He is easy to raise

418
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
and can thrive with less care.

419
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,879
But Yunjie is a girl,

420
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,279
and I cherish her deeply.

421
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,879
She's like the rose

422
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,120
I planted in my past life.

423
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,159
She requires dedicated care

424
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,399
and a fertile environment to thrive.

425
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,600
I can't let a delicate flower

426
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,560
be stuck in

427
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,159
in...

428
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,600
Wait, are you implying that

429
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,320
Yunjie is a flower

430
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,560
while Siming

431
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,240
is cow dung?

432
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,999
I'm not saying that.

433
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:33,600
How can I get married to my wife

434
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
if a flower can't bloom on cow dung?

435
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:34,960
No,

436
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,399
that's a different case.

437
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:36,759
You get me wrong.

438
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,279
I got it.

439
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,799
Your main point is not about cow dung.

440
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,360
So, your concern is that

441
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,279
they might develop a relationship, right?

442
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,440
Yes.

443
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
If they both have a crush on each other,

444
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,360
I won't get involved.

445
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,360
But if Siming dares to take the crush to

446
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,960
the next level, I will beat him.

447
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,720
Is that okay?

448
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,080
That's a deal.

449
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,519
Deal.

450
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,320
You must keep an eye on Siming.

451
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,919
Cheer.

452
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,840
Actually, I don't mind

453
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,120
being your in-law.

454
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
But I do mind.

455
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,759
Mrs Xu,

456
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,679
Mr Xu,

457
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,240
look at this.

458
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,039
I bought two fresh fish at the pier.

459
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,159
One for Meng'an to take home

460
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,279
and another for us to...

461
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:26,759
oops, the bag is leaking water.

462
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,720
Little Watermelon's here.

463
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,320
Oh my God,

464
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,399
you're here.

465
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,200
Hold on, hold on.

466
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,999
When did you...

467
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:36,360
Wait a moment.

468
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,639
Don't touch her now.

469
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,799
I forgot it.

470
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,840
First, disinfect my hands.

471
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,080
Let me do it.

472
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Yeah.

473
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,279
Babies

474
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,240
have weak immune systems, do they?

475
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,120
Let's make sure to

476
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,399
disinfect my hands.

477
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,560
I've finished cooking the wontons.

478
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,279
Great.

479
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:50,879
Disinfect.

480
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,360
Jing.

481
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,200
Where are you off to?

482
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,039
I'm taking Uncle to his rehab training.

483
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,960
Let's get going.

484
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,279
Let's go, Uncle.

485
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,279
Come on.

486
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:00,999
You've got this!

487
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,840
Come on, Little Watermelon.

488
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,519
Give it your all to kick your legs.

489
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:04,879
That's it.

490
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,320
Give it your best shot.

491
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,600
Mr Xu,

492
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,919
you need to do your rehab training.

493
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,879
Come on.

494
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,560
Let's go.

495
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,639
I'm not up for the rehab training today.

496
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:16,200
That's not cool.

497
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,039
Mr Xu,

498
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,960
You must take your

499
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,440
rehab training seriously

500
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,759
and care for your body.

501
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,560
I mean,

502
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,639
you already have Little Watermelon.

503
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,120
When Meng'an has

504
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,039
Little Grape,

505
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,360
Little Grape and Little Watermelon

506
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,679
will run around the yard.

507
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,799
Yeah.

508
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,519
Take it easy.

509
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,120
Relax.

510
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,560
Uncle,

511
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:34,480
uncle,

512
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,879
take it easy.

513
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,639
How's it going?

514
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:36,919
Take it easy.

515
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,120
Our Little Watermelon.

516
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,999
Lanxiang,

517
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,519
don't help him. Let him walk on his own.

518
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,320
I know.

519
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:43,960
Little Watermelon,

520
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,759
be a good baby.

521
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,879
Look at her.

522
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,919
Little Watermelon

523
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,039
is smiling at me.

524
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,600
You know, babies grow so fast

525
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,560
and change every day.

526
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,879
That's so true.

527
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,159
Just wait until the second half of

528
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,519
the year when An has her second child.

529
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,600
You'll be super busy then.

530
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,679
I've been eagerly waiting for that day.

531
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,840
I've been so anxious.

532
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,240
Jing, you've been running around town

533
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,799
during this period.

534
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,840
Xin,

535
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,639
what happened?

536
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,919
It's broken.

537
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,600
Please don't touch it.

538
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,320
I didn't.

539
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,159
I want to clean up.

540
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:50,479
No worries.

541
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,280
Leave it there.

542
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,520
Let me clean it.

543
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,399
Xin,

544
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:02,959
come on.

545
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,199
Yeah,

546
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,639
sit over here.

547
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:07,959
Be careful

548
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,280
not to injure your hands.

549
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,840
I will take care of the mess.

550
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,639
Mu.

551
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:32,080
Ms Xu.

552
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:32,639
Sit down.

553
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Head to the tech department to

554
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:35,840
get the data for

555
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,560
the new subscribers this week.

556
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,360
Also,

557
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,560
look into their behavior patterns

558
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,959
Okay.

559
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,879
Ms Xu.

560
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,399
Ms Xu,

561
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,239
are you looking for Miss Huang?

562
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:12,840
She's not here.

563
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,080
Well, I'll leave you to it then.

564
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,080
How many times do I have to

565
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,280
remind you to unlock the door?

566
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,439
You played really well, Mr Zhou.

567
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:50,719
Why do you stop playing?

568
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,719
You need to practice more.

569
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,000
You're well-equipped.

570
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,439
I know, I'm an equipment guy.

571
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,399
I lost interest

572
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:56,959
in practicing

573
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,040
once I collected all the equipment.

574
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,840
Mr Zhou, I've heard

575
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,239
you also excel in

576
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,199
horse riding, tennis, and soccer.

577
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:07,959
I'm only dabbling in these sports

578
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,959
as I have plenty of free time.

579
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
With Wendy

580
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,280
helping us make money,

581
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,320
I've got more time to relax and have fun.

582
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,679
Well,

583
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,800
how often do you get to

584
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,399
see your kids after the divorce?

585
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,879
I usually see them

586
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,600
during visiting hours.

587
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,399
Every weekend,

588
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,040
Mr Yu spends a whole day with the kids.

589
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
All day?

590
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,080
What if you have work to do?

591
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,239
Sometimes, I send the kids to

592
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,000
their grandparents

593
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,199
when I'm working.

594
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,080
They miss their grandchildren, too.

595
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:43,600
But you're their father.

596
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,159
You don't spend much time with them.

597
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,360
And the kids don't mind?

598
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,399
I really admire Wendy.

599
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:49,520
No matter how busy she is,

600
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,280
she can take care of the kids herself.

601
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,080
Really.

602
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,000
I believe that sometimes women

603
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,360
surpass men.

604
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,719
Wendy can juggle

605
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,320
multiple responsibilities at once.

606
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,040
She can handle work and family

607
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,000
duties simultaneously.

608
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,000
She can take care of household tasks

609
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,520
and tidy up herself

610
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,760
at the same time.

611
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:04,639
But some men can't even

612
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:05,800
get the job

613
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,000
done properly.

614
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,000
What do you think about that, Wendy?

615
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,959
Come on.

616
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,439
Well, men do

617
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,399
tend to be quite confident.

618
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,399
I think we women should pick up on

619
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,879
that confidence thing from them.

620
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,239
Am I right, Mr Yu?

621
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,919
Mr Yu is a very confident man.

622
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,120
Mr Yu,

623
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,560
I really believe it's crucial for you

624
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,959
to make more time

625
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,120
to support Wendy

626
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,000
in caring for the children.

627
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,280
This way, Wendy can

628
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,439
help me earn more money.

629
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,159
I don't want to bother Mr Yu.

630
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,600
I can do it myself.

631
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Let Mr Yu

632
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,520
efficiently manage Blue Ocean

633
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,000
so, that he can

634
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,399
help you earn more money.

635
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,199
That's true.

636
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,399
Does the investment project of Yaohui Co.

637
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,360
on Blue Ocean

638
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,760
get off the ground, Wendy? 

639
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,280
Yep, it's in the works

640
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,199
at the investment committee. I'm

641
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,239
planning to team up with

642
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,239
a few other organizations on this.

643
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,199
Mr Yu,

644
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,600
I like to joke around,

645
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,159
so, don't take my words too seriously.

646
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,879
You can consult Wendy on the project.

647
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,159
Wendy is in charge of it.

648
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:07,520
Excuse me for a phone call.

649
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:08,320
You guys have a good chat.

650
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,360
Sit here.

651
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,800
Okay.

652
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,959
Thank you.

653
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,399
You've done a big favor for me.

654
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,639
Although we're divorced,

655
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:21,719
you're still willing to help me.

656
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,760
Listen,

657
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:27,520
the financing option carries risks.

658
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,879
I'm aware of it.

659
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,159
Managing Blue Ocean by myself

660
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,879
for so long has been a real challenge.

661
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,840
Getting some financial support

662
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,280
would ease the burden.

663
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,040
So, I'm willing to take a risk

664
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,159
for the future of Blue Ocean.

665
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,760
See you next week, Mr Yu.

666
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:43,800
Thank you.

667
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,080
Well.

668
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,719
How's the conversation going?

669
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:45,719
Thanks, Mr Zhou.

670
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,159
I really appreciate your help.

671
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,080
You've helped me resolve

672
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,800
the financing issue

673
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,239
affecting Blue Ocean for years.

674
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,120
Thank you so much.

675
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,439
You should thank Wendy,

676
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,600
as she's the one managing the project.

677
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:55,280
Wendy,

678
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,719
come with me

679
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:57,800
on a business trip next week.

680
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,120
It's for a project with Huanan Group.

681
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,280
Next week?

682
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,399
How long will it take?

683
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,919
It will take a week.

684
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,679
What's wrong?

685
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,199
It's okay, Mr Zhou.

686
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:09,639
Next week is

687
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,719
our daughter's birthday.

688
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,199
It's okay.

689
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,840
I'll adjust the schedule

690
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,080
to hold the birthday party earlier.

691
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,159
I'll definitely follow up on the project.

692
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,360
Okay, it's a deal.

693
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:20,840
Okay.

694
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,120
Mr Yu,

695
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,000
would you like to continue playing?

696
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,399
Sure, I'll watch you play.

697
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:24,800
Go ahead.

698
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,560
Will Xin find a new maternity matron

699
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,600
now that the previous one has left?

700
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:43,760
I'm not sure.

701
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,080
Xin believes that the previous matron

702
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,080
couldn't take good care of the baby,

703
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,199
so now she wants to hire

704
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,040
someone new with a higher salary.

705
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,399
In my opinion, women have a natural

706
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,919
ability to take care of their babies.

707
00:24:58,679 --> 00:24:59,560
Mrs Xu,

708
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,080
you cannot think that way.

709
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,679
It's a matter of professionals

710
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,800
doing professional work.

711
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
I also realized this

712
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,040
after I learned the specialty of

713
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,360
maternal-child nursing.

714
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:12,479
Well, I'm well-trained.

715
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,120
I can take care of the baby.

716
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,600
Lanxiang also has relevant experience.

717
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,840
So, there are two professionals here.

718
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,879
Why bother to fire a new one?

719
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,639
As long as Xin stays here,

720
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:22,560
I can help her care for the baby.

721
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,080
It's a deal.

722
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,639
Lanxiang,

723
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:25,840
let's divide the work.

724
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,760
I'll take the day shift and come in

725
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
whenever I have nothing to do at home.

726
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,959
You can handle the night shift.

727
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,919
The two of us can be just

728
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:32,560
as good as one maternity matron.

729
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,600
You're right.

730
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,399
We can do it.

731
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:34,760
Okay.

732
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,639
I'm going to cook

733
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:36,560
some delicious food for Xin.

734
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,520
Little Watermelon,

735
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,360
be a good baby.

736
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,199
Come on.

737
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,479
You're bored, are you?

738
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,399
Let's go out and have some fun.

739
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,439
I know you are feeling bored.

740
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,239
Let's head outside

741
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,479
and have some fun.

742
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,760
Let's go hang out

743
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,000
and check out what's out there.

744
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,719
Come on.

745
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,639
Mom,

746
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:37,679
I missed you so much.

747
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,560
What took you so long to see me?

748
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,600
I thought you'd forgotten me.

749
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,479
Don't be silly.

750
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,320
How could I forget you?

751
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,560
Did you listen to Grandma and Grandpa?

752
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,520
What's up?

753
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,000
what are you thinking about?

754
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,520
I guess I know

755
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,879
the trick Huang Sisi used.

756
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,639
What trick?

757
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,600
Wait.

758
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,199
Ms Xu.

759
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,199
Ms Xu,

760
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:20,479
here's the backend data you want.

761
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,280
I've identified that

762
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,600
most of the users

763
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,560
are young male,

764
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,399
which boosts our website's

765
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,719
user activities.

766
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,879
What about behavior patterns?

767
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:29,959
These users

768
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,760
typically spend time on pages

769
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,840
featuring attractive women

770
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,919
and often leave...

771
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:36,959
Vulgar comments.

772
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,000
Huang Sisi

773
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,600
is using revealing pictures of women

774
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
found on the internet

775
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,879
and posting them on our website

776
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,199
as a marketing strategy

777
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,080
to increase website traffic.

778
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,479
What has she done to our website?

779
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:02,000
I feel like my work

780
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,040
has been undermined.

781
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,199
This can't go on,

782
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:04,959
Meng'an.

783
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,479
You must step in.

784
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,199
Revise the report,

785
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,439
and I'll reach out to Mr Zhang.

786
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,479
Okay.

787
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,199
It's so disgusting.

788
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,360
Xin,

789
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,199
Xin.

790
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,120
Jing.

791
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,040
I've prepared

792
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,120
a bowl of bird's nest soup for you.

793
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,439
Enjoy it while it's hot.

794
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,959
Thank you.

795
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,719
Don't mention it.

796
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,879
We're a family,

797
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,040
are we?

798
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,600
During your time at home,

799
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,360
focus on being happy.

800
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:52,959
Try not to overthink things.

801
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,520
Make sure to eat well and get enough rest.

802
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,280
When you have free time,

803
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
play with

804
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,719
Little Watermelon and

805
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,239
talk to your

806
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,560
mom and dad.

807
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,879
Remember, there's no need to be afraid.

808
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:04,520
No matter what happens,

809
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,120
we're here for you.

810
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,679
You look so beautiful

811
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,320
when you smile.

812
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:12,919
Alright.

813
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:14,080
Then enjoy it.

814
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,679
Thank you, Jing.

815
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,360
I'm going to check on Little Watermelon.

816
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:18,840
Okay.

817
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,919
Women are watching the fun.

818
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:35,520
Meng'an,

819
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:35,800
come on.

820
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,120
Mr Zhang.

821
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,679
Ms Xu.

822
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:37,959
How convenient

823
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,439
you're here, Miss Huang.

824
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:40,280
There's something

825
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,719
I need to discuss with you.

826
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,320
Here's the latest

827
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,360
user analysis report.

828
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,239
Please take a look at it.

829
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:50,199
No need.

830
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,439
Just tell me what you want to say.

831
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,439
I think there are some issues

832
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,639
with Miss Huang and her outsourcing team's

833
00:29:58,639 --> 00:29:59,760
approach to

834
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
driving traffic to the website.

835
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,040
Ms Xu, you can directly contact me

836
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:02,639
if you have any concerns about my team's

837
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:04,120
efforts to boost website traffic.

838
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,439
As soon as my approach works,

839
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,919
it's okay.

840
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,719
My marketing strategy

841
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,560
has attracted

842
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,600
many male users to our website,

843
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,280
making up for

844
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,040
Xinmiao's shortcomings.

845
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,639
Yeah.

846
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:14,600
You know, Meng'an,

847
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,840
the investors

848
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,600
are very happy with

849
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,840
how much traffic our website is getting.

850
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,320
So, you knew about this?

851
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,760
I'm curious,

852
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,639
is there anything else

853
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:29,760
you're keeping from me,

854
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,840
the content director?

855
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,040
Don't be upset.

856
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,959
I just want you to relax a bit,

857
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,040
especially since you're pregnant.

858
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,000
Mr Zhang,

859
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,040
you can't take that risk.

860
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,959
You're putting Xinmiao

861
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,439
in jeopardy.

862
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:42,360
Meng'an,

863
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,520
please try not to overreact.

864
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,399
If any inappropriate comments

865
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:46,760
come up,

866
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,399
we can delete them.

867
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,159
Well,

868
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,360
Miss Huang,

869
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,560
please inform the tech department

870
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,760
to pay attention to content risk control.

871
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,320
Sure.

872
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:55,840
There will be more refinements

873
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,239
to come,

874
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,840
so, don't worry.

875
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,840
No,

876
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,320
this is not acceptable.

877
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,080
You can't use such a

878
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,280
straightforward and inappropriate method

879
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,320
to increase traffic.

880
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,239
What type of image

881
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,199
do you want users to

882
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,320
associate with our platform?

883
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,560
We have built up years of

884
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,639
word-of-mouth

885
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:11,600
and a strong reputation.

886
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,280
Are you willing to throw that away?

887
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,520
This is how the industry,

888
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
including Blue Ocean, functions.

889
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,840
I don't care how others do it,

890
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,800
but we can't operate in the same way.

891
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
We are capable of setting our own path.

892
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,879
Why do we have to

893
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,120
follow others' old path,

894
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,239
especially in such a

895
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,080
crude manner?

896
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,719
Meng'an,

897
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,439
we both

898
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,959
have a background

899
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:28,919
in traditional media.

900
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,560
Among those who understand you,

901
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm one of them.

902
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,280
You've got your professional standards

903
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,919
and bottom line,

904
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:34,719
which is excellent.

905
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:35,959
But let's face it.

906
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,520
The market is so competitive today.

907
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,639
What do investors focus on?

908
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,199
It's user numbers,

909
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,040
daily activity,

910
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,439
and traffic data.

911
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Let's drop the noble souls talk, okay?

912
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,199
Survival is the priority,

913
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,600
so, why not adjust

914
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,239
our standards accordingly?

915
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,239
I really can't accept it, Mr Zhang.

916
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,239
Traditional mindset and conservative

917
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,760
operation can't gnaw the bones

918
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,679
of the sinking market.

919
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,560
Are you bent on stepping on the red line?

920
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,879
Do you know what the consequences

921
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,239
will be for Xinmiao?

922
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,280
Call it off.

923
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,679
We can't call it off, Mr Zhang.

924
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,879
Why are you so irritable?

925
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:08,280
It's not good for the baby.

926
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:09,439
Well,

927
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,280
she's pregnant.

928
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,199
The hormonal changes

929
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,280
are making her stubborn.

930
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,879
Don't take her words to heart.

931
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,840
Nah,

932
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,679
I'm the content director for Xinmiao.

933
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:20,040
I'm responsible for

934
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,479
the content that Xinmiao publishes.

935
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,159
Then, I need to be

936
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,600
responsible for the investors.

937
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,040
So what?

938
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,840
Xinmiao needs to raise funds.

939
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,679
It needs to expand.

940
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,760
The strategy is only for the short term.

941
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:31,479
It's okay as long as

942
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,399
we tighten supervision and monitoring.

943
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,600
Alright,

944
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,320
if that's what you want and I've already

945
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:48,280
informed you of all the potential risks,

946
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,239
then I'll leave you be.

947
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:53,639
I quit.

948
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:55,679
Sorry for the bother.

949
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,080
What did he say?

950
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:09,479
I can't persuade him.

951
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Huh?

952
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,239
What does that mean?

953
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,600
He wants performance

954
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,560
and data traffic.

955
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,080
What are his moral limits?

956
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,360
Ms Xu.

957
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:21,560
Mr Zhou.

958
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:22,800
You are both here.

959
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,600
What can I do for you?

960
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,239
It's nothing big.

961
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,879
I was just checking

962
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,760
when you're free in the next few days.

963
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,840
Can you come with me to Mr Lin's company?

964
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,280
Wait,

965
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
isn't our project

966
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,879
with his company done?

967
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:34,399
Yeah, it is.

968
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,879
The project is finished,

969
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:37,679
but he still hasn't paid us.

970
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,199
I've reminded him twice, but he's

971
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,959
dragging his feet on making the payment.

972
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,280
Why do you ask me to accompany you?

973
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,439
I'm just thinking that

974
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,280
you're pregnant.

975
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,520
Mr Lin won't reject my request

976
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,959
if you come with me.

977
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,879
Anyway, you're not busy these days,

978
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,360
why don't you come with me?

979
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,280
Are you trying to use me to gain sympathy?

980
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,120
I guess that might work a little.

981
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,639
Why don't you break your arm?

982
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,719
Mr Lin would be more sympathetic

983
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,399
if he knew.

984
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,199
Okay, okay.

985
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,159
I'm sorry.

986
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,399
Forget it

987
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,560
Watch out for your baby.

988
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:20,960
That's ridiculous.

989
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,480
Mom,

990
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,639
when are we going back to our house?

991
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,839
When did you

992
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,040
pack your bags?

993
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,400
I just unpacked all the clothes.

994
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,759
I'm going to stay at

995
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:40,319
Grandma's for a few more days.

996
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,520
But I'm homesick,

997
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
and miss my dad.

998
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,199
Xiongxiong,

999
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:50,440
I haven't been

1000
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,000
feeling well

1001
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,239
since Little Watermelon was born.

1002
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,000
I want to stay at Grandma and

1003
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Grandpa's place for a few more days.

1004
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:58,920
Could you

1005
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,080
stay here

1006
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,960
with Mommy

1007
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,880
and Little Watermelon?

1008
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,719
Mom,

1009
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,520
did you

1010
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,239
have another fight with Dad?

1011
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,839
Come on, Little Watermelon.

1012
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,239
Look at your aunt.

1013
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,679
She's here.

1014
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,679
Now, where's she?

1015
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:37,199
There, there.

1016
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,159
You're ignoring your aunt.

1017
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:38,639
Come on.

1018
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,520
Here, here.

1019
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,199
Little Watermelon,

1020
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,080
your aunt's here.

1021
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,600
She,

1022
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,120
she is here.

1023
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,279
Wait, wait, wait.

1024
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,799
My goodness.

1025
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,199
My goodness.

1026
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:51,440
What's going on?

1027
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,199
Give me a hand

1028
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:52,799
No, no.

1029
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:53,880
Get down here.

1030
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
Is there something wrong with the device?

1031
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,839
You look so cute, don't you?

1032
00:35:58,839 --> 00:35:59,960
You freaked us out.

1033
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,719
You're intentional.

1034
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,159
Give me a break,

1035
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:02,600
you...

1036
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,359
[Dad, Mom says she's]

1037
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,679
[staying at Grandma's for a long time,]

1038
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
[but I want to go home.]

1039
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,400
[I miss you.]

1040
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,400
[Dad,]

1041
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,799
[when are you coming to]

1042
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:19,520
[see me at Grandma's?]

1043
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:20,560
[Dad.]

1044
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,560
Don't cry.

1045
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,279
Good girl, let me hug you.

1046
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,759
What are you doing?

1047
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm in a daze.

1048
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,679
Really?

1049
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,719
How about accompanying me

1050
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,799
outside for a walk?

1051
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,199
Can I buy a lollipop?

1052
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,560
If you behave well,

1053
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,040
I'll buy you two.

1054
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,520
Thank you, mom.

1055
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,199
I'm going to change my clothes.

1056
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:12,600
Wait for a moment.

1057
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,199
Dad!

1058
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,440
You're here!

1059
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Dad, did you come to pick me up?

1060
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,040
Son,

1061
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,279
don't you like staying at grandma's?

1062
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,040
Stay a little longer.

1063
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:24,480
No.

1064
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,839
Stop it.

1065
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,600
I want to go home! I want to go home!

1066
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,000
Stop it.

1067
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
No, I'm going home.

1068
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Stay here to accompany your sister.

1069
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,920
Don't you want to stay here longer?

1070
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,000
I brought you your things.

1071
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,880
Jia Haowen, what do you mean?

1072
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,000
Nothing.

1073
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,400
I'm going on a long trip.

1074
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,719
Dad!

1075
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,400
Dad, don't leave!

1076
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:32,960
I'm good.

1077
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,239
Stay here.

1078
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,319
Yunjie.

1079
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm here.

1080
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,040
Look, Yunjie.

1081
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,920
Your Auntie made you fermented rice buns.

1082
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,920
Have some.

1083
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,679
Thank you, Auntie.

1084
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,279
Aren't you joining us?

1085
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll take He Lu's car to go to school.

1086
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,120
See you later.

1087
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:37,480
You asked for it.

1088
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,159
Are you two still

1089
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:43,319
not talking to each other?

1090
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,600
It's Yunjie

1091
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,560
who gave me the silent treatment.

1092
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,040
That's tricky.

1093
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,000
Lin,

1094
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,080
do you think I did the wrong thing?

1095
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,080
Anyway, my daughter is right.

1096
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,600
Then I'm not wrong either.

1097
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,359
Zhu Kexin's family

1098
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,600
is having a tough time.

1099
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,480
Can't we be more lenient with her?

1100
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,759
Zhu Kexin made the mistake at first.

1101
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Yunjie only wants

1102
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,080
a face-to-face apology.

1103
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,359
It's a simple request.

1104
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,839
I don't get what you mean

1105
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,239
by being more lenient with her.

1106
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,520
So,

1107
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,880
what should I do?

1108
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,679
Please don't rely on me.

1109
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,679
You've got to resolve it yourself.

1110
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,839
Find a way out for Yunjie to forgive you.

1111
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,279
How?

1112
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,279
Shall I spell it out for you?

1113
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,400
What does Yunjie enjoy?

1114
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,359
What's her favorite food?

1115
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,080
In dealing with our matters,

1116
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,239
you have to have my back.

1117
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I'll make sure to support you.

1118
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:45,839
Deal.

1119
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:47,199
Come on.

1120
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:54,440
Here it is.

1121
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,199
I made some rice cakes.

1122
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,600
After you guys finish work today,

1123
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,239
remember to pick up Yunjie from school

1124
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,279
and take her to her grandpa's for dinner.

1125
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,639
I've got to look after Xin's baby.

1126
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,279
Don't bother.

1127
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,120
If you can't come back to cook,

1128
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,239
I can do it.

1129
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,719
I'm not busy at work right now.

1130
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:14,799
Forget it.

1131
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:16,239
Is your cooking edible?

1132
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll do it.

1133
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,319
Whatever. Either one of you can do it.

1134
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,520
I'm okay with that.

1135
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:26,960
Meng'an,

1136
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,960
I've got something to tell you.

1137
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:30,600
I've noticed

1138
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,679
something's up with Xin.

1139
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,839
What's up with her?

1140
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,880
Let me tell you.

1141
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,239
She's been acting stubborn,

1142
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,359
always up for an argument,

1143
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:40,960
and quick to lose her temper.

1144
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,159
These are

1145
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:45,080
all signs of postpartum depression.

1146
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,480
I have experience in caregiving,

1147
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,480
and I understand that

1148
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,080
when someone is

1149
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,839
physically uncomfortable,

1150
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,359
they can quickly become irritable.

1151
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,000
If their family neglects them,

1152
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,719
their condition will worsen.

1153
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:00,719
Who neglects Xin?

1154
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,199
The whole family is good to her.

1155
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Where did your

1156
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,400
sharpness go?

1157
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,880
You've become slow-minded now.

1158
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,799
Xin had her second kid,

1159
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:14,520
and now everyone's

1160
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,839
all about the baby.

1161
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,199
Is she feeling overlooked?

1162
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:24,040
So,

1163
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,440
we have to show her some extra love.

1164
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,319
Yes,

1165
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:28,679
that's what I mean.

1166
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:29,839
When you're available,

1167
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,799
regularly visit Xin

1168
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,239
and catch up with her.

1169
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:34,639
Okay,

1170
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,239
I got it.

1171
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:37,279
Come on.

1172
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,839
You're right.

1173
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,960
Xin has gone through a lot

1174
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,600
to have a second baby.

1175
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,319
Don't eat the egg yolks.

1176
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,040
Oh, you take this.

1177
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:52,679
Okay.

1178
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,520
Have one more?

1179
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,319
Why are you being so quiet today?

1180
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:18,239
Would you like to listen to some music

1181
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:19,440
or a lecture?

1182
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:21,120
No, I don't think so.

1183
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,239
I can sense

1184
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,080
the emotions

1185
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,040
they were expressing earlier.
