1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available.

2
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,280
Just in Time EP03

3
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,160
Come on, come on.

4
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,760
Let me get you some honey water.

5
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,639
I don't want any.

6
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:16,999
You…

7
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:17,760
Why not tell me

8
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,199
you went to Beijing?

9
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,240
I did tell you. I said I was going.

10
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,400
You said you were still thinking about it.

11
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,839
Well, I made up my mind and went.

12
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,800
Why not me before you left?

13
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,639
I was in a rush.

14
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,880
How do I know you were really in Beijing

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,400
for a meeting?

16
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,279
Li Lin...

17
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,279
What's this?

18
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,360
Tell me.

19
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,879
You found it?

20
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,279
You already found it?

21
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,640
Got a little carried away

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,960
last night.

23
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,039
You...

24
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,279
At your age,

25
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,640
you're still doing this?

26
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,039
Aren't you ashamed?

27
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,400
I was just trying

28
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,879
to prove my innocence.

29
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,839
Don't you have concealer?

30
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,439
You could

31
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,200
use some to cover it up.

32
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,800
You know about concealer?

33
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,800
Anyway,

34
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,240
what's up with you?

35
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,159
Why'd you get so drunk last night?

36
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:52,599
Work stressing you out?

37
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,839
You even cried.

38
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,839
I hardly ever see you like this.

39
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,640
Feel bad?

40
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:08,800
My heart aches for you.

41
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,559
Fine.

42
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,599
I forgive you.

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,319
I'm skipping the meal later.

44
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:17,920
Got a date.

45
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,599
With whom?

46
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,999
A guy.

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,559
A guy?

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Maybe don't use that concealer after all.

49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,120
The response from the lower-tier markets

50
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,319
has been really positive.

51
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,639
So we've got that going.

52
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:08,920
Alright, let's go with that.

53
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,199
Head back to the office and wait for me.

54
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,959
Got it.

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,559
Okay.

56
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,079
Hey, old monitor,

57
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,399
you actually called me first.

58
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm honored.

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Come on.

60
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,519
Have a bite.

61
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,800
I saw Wanzhen last night.

62
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,040
And I found out

63
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,079
you've been too busy

64
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,480
to get back home.

65
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,800
She complained to you?

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
I've got my own grievances too.

67
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,600
Seriously.

68
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
I was in a business negotiation

69
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,040
when she suddenly called

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
saying she couldn't pick up the kids

71
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,240
and asked me to do it.

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,319
But hey,

73
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,879
nothing's more important

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
than the kids,

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,639
so I went

76
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,439
and picked my kids up.

77
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,199
But then what happened?

78
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,399
By the time I got back,

79
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,160
the deal was off,

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,280
and someone else swooped in.

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
All those months

82
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,280
of hard work were wasted.

83
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,040
If you were me,

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,399
wouldn't you be mad?

85
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,639
You just said it yourself,

86
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,600
nothing's more important than the kids.

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
So why get upset?

88
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,879
But we agreed back then,

89
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,319
she handles the home, and I focus on work.

90
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,399
The reason I work so hard

91
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,319
is all for her

92
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,319
and the kid.

93
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,079
Enough.

94
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,079
Stop complaining here.

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
She's raising two kids by herself

96
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,639
with no help.

97
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,480
You can try it

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
and see how long you'd endure it?

99
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,240
Okay, okay, fine!

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,840
I was wrong, alright?

101
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,319
You're always right,

102
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,639
my dear monitor.

103
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,480
Happy now?

104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Back to business.

105
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,399
What do you need from me?

106
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,399
It's more than just this, right?

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,879
I've got a meeting

108
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,720
upstairs soon.

109
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,199
Do me a favor.

110
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:30,959
What is it?

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,319
Xinmiao's situation

112
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,240
isn't looking good.

113
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,639
They're planning layoffs.

114
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,199
It's not just Xinmiao that's struggling.

115
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
Everyone's having a hard time.

116
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,480
Are you alright?

117
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,519
I'm fine.

118
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,199
But my team,

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
I've led them for a long time.

120
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
They're all excellent.

121
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,439
So, I wanted to recommend them to you.

122
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,079
What's that got to do with me?

123
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,720
Not much to do with you,

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
but it matters to me. Please?

125
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
Just as a favor.

126
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,680
Alright, alright, fine! I'll help.

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,280
I'll send you their resumes later.

128
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,040
Okay.

129
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,319
Send them over,

130
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll have HR review them.

131
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,920
I'll keep the useful ones,

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,280
but no promises.

133
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,120
I can't guarantee

134
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
everyone will be kept.

135
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,079
Just take as many as you can.

136
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,319
Thanks a lot.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,399
No need.

138
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,319
Grab a bite with me?

139
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,240
No, thanks.

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,800
That's all about the favor.

141
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,639
Gotta head out now.

142
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,720
Alright, bye.

143
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,040
Where's your ring?

144
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,879
I don't like wearing it.

145
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,879
It feels uncomfortable.

146
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,600
I suggest you wear it.

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Don't forget who you are.

148
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,639
And who am I?

149
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
A married man.

150
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,399
Alright, quit messing around. I know.

151
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Send me those resumes.

152
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,160
So, who do you think

153
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,559
will be on the next layoff list

154
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,439
from Director Xu?

155
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,519
Even Qian Qian got cut.

156
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,600
He,

157
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
you're definitely next.

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,439
Mu,

159
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,680
you're good at buttering people up.

160
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,800
Got any insider info?

161
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,079
Sun, come with me.

162
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,399
Anyone else?

163
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,840
It's okay.

164
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,840
Let's go together.

165
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:18,759
Director Xu,

166
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:19,799
thank you.

167
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,600
I already got

168
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,279
an interview notice from Blue Ocean.

169
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,240
I have a recommendation letter here.

170
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,320
Take it with you.

171
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
This is as much as

172
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
I can help you with.

173
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,440
The rest

174
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,279
is up to you.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,639
Thank you, Director Xu.

176
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
I really appreciate it.

177
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,720
Thank you for everything you've done for Xinmiao.

178
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
I don't agree with the negotiation.

179
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,320
Hiring and firing whenever you want?

180
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,320
My contract isn't even up yet.

181
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
How can you fire me?

182
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,879
I'm telling you,

183
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,519
I'm not leaving.

184
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,360
Can't we discuss this calmly?

185
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,360
Xu Meng'an,

186
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,720
Stop pretending

187
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
to be innocent here.

188
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,879
Tell me,

189
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:57,759
was the layoff list

190
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,639
decided by you?

191
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,960
Why did you choose to fire us?

192
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,799
The reasons for your layoff

193
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,360
are clearly stated in the notice.

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,159
If you don't mind,

195
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,080
you can share them

196
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,240
and let everyone judge.

197
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm telling you, Xu Meng'an,

198
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,039
we're not satisfied

199
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,039
with your decision.

200
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,080
We're not leaving.

201
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
Everyone!

202
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
I bet you all know

203
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,679
how we've worked

204
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
day in and day out.

205
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,399
Working diligently and without complaint,

206
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,519
overtime and all.

207
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,080
And this is how it ends?

208
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,840
Think about it, everyone.

209
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,759
Could this be your fate too?

210
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,039
Did you really work diligently?

211
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,720
Did you really work without complaint?

212
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,960
The company's compensation

213
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,720
wasn't lacking, was it?

214
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,159
Not lacking.

215
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,600
If this outcome

216
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,080
is still unacceptable to you,

217
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,440
you can go through judicial process.

218
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,519
I'll be there every step of the way.

219
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,999
But if you want to spread rumors

220
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:43,960
and stir up trouble here,

221
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,960
I will call the police.

222
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,159
He,

223
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
still batting those innocent eyes?

224
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
Don't you know?

225
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,759
You're next in line for the layoff.

226
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:54,679
Right?

227
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,360
Director Xu.

228
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,279
Director Xu,

229
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,039
is that true?

230
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,039
Xu Meng'an,

231
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,240
you say we were late and left early,

232
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,039
fine.

233
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,080
We missed our targets.

234
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
But He, early in, late out,

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,360
working overtime, and even sleeping here!

236
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,639
Did she make any mistake?

237
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,080
Why should she be fired?

238
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
Director Xu,

239
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,639
please don't fire me.

240
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:15,999
Don't make a scene.

241
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,560
Are you trying to morally blackmail me?

242
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,159
Are you still the He

243
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,080
that I used to know?

244
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,200
Director Xu,

245
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,519
can you give me another chance?

246
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,799
Do you think chances

247
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,639
are something you can get

248
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,639
whenever you want?

249
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,519
I have a few words

250
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,600
to say today.

251
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,720
Regarding the layoffs,

252
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,600
I know everyone

253
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,720
is feeling uneasy.

254
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't really have the standing

255
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,560
to console everyone.

256
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,519
But today,

257
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,320
whether you're leaving

258
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,639
or staying,

259
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,360
I hope you'll all think about this,

260
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,759
really think about it:

261
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,600
Who is responsible

262
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,919
for today's outcome?

263
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,759
We're all adults,

264
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
and we should be accountable

265
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,999
for our actions, right?

266
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,159
Rachel,

267
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,519
come with me for a moment.

268
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,159
Alright, enough.

269
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
The layoffs were a company decision.

270
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,720
What could Director Xu do about it?

271
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
She's not happy about it either.

272
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,759
Do you know how

273
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,960
we got our salary this month?

274
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,399
The whole company took pay cuts,

275
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,560
except our department.

276
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:58,600
Do you really think

277
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,440
you did well?

278
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,320
It was Director Xu

279
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
who didn't take two months of pay

280
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,399
to make up for us.

281
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,480
If you don't believe it,

282
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,840
you can ask finance.

283
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,639
Li, Sun,

284
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:11,960
stop making a fuss.

285
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,519
It's good enough that we got compensation.

286
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,200
Shameful.

287
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,560
Director Xu got you

288
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,360
the best compensation package.

289
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,999
If there's no issue,

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,039
just sign here.

291
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,639
Here.

292
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,279
And

293
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,240
this recommendation letter

294
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,639
is from Director Xu.

295
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Originally, Director Xu

296
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,440
wanted to give it to you personally,

297
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,999
but your behavior just now

298
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,320
was really hurtful.

299
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,960
If I were her,

300
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,759
I wouldn't give this to you.

301
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,039
You should really think about

302
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,039
how many chances she's given you.

303
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,159
She's done enough to help you.

304
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,120
If it were up to me,

305
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,519
you would've been laid off long ago.

306
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,320
Hey, Jun.

307
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,320
Long time no see.

308
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,759
Are you having trouble finding Li Lin?

309
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,519
Meng'an,

310
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
do you and Li Lin still need money?

311
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,480
What money?

312
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,519
Li borrowed money from me.

313
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,279
I was short on cash,

314
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,039
so I couldn't lend it to him.

315
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,320
I felt a bit embarrassed.

316
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,320
Recently, I managed to gather some money.

317
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,039
If you  need it, you can use it.

318
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,999
Li borrowed money from you?

319
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,120
You didn't know about this?

320
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:47,720
Well...

321
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,960
forget I said anything.

322
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,879
Hello?

323
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:50,999
Hello?

324
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,120
Hello, leaders.

325
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,240
Director, take a look.

326
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,320
These pieces of equipment...

327
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,080
...aren't they nice?

328
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,519
What do you think?

329
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,560
These models are all the latest.

330
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,039
This one is really good.

331
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,440
Hey, Li Lin!

332
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,560
Hey, senior!

333
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,320
What are you doing here?

334
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,399
I'm adjusting the equipment.

335
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,399
Mr. Ma,

336
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,720
you know him?

337
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,399
Li is my junior with the same mentor.

338
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,320
It's been ages since we last met.

339
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,200
Yeah.

340
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,919
You never drop by the campus to see me.

341
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,639
How've you been lately?

342
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,480
Pretty good.

343
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,600
Good.

344
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,480
Glad to hear it.

345
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,639
Mr. Ma,

346
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,999
The leader is already here.

347
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,519
We should head over.

348
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,080
Alright.

349
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,840
Li, don't forget

350
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,840
to come by the school sometime.

351
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,919
Let's catch up.

352
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,560
For sure, for sure.

353
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,039
Don't forget.

354
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,759
Absolutely.

355
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,240
That's good.

356
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,080
You got it.

357
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,399
Mr. Li,

358
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,399
So you're Mr. Ma's junior?

359
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,120
Great!

360
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,199
Mr. Li's been gone from the company

361
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,040
for a while.

362
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,760
The company's transitioning now.

363
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,159
The department Mr. Li was in charge of...

364
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,320
They laid off everyone there.

365
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,159
Such a shame.

366
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:43,159
I heard he's been freelancing

367
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,040
with one of the companies

368
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:45,959
we used to outsource to.

369
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,000
Doing odd jobs,

370
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,159
fixing equipment and stuff.

371
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,520
He didn't tell you any of this?

372
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,919
What's up with that?

373
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,280
Off to see a client?

374
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,719
You're doing sales now?

375
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,959
Boss wants me to tag along.

376
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,120
I couldn't really say no.

377
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,919
Competition's fierce these days.

378
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,760
R&D's important,

379
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,719
but the market's crucial too.

380
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:06,840
Just leave it there.

381
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:07,919
I'll be back soon.

382
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,560
You'll be back soon?

383
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:12,919
Just to see a client.

384
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,159
It won't take me long time.

385
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,719
I'll come back, chill for a bit,

386
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,800
then head to the office in the afternoon.

387
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,159
Where am I dropping you today?

388
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,600
Me?

389
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm heading down with Yunjie.

390
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,080
Just drop me with her.

391
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,879
Hey, Meng'an?

392
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,159
Are you at the office?

393
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,040
Nope,

394
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,520
I just left, actually.

395
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:31,120
Well,

396
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm on a call at Tianheng Tower.

397
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,399
What's up? Need something?

398
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,159
Nope. Catch up later.

399
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,399
Come on, time to eat.

400
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,040
Alright.

401
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:45,679
Okay.

402
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:47,199
Thanks.

403
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,159
Mr. Zhao,

404
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,040
Here,

405
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:50,760
I...

406
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,639
It's yours.

407
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,800
Thanks for putting up with this.

408
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,560
No problem at all.

409
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,360
See,

410
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,360
Thank you for your hard work.

411
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,159
Thank you

412
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:01,919
It's no problem.

413
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,879
If you need anything

414
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:04,919
with the equipment,

415
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,399
just let me know anytime.

416
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,919
That's great!

417
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,919
Thanks, thanks, thanks a lot!

418
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:09,840
It's nothing, really.

419
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,439
Enjoy your meal.

420
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,120
I'll leave you to it.

421
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,320
Okay.

422
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
You all, hurry up to eat.

423
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,439
After you're done, tidy up.

424
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,199
Take your time.

425
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,639
Why are you here?

426
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,879
On an assignment?

427
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,000
It's full.

428
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,719
How long are you planning to keep this up?

429
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,520
How long has it been?

430
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,000
It's been a while.

431
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,159
I was planning to

432
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:08,760
tell you

433
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
after I find a job.

434
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,199
After you find a job?

435
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,320
I didn't expect

436
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,439
it's really not easy to

437
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,600
find a job these days.

438
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,520
So what have you been up to?

439
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,239
Just doing odd jobs.

440
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,040
It's like...

441
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,719
my previous company,

442
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,600
and some other collaborations...

443
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,719
They needed our equipment,

444
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,919
so I helped them set it up.

445
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,159
They called me in

446
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,239
to lend a hand.

447
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,159
and gave me some

448
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:47,679
payment.

449
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
How are you managing the mortgage?

450
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,560
I had

451
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,040
some savings from before.

452
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,919
But lately...

453
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,320
Things have been a bit tight

454
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,959
these last couple of months.

455
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,560
So, I was thinking

456
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,760
borrowing some money

457
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,159
Borrow money?

458
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,479
And you still planning to go to Beijing?

459
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,520
For what?

460
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,199
Thinking of moving back to Beijing?

461
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,239
Me?

462
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,120
Why would I move to Beijing?

463
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,959
You and Yunjie are here.

464
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,320
Why would I go to Beijing?

465
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm just going for

466
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,600
an industry conference.

467
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,800
It's a good chance

468
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,199
to meet people,

469
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,600
and maybe find some job opportunities.

470
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,840
Actually, this time,

471
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,520
I ran into some old classmates.

472
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,159
They're all big bosses now.

473
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,320
We had a good talk,

474
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,399
and we will meet again

475
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,239
in a few days.

476
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,919
Maybe something will come up.

477
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:00,760
Feeling confident?

478
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,320
Yes.

479
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:02,520
Absolutely.

480
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:03,959
So, you need to

481
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,959
have faith in me too.

482
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,280
I have an interview

483
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,399
next week.

484
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,600
Maybe it'll lead to a job.

485
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,879
It's ready.

486
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,439
We can eat.

487
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,000
You can have it.

488
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,959
I've got work to do.

489
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,600
I have to go.

490
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,080
Haowen.

491
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,719
Are you free tonight?

492
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,520
Come over to my place.

493
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,159
I need to talk to you about something.

494
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:18,320
Waiter,

495
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,560
can I get this to-go?

496
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,360
Something happened.

497
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,239
What happened?

498
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,840
Someone took photos and screenshots

499
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,959
and reported the matter to Mr. Zhang.

500
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
They said you plan

501
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
to take Qianqian to Blue Ocean.

502
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,919
And before the layoffs,

503
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,800
you already met with Mr. Yu

504
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,360
and discussed the terms.

505
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,959
Don't mind it.

506
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,520
Just some rumors.

507
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,600
It's not even true.

508
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,520
But Mr. Zhang believed it!

509
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,479
Do you know what Mr. Zhang

510
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,719
did this morning?

511
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,320
He went to play golf with Mr. Yu.

512
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,760
He hasn't played in a long time.

513
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
His golf bag was gathering dust.

514
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,239
What does that tell you?

515
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,840
He's probing.

516
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,239
What do you mean by that?

517
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,360
I mean,

518
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,199
doesn't he trust me at all?

519
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,159
Not even a little?

520
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,360
The problem is, right now,

521
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,919
the company is full of rumors.

522
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,560
I think you really need to go talk to him

523
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,120
and make your position clear.

524
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:33,399
Mr. Zhang.

525
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,320
I'm here to clarify something.

526
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,639
Clarify what?

527
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,760
You mentored me from the start.

528
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
As long as you don't want me to leave,

529
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
I won't leave.

530
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,080
Are you

531
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,800
hearing rumors?

532
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,199
Who's been saying what?

533
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,280
Rachel.

534
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,120
I knew it was this chick.

535
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,639
Meng'an,

536
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,560
you need to understand me, too.

537
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,360
You know the current state of the company.

538
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,000
If you really leave,

539
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,399
the company would collapse.

540
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,600
Are you relieved now?

541
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,239
Yes, I am.

542
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,840
I won't hit the balls tomorrow.

543
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,159
I'll get back to work now.

544
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,840
Rachel.

545
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,320
Come here for a moment.

546
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,439
So, how is it?

547
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,959
Beautiful.

548
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,679
I think it'll definitely work

549
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,639
if you go like this tomorrow.

550
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,120
I think so.

551
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:21,879
I gotta

552
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:23,239
present myself well anyway.

553
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,439
I never expected

554
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:28,159
that you're so close

555
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,360
with the HR Director

556
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,040
and could do this for me.

557
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Rachel and I are allies.

558
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,679
I can give you some advice.

559
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,840
If the situation permits,

560
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,399
in the company,

561
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:40,639
you may also find an ally.

562
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,479
Sometimes,

563
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,879
it's good to relieve work pressure,

564
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,439
and analyze the company's situation.

565
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,639
But in the early stages

566
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
of such a relationship,

567
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,040
you shouldn't consider her as your bestie.

568
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:52,760
Got it?

569
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,639
Yeah.

570
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,719
She's here.

571
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,000
Which one?

572
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,560
The one in the mini skirt.

573
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,239
Are you sure

574
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,840
she's the HR Director?

575
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,280
Don't be fooled

576
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,040
by her appearance.

577
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,760
Although she dresses like that,

578
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,600
she's ruthless.

579
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,679
In our industry,

580
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,239
many high-profile people

581
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,639
have been taken down by her.

582
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,679
She could definitely

583
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,919
give you some pointers.

584
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,760
Woah!

585
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,159
Here she comes.

586
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,560
Rachel!

587
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,320
Let me introduce.

588
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,199
This is my best friend, Chen Wanzhen.

589
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,840
And this is also my bestie, Rachel.

590
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:45,719
Rachel, nice to meet you.

591
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:46,919
Nice to meet you, too.

592
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:49,120
Please, have a seat.

593
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:52,919
Here you go.

594
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,520
Very well-dressed.

595
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,879
And you look great.

596
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,159
Thank you.

597
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,399
Take off your jewelry.

598
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,959
If you're applying for

599
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,959
an entry-level position,

600
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,159
don't wear anything too expensive.

601
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,959
It should fit the role.

602
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,199
So maybe tomorrow,

603
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,719
you may wear something

604
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
cheaper.

605
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:34,639
Got it.

606
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,919
Here's her resume.

607
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,120
Could you take a look?

608
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,520
This resume isn't good enough.

609
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,600
Why?

610
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,399
I already checked it.

611
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,840
Writing a resume

612
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,639
isn't just about

613
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,399
listing where you were and when.

614
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:03,840
The key is

615
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:04,719
where were you

616
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,719
and what you accomplished there.

617
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
Is it ok to write it

618
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,120
in an exaggerate way?

619
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,840
On the condition that it's truthful,

620
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,040
a little embellishment is fine.

621
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:26,120
Introduce yourself.

622
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,560
My name is Chen Wanzhen.

623
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,239
I graduated from Jiangnan University,

624
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,919
majoring in Economics and Management.

625
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:31,959
I've worked at…

626
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:32,399
Stop.

627
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,000
Don't repeat what's on your resume.

628
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,439
When I ask you this question,

629
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,320
I want to know your strengths

630
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,320
and how well you match the position.

631
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,600
Think about it,

632
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,199
and answer

633
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:49,159
the interviewer tomorrow.

634
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,120
Okay.

635
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,520
I'll ask you two more questions.

636
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,600
Why do you want to join our company?

637
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,120
I've researched your company,

638
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:02,840
and the position I'm applying for.

639
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,959
I believe I have the skills

640
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,360
to excel in this role.

641
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,520
Not bad.

642
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,760
Looks like you've had a deep understanding of

643
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,479
the company

644
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,840
and the position.

645
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:14,919
Tell me about the projects you worked on.

646
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
I assume this question is asking about

647
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,679
my approach to the projects

648
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,719
and the contributions I made, not just

649
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:24,560
describing the projects themselves.

650
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:25,800
Isn't it?

651
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,760
Meng'an, your friend has potential.

652
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,360
Though she has a few years of work gap,

653
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,639
her ability to grasp things is sharp.

654
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,280
I just asked her three questions,

655
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:38,439
and for two of them,

656
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,959
she understood exactly what I needed.

657
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,760
I think for the administrative role,

658
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,639
her educational background

659
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,520
is enough.

660
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,520
It shouldn't be a problem.

661
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,560
Thank you.

662
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
Any other questions?

663
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,439
When it comes to the interview,

664
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,719
is it okay to discuss salary?

665
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,000
Of course.

666
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,560
Within the limits

667
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,959
of what HR can decide,

668
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,560
you should confidently bring it up.

669
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,639
If you don't,

670
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,959
they might think

671
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:15,879
you lack the confidence

672
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,120
to handle the position.

673
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,199
Meng'an mentioned that you were

674
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,719
a stay-at-home mom for a few years.

675
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:23,199
You can be humble with us,

676
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,080
but

677
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,159
in front of them,

678
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,600
never show weakness.

679
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,800
If they even catch

680
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,159
a hint of weakness,

681
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,000
they'll definitely try

682
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,840
to lowball you.

683
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,000
So, do you think the reason

684
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,040
I haven't been promoted or had a raise

685
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,600
these past few years

686
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,239
is because I showed weakness?

687
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,439
Next time,

688
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,159
I'll give you more pointers.

689
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,959
Lastly, let me remind you again.

690
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,199
Do you know what you should

691
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,600
and shouldn't say?

692
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,040
What should I say?

693
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,040
What shouldn't I say?

694
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,399
Say less of what should say.

695
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,760
Say nothing

696
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:11,879
of what you shouldn't say.

697
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,360
Come in, please.

698
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,360
Take it easy.

699
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,600
Here.

700
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,320
Are you Director Sun?

701
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:49,600
You're here for the interview, right?

702
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,360
I'm Chen Wanzhen,

703
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:53,399
recommended by Director Xu of Xinmiao.

704
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,800
You're Meng'an's referral.

705
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,600
Here's my resume.

706
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,760
Hello, Ms. Chen.

707
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,360
Director Xu

708
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:03,320
has already

709
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,360
told me about your resume.

710
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,760
Your education

711
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,320
and work experience

712
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,919
are very impressive.

713
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,520
But the job we have here,

714
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
you might find it

715
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,520
a bit mismatched for your skills.

716
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,719
I just need someone for admin work,

717
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,360
basically

718
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,919
someone to handle miscellaneous tasks.

719
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,239
You might find it beneath your talents.

720
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,239
That's fine.

721
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,560
Director Sun, to be honest,

722
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,800
I haven't worked for a long time.

723
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,040
And going back to my previous field

724
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,320
is really tough.

725
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,320
But this,

726
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,760
daily office work,

727
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,919
I can handle that.

728
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,280
How old is your child?

729
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,000
Eight years old.

730
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,239
Eight.

731
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,400
Actually,

732
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,120
our internal work

733
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,839
is pretty good too.

734
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,679
Well,

735
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,359
it just involves

736
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,719
supporting the sales department.

737
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,960
And if you can,

738
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,759
bring in clients

739
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,159
to buy properties,

740
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,239
you'll get a commission.

741
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,319
Great.

742
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,199
Sure. See,

743
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,600
we've just moved to the sales office.

744
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,159
It's a bit messy.

745
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,319
I won't be able to make reception right now.

746
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:57,199
Come by some other day

747
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:58,839
to complete your onboarding.

748
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,600
I can start anytime.

749
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,159
Let me help you now.

750
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,359
No need.

751
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,799
No, no.

752
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,440
I'm good at this.

753
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,000
You needn't to do this work right away.

754
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,319
No need.

755
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:08,120
It's alright. It's alright.

756
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,560
These minor tasks

757
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,920
are part of my job anyway.

758
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,239
Then thank you.

759
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:12,600
You're welcome.

760
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,040
Thank you.

761
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:13,920
Sun,

762
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,040
has the copier been installed?

763
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,040
The after-sales servicer we scheduled hasn't arrived.

764
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,239
We can't use it yet.

765
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,040
We'll have to wait.

766
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:21,759
Well...

767
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,520
Let me give it a try.

768
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:24,920
This model of copier

769
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,839
is the same as the one at my home.

770
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,159
That would be great.

771
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,000
We're bad with the electric appliances,

772
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,319
We are old.

773
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,520
Let me introduce.

774
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,120
This is our new internal staff member,

775
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,279
Ms. Chen Wanzhen.

776
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,639
Hello, Ms. Chen.

777
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,440
Hello.

778
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:48,839
Here.

779
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:49,279
Sure.

780
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:00,679
Done.

781
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,120
Okay.

782
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,759
Thank you.

783
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,719
You're welcome.

784
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,839
Impressive!

785
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,639
Now, about this

786
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,000
network issue, it seems to be a bit off.

787
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,120
Can you check it?

788
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:12,759
No problem.

789
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:21,600
I always thought that

790
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,239
girls aren't good

791
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:24,400
with these things.

792
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,600
You're quite skilled, though.

793
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:26,719
Over the years, at home,

794
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,000
I had to do everything myself.

795
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,319
That's how I got good at it.

796
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,880
Alright.

797
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,319
The account and password are set.

798
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,199
Done?

799
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:40,159
Good!

800
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,600
From now on,

801
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:42,759
all the tasks at the sales office

802
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:43,799
will be your responsibility.

803
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,359
Thank you, Sun.

804
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,440
Director Xu,

805
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,319
here are the materials you requested.

806
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:50,799
Great.

807
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,239
You can head home now.

808
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,719
It's almost time to clock out.

809
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,880
I haven't finished the project proposal...

810
00:36:56,759 --> 00:36:57,600
I'll handle it.

811
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,520
We're short on staff lately.

812
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,639
You've been working overtime for days.

813
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,520
Go home early.

814
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,040
Let me take on some of your workload.

815
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:04,600
No need.

816
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:05,759
I can handle it myself.

817
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,920
Thank you for your hard work.

818
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,839
Thank you, Director Xu.

819
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,719
Hello, Ms. Xue.

820
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:19,639
Hello, Mrs. Li.

821
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,440
Yunjie's monthly exam results

822
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,199
come out today.

823
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,319
Did you know?

824
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,159
I don't know yet.

825
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:26,239
I'll ask Yunjie and her dad

826
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,400
when I get back.

827
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,440
...the results this time

828
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
aren't very good.

829
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,520
I still want to discuss it with you.

830
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,359
There are some things that are

831
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:34,960
difficult to talk about with her dad.

832
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,120
Is it because Yunjie was affected

833
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,359
by that boy pursuing her?

834
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:42,159
No, no, Mrs. Li.

835
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,719
Let's not jump to conclusions

836
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,920
about the child.

837
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,400
I'm calling you

838
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:46,960
not because of

839
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,520
this exam's results...

840
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,880
...but because I hope you

841
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,799
pay more attention to

842
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,880
and understand your child.

843
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,560
Teenage girls

844
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,480
need their mothers

845
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,159
to be more concerned.

846
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,159
Yes, yes.

847
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,759
Yunjie's matters

848
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:01,199
have always been handled by her dad...

849
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,560
...and you know that.

850
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,319
Father's heart

851
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,719
is usually bigger.

852
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,319
This is a critical moment

853
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:08,400
that determines the child's future.

854
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,440
I believe,

855
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,960
for a family,

856
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,839
the child is the most important.

857
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,799
Don't you think so?

858
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:14,359
Yes.

859
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,520
I'll find out when I get back.

860
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,440
Thank you.

861
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,239
Stop.

862
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,440
What's the use of cleaning it?

863
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,199
Where's Yunjie?

864
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:00,839
She went...

865
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,040
...to play with He Lu.

866
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,159
Still daring to go out and have fun?

867
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,279
Did Ms. Xue call you?

868
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,199
She called me.

869
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
Do you know why she didn't call you?

870
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:13,080
It means you're not looking after

871
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,040
the child well enough.

872
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:18,679
Ms. Xue said

873
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,600
that Yunjie's exam results

874
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,440
weren't good

875
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:21,600
because of early relationships.

876
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,520
How are you usually looking after her?

877
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,759
Yunjie told me

878
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,799
that she didn't do well in this exam.

879
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:31,159
but it has nothing to do

880
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,040
with the relationships.

881
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,719
Ms. Xue called you

882
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:34,639
mainly because

883
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,159
of the girl's issues.

884
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,560
It's better talk to you.

885
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
Are you sure?

886
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,839
Yeah.

887
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:40,560
Then why didn't you discuss

888
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,799
your unemployment with me?

889
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,480
If I hadn't gone

890
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,440
to your company today,

891
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,799
I wouldn't have known

892
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:47,239
what you've been up to recently.

893
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Let's keep things separate.

894
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:51,080
Now let's focus on your issue.

895
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,359
Don't think you can hide your secrets.

896
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,359
I know why you went to Beijing.

897
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,600
I know who you met.

898
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Mei Yiduo, right?

899
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,759
For what reason you met with her?

900
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,040
To help you find a job?

901
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,960
Did she help?

902
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,639
Someone knocks the door.

903
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
You don't need to hide.

904
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,040
This day was bound to come.

905
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,279
Hey!

906
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,520
Hello, Uncle.

907
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:10,759
Hi, Brother-in-law.

908
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:11,199
Where's Haowen?

909
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,960
He is coming.

910
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:12,759
Sis.

911
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:13,679
Come in.

912
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:14,359
Come in.

913
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:15,319
What brings you here?

914
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,839
Sis.

915
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:17,679
We brought some seafood.

916
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:18,920
Mom and Dad said it's really delicious.

917
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,960
We brought some for you

918
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,480
Great, great!

919
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,199
Come on in.

920
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:21,600
Sure thing.

921
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,880
I didn't change my shoes.

922
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,639
Let your brother-in-law to bother anyway.

923
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:26,960
He's taken to cleaning lately.

924
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,279
Really?

925
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Look at this place.

926
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,759
It's cluttered everywhere.

927
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,400
Isn't it cramped with you all living here?

928
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,120
You've only just been in a big house.

929
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:37,639
Complaining about everything...

930
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:39,239
Why don't you move to Mom's place for now?

931
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,359
At least it's more spacious there.

932
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,839
When will you move into the new house?

933
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,600
Maybe in a year.

934
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:46,359
There's still renovation to be done.

935
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,199
How much did you loan?

936
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,960
I heard from Mom that

937
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,560
you have to pay back a lot each month.

938
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,400
Who buys a house without a mortgage?

939
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,359
But with all your overtime,

940
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:57,759
it's all going to the bank's interest.

941
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,639
That's not ideal.

942
00:40:58,799 --> 00:40:59,639
You should borrow some from Haowen for now.

943
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,199
Haowen.

944
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,239
Haowen, come here.

945
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:01,920
Come.

946
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,679
What's up?

947
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:03,960
Nothing.

948
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,520
My sis...

949
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:08,480
Nothing?

950
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,239
Sis.

951
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,960
I...

952
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:13,600
I'll make you some seafood.

953
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,400
I'll show you my skills.

954
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,520
It's really good.

955
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:16,880
Didn't you just eat?

956
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,639
Still hungry?

957
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,600
I just didn't want to eat too much

958
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,000
at Mom and Dad's home.

959
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,400
Right.

960
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:23,520
You are hungry.

961
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:24,440
Have some more.

962
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,239
Go wash the seafood.

963
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,560
I don't know how.

964
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,960
You don't know how to wash seafood?

965
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
No, I don't.

966
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,159
Come on.

967
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:34,560
What?

968
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,120
I'll show you.

969
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm doing this for your own good.

970
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,480
Why aren't you appreciative?

971
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:42,839
I'll cover the renovation costs.

972
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,319
No need.

973
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,480
Even though we're not

974
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,560
as wealthy as you,

975
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,880
we're not short on money.

976
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,520
Not lacking...

977
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:50,400
With two executives in the house,

978
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,639
you're not short on money.

979
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,560
Right, Brother-in-law?

980
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:53,960
Yes!

981
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,719
Sis.

982
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,359
You seem stressed lately.

983
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,480
Your complexion doesn't look good.

984
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,560
You seem a bit down.

985
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,239
A little bit upset.

986
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,000
Are you going through menopause?

987
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,799
You've mastered the art of conversation.

988
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,440
I just...

989
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,120
I went to the gynecology department

990
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,480
at the provincial hospital yesterday.

991
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,560
I saw a woman

992
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,359
who was only thirty-four

993
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,199
and she's already gone through menopause.

994
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:20,319
Did she tell you that?

995
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,080
Just keep an eye on it.

996
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:24,839
We women need to take care of ourselves.

997
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,480
Here's a beauty salon card for you.

998
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:26,960
No need.

999
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
I don't have time to use it.

1000
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,319
Just take it.

1001
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,639
I'm pregnant now.

1002
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,639
I won't be using it.

1003
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,359
Okay, okay.

1004
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,639
Anything else you can't use?

1005
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,799
You can all give them to me.

1006
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,480
Sis.

1007
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,199
Is there anything wrong?

1008
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,440
You are weird today.

1009
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
You found out?

1010
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:51,440
Brother-in-law.

1011
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:53,359
I'll add more of this ginger paste.

1012
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,239
Garlic paste, okay?

1013
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,880
Later, I'll pour hot oil over it.

1014
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,719
This seafood, fresh seafood,

1015
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,040
shouldn't have any chili.

1016
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,480
Or peppercorns.

1017
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,839
It should be authentic.

1018
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,120
Just like this.

1019
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,359
Brother-in-law.

1020
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,639
Why did you

1021
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,040
invite us today?

1022
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:17,880
Just to get together.

1023
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,520
Meng'an said she missed you.

1024
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,279
Me? No way.

1025
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,639
She missed her sister.

1026
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,000
I missed you, okay?

1027
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:28,880
Okay.

1028
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,839
I'll make sure this seafood

1029
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:30,839
turns out perfectly.

1030
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:31,719
It'll be delicious.

1031
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,080
Did you bring the wine?

1032
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,799
Sure.

1033
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:39,159
Good.
