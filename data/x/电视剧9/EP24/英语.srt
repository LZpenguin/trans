00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,560
Just in Time EP24

3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,000
How long does it take?

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,439
Which street are we in?

5
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,879
Take it easy.

6
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,600
It's just

7
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,840
a traffic jam.

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,439
The GPS is guiding us.

9
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,680
We'll be faster after the jam.

10
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm going crazy over here.

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,919
Well,

12
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,160
I'll adjust your seat back down,

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,719
so, you can lie down.

14
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,079
Nope.

15
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,599
I'm pregnant,

16
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,680
so I may vomit

17
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,239
if I lie down in a shaky car.

18
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,039
Fine.

19
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:18,999
How I envy you.

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,599
Three of you are

21
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
living a happy life.

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,160
No need to.

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,999
I rank the last

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
in my family.

25
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,160
If we raise a dog,

26
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,120
I'll rank the fourth.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Come on, seriously?

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,559
Wow,

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,480
your family's

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,679
all about you, isn't it?

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,959
Li Lin must be treating you

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,120
like a queen, huh?

33
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,360
Look,

34
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,520
how comfortable your life is.

35
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,999
It's not all about that,

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,599
you see.

37
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,080
You gotta give the guy

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,360
some face, right?

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,119
That's correct.

40
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,080
Not doing anything at home,

41
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,280
I must play it low to avoid trouble.

42
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,000
Hit the nail

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,319
on the head.

44
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,280
Why don't I have

45
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,720
your wisdom of life?

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,399
I'm so regrettable!

47
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,080
For what?

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,640
For not treating Wanzhen well?

49
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:15,839
My ex-wife, Wanzhen

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,759
looks after

51
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,080
a whole big family.

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,160
I shouldn't go back

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,080
and pick on her.

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,599
I should learn from you,

55
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,160
don't interfere with

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,599
all the trifles at home.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,679
After getting home,

58
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,759
get along with her harmoniously.

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
Just like you do,

60
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,399
eat humble pie big time.

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,759
I'm not like what you've

62
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,759
just said about me.

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,280
You are.

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,920
Listen to the tone on the phone!

65
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:44,360
Well, it's...

66
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,599
Pretty good.

67
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,119
I'm sure...

68
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:46,920
Forget it!

69
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,239
Stop talking about me.

70
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:48,720
Lower my profile.

71
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,319
Enough!

72
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,440
Let's talk about you.

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,920
I want to know

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,080
what you were thinking.

75
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,559
Divorcing Wanzhen?

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,439
She could give up such a good job

77
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,439
to look after your parents

78
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,119
and children,

79
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,279
do laundry and cook.

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,239
You ought to treasure her a lot.

81
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,439
instead, you despised her!

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Do you know how amazing she is?

83
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,439
In only three months,

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,159
she regains her finance license

85
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,439
and returns to the investment field.

86
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,320
Don't really

87
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,159
look down on her.

88
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,040
Who knows? Maybe one day

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
you'll beg her by kneeling.

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,719
I get it, I get it already.

91
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,839
If one day,

92
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,080
I have no other choice,

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
I'll absolutely kneel,

94
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,239
regardless of the health of my knees.

95
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,239
I'll kneel as hard as I can.

96
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,640
Till I can't take it anymore

97
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,279
Go for it!

98
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,040
Well, at that time,

99
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
I oversimplified the whole situation.

100
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:37,999
My male chauvinism

101
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,959
is kicking in.

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,999
But I was also realistic.

103
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,159
If I worked hard

104
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,679
as well as she did,

105
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,480
with no one

106
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,360
at home,

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,239
who will take charge

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,999
of the family?

109
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,239
We've old and young to care for.

110
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,159
Moreover,

111
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,520
I am a man.

112
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
If my wife is more competitive,

113
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,439
how can I keep my dignity?

114
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,999
I must let her know

115
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
who is the master in the family!

116
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,360
Oh, how vulnerable you are!

117
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,159
Just fearing your wife might surpass you,

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,200
then you hold her back.

119
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,640
Don't point it out!

120
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,439
You're being selfish!

121
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
If you thought like that,

122
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,600
why did you marry Wanzhen?

123
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,839
Wouldn't it perfect

124
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,600
to find an innocent bird?

125
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,839
I thought she was!

126
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:22,679
Look at her tiny face,

127
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:23,320
right?

128
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,999
She had me with her

129
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,239
delicate and clingy appearance.

130
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,040
Who knew that

131
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,559
she would be so strong

132
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,399
after we got together?

133
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,679
You deserve it.

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
You just don't get her.

135
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,880
Yes, I deserve it.

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,920
Otherwise, my marriage wouldn't

137
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,080
have failed temporarily.

138
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:39,640
Temporarily?

139
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,080
Temporarily.

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,719
I'm expecting your reunion.

141
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,399
Be at ease.

142
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,159
You'll see my success.

143
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,679
Giving her a little pressure,

144
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,320
she should erupt like a volcano!

145
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,800
But I admit that I deserve it.

146
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,679
Don't repudiate yourself utterly.

147
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,399
Wanzhen once told me

148
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,719
you were chasing after her

149
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,040
like crazy.

150
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,719
She believed

151
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,799
it was love.

152
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,560
So, you've gained love

153
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,200
from Wanzhen.

154
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
It's only a trick.

155
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,520
Say that again?

156
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,120
No, no, no.

157
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,599
It's... It's love.

158
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,919
Do you know how passionate

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,320
I was then?

160
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:19,159
However,

161
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:21,719
loving is easy,

162
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,760
but getting along is hard.

163
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,440
I now fully understand it.

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,479
Why can't I just

165
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,760
lower my profile?

166
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,039
I'm so stupid!

167
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,039
Why did you mention it again?

168
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,520
Shut up!

169
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,640
The wisdom of life.

170
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
You are the great winner.

171
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,640
Am I?

172
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,320
Now I know why Wanzhen

173
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,399
fell in love with you.

174
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,880
You're honest,

175
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,279
never disguising yourself.

176
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,000
I'd rather be

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,039
an honest bad guy

178
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,120
than a lying

179
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:51,640
hypocrite.

180
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,919
Am I right?

181
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,440
My infallible class monitor.

182
00:06:59,159 --> 00:06:59,919
Maybe.

183
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,359
Here we are.

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,760
Where is it?

185
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:11,479
Oh,

186
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,919
Children's Palace training department.

187
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,120
No, you've got it all wrong.

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm going to the Children's Palace.

189
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,159
Lv,

190
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,159
turn over

191
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,839
to the Palace.

192
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,440
Hello.

193
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,599
Darling.

194
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,039
The driver sent me

195
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,000
to the wrong place.

196
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,159
Where are you?

197
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Don't come.

198
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,200
It's finished.

199
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,159
We are leaving now.

200
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm here.

201
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,159
Where are you?

202
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,000
Mom, where are you?

203
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,359
I'm at the place of your show.

204
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,039
Though I missed your performance,

205
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,479
I must come here

206
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,039
to see your performance venue.

207
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,359
Go home with your father first.

208
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,559
Mom,

209
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,840
the show is particularly for you.

210
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,600
Thanks for your cultivation.

211
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,360
Thank you, my daughter.

212
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Give me a hug.

213
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,799
What a touching scene!

214
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,880
The great pianist and her mother

215
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,039
meet finally!

216
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,480
Don't record it!

217
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,399
Stop recording us!

218
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,079
Come on!

219
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:09,799
You're in tears.

220
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,039
It's the imbalance of hormones.

221
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,199
Stop filming!

222
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,199
Jesus!

223
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,720
Yunjie,

224
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,000
what a good scheme!

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,919
Excellent!

226
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,720
Thanks for all you've done.

227
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,120
Thanks you, dear.

228
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,079
Let's take a selfie.

229
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,760
Come here.

230
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,159
Come on.

231
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,240
Take a photo.

232
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:26,919
Hurry up.

233
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,960
Give one to me.

234
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:29,600
Yes.

235
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,319
It's prepared for you.

236
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,799
One, two, three!

237
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,799
One more shot.

238
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:38,880
Ready?

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,760
One, two, three!

240
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,439
Jing,

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,720
the free-range rooster

242
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
was bought by my cousin

243
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,319
from his neighbor.

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Look at

245
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,720
its claws!

246
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:03,840
See?

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,640
The color.

248
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,960
Got it.

249
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,360
Whether this is a native chicken

250
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,799
or not depends on its claws.

251
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,120
The free-range ones

252
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,199
are much more nutritious

253
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
than rear livestock in pens!

254
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,960
I have another one.

255
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,079
Mrs. Wu asked me to stew it

256
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,960
and send it to Xin.

257
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,399
Yes.

258
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,240
You're doing it right.

259
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,319
Working in

260
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,000
Xu's family,

261
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,399
you must treat

262
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,760
them well,

263
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,559
understand?

264
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,319
When you leave here,

265
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,880
bring two bags of medicine.

266
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
The larger one is for Mr. Xu,

267
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,439
and the other one is for Xin.

268
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,880
Don't worry, Jing.

269
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,079
I won't forget it.

270
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,319
I'll help you kill the chicken now.

271
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,520
I should go back earlier,

272
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,840
because Mrs. Wu doesn't know how to kill.

273
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:56,679
No need.

274
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,880
I'll do it on my own.

275
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,240
Fine. Go back now.

276
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
It's over four o'clock.

277
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
I should stew the chicken

278
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,919
for over one hour.

279
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,279
You can do it?

280
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,720
Of course I can do it.

281
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,840
We've made a deal.

282
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,159
I don't want to kill you,

283
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,720
but I have no choice.

284
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
However,

285
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,880
Your death was meaningful.

286
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,199
You'll make a great contribution

287
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,559
to our whole family.

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,480
I would like to thank you

289
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,880
on behalf of my family!

290
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,240
Ready?

291
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,279
I'm about to start.

292
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,480
I'm coming.

293
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,640
Here goes...

294
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,199
Come on!

295
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:13,880
Hurry up!

296
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,279
Sis,

297
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,319
we're back!

298
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,199
You're back?

299
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:16,840
We're back!

300
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,600
Dinner's ready.

301
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,679
Jing,

302
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
let's eat some meat today.

303
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,919
It's a reward for my mom from my dad

304
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,960
for ranking among the top ten!

305
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,079
What a coincidence!

306
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,399
Your aunt made so many

307
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,199
vegetable dishes!

308
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:27,520
Come here.

309
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,159
Put it on the table.

310
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,640
With a balanced portion,

311
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,279
we can live a long life.

312
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,199
How dare you

313
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,399
buy such greasy food?

314
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,000
Occasionally.

315
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,039
Is that okay?

316
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,399
No way!

317
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,360
Let me show you

318
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,199
how bad

319
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,360
Look at this meat.

320
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,760
It's so tough.

321
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,640
The chicken was fed with growth hormone,

322
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,360
you know?

323
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,600
Besides,

324
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,640
there are too many

325
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,840
trans-fatty acids,

326
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,279
which are so unhealthy!

327
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,000
And how could you treasure such meat?

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,760
What a waste of money!

329
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,720
My sister.

330
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,319
Don't be mad.

331
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,199
We won't eat it.

332
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,000
Can I just eat one piece?

333
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,559
Just one.

334
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,600
No way!

335
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,760
Not a single piece!

336
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,840
You are in the period of

337
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,319
physical development now.

338
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:14,919
you know?

339
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,880
The large amount of hormone

340
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,559
will cause appalling results!

341
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,319
You may become

342
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,760
so fat that you can't

343
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,159
squeeze through the door!

344
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,199
Jing,

345
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,120
I know everything you said.

346
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,840
It's okay to eat it occasionally.

347
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,960
By the way, the trans-fatty acid...

348
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,240
Right.

349
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,199
My grandparents

350
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,159
both sold fried chicken.

351
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,840
I don't think my mom and her sister

352
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,919
are as fat as you said.

353
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,120
Wash your hands.

354
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,000
We'll wash our hands.

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,679
There were not too many additives

356
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,319
in your grandparents' era.

357
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,559
Times have changed.

358
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,679
No matter how,

359
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,799
you can't eat it.

360
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,880
Jing,

361
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,880
it's okay for us not to eat it,

362
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,079
but we need some meat!

363
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,279
All dishes are only vegetables.

364
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,840
Meng'an is pregnant,

365
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,399
and our daughter needs nutrition

366
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,399
for physical growth.

367
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,799
I used to take charge of

368
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,240
what we ate before,

369
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,520
so please make it nutritious

370
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,439
if you want to take charge!

371
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,720
Not nutritious?

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,919
How ungrateful you are!

373
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,039
I'm not pregnant,

374
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,000
and I don't need to grow.

375
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,799
I'll eat it.

376
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,120
No way!

377
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,159
Why?

378
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:13,600
You can't!

379
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,399
Why can't I?

380
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:14,880
You can't!

381
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,360
I ordered you not to!

382
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,039
I must eat it!

383
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:16,559
You can't, either!

384
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,480
Why can't I?

385
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,000
You just can't!

386
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,799
I must eat it!

387
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,159
No way!

388
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:20,559
Darling.

389
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,480
No way!

390
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,079
Calm down.

391
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,600
Stop fighting!

392
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,720
Stop fighting!

393
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,799
I'm not!

394
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,319
I just want to eat some fried chicken!

395
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,720
Is meat all you want?

396
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:32,279
Does it deserve this?

397
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,840
What's the big deal?

398
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,199
This morning,

399
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,039
I asked Lanxiang

400
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,279
to get me

401
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,960
a free-range chicken in the village.

402
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,039
It is being stewed.

403
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
How could you slander me

404
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,279
if I made nutritious soup?

405
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,480
I've got my plan.

406
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,279
You are so picky.

407
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,159
Even eat this kind of meat!

408
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,079
Mom,

409
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,880
I want fried chicken.

410
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:02,960
Forget about it.

411
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,199
The free-range chicken

412
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,799
is also chicken.

413
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,079
Wash your hands.

414
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:10,480
Let's go.

415
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,679
What are you doing?

416
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,399
So yummy!

417
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,720
Yunjie,

418
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,600
both of you and your mom

419
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,919
can get one chicken leg.

420
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,079
Have a chicken wing.

421
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:49,960
I won't.

422
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm a vegan now.

423
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,879
Well, I'll eat it.

424
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:57,720
Meng'an,

425
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,799
how's the flavor?

426
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,279
The soup is so delicious!

427
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,879
Right?

428
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
The meat is

429
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,960
great!

430
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,200
Yes.

431
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
So chewy.

432
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,319
Yummy!

433
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
It'll be better if it's fried.

434
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,960
What are you talking about?

435
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,079
I've told you

436
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,799
it's unhealthy to be fried.

437
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:21,879
The free-range chicken

438
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,520
tastes best if stewed.

439
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,279
Jing,

440
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,119
ignore her.

441
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,359
She's a bit rebellious.

442
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,599
Li Yunjie.

443
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,839
You're way out of line.

444
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,599
What?

445
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,279
Strike.

446
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,639
A full mark!

447
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,160
We'll look through them later.

448
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,879
If you keep it like this,

449
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,559
my dear,

450
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,520
you'll be a scientist

451
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:20,200
very soon.

452
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,879
You're at least an intellectual.

453
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,119
You don't sound like one!

454
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,920
The joke is not funny.

455
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:28,920
Fine.

456
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,680
Yunjie,

457
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,639
let me comb your hair.

458
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,680
For what?

459
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:46,879
It's late at night.

460
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,680
Why are you wearing my hair clip?

461
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,160
Because you look pretty

462
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,200
when you wore it that day.

463
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,240
I want to have a try.

464
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,520
Do you need any favor?

465
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,480
Let me help you.

466
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,400
I want to eat fried chicken.

467
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,400
Or barbecue!

468
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,440
It's... too difficult.

469
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,319
Is it true that we can't eat

470
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,400
any fried chicken or barbecue

471
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
as long as she's here?

472
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:27,799
Don't be sad.

473
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,799
Let's eat outside.

474
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,279
If we eat them

475
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,279
in the cafeteria,

476
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,400
your aunt won't know it.

477
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,119
We can also

478
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,960
go for a walk to disperse the flavor.

479
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:36,879
Right.

480
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
We can also go to the nanny's home

481
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
to eat the fried chicken made by her!

482
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,279
And barbecue!

483
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm getting hungry.

484
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,400
Yunjie,

485
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,279
where is the chocolate I gave you?

486
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,079
You want it?

487
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,200
Chicken legs are yours,

488
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
but I didn't even drink the soup,

489
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,960
or any chicken skin!

490
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:00,960
Where's the chocolate?

491
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,799
Behind the computer.

492
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,279
A good hide!

493
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,359
May I have a bar of it?

494
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,839
Chocolate can't compare to chicken!

495
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,279
How tasty the leg is!

496
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,279
So chewy!

497
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,680
I'll give you a bar.

498
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,200
I know you are the best.

499
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,359
A yellow one?

500
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,879
There are different colors.

501
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,599
Different flavors?

502
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:38,920
Fine.

503
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,279
What else?

504
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a reward for you to have one.

505
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,639
Chickpea!

506
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,720
I want that flavor.

507
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,879
That's enough.

508
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:44,760
Only two bars left.

509
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,119
Well,

510
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,760
we can still buy it.

511
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:47,520
Who will buy it?

512
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,639
I will.

513
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,480
Two boxes.

514
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:51,200
Three boxes.

515
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:52,760
Fine.

516
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,839
Three boxes.

517
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,960
Why can't I tear it open?

518
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,680
Can't compete with chicken.

519
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,079
That's called life!

520
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,559
Better than the chicken?

521
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Yummy.

522
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,720
Stopped vomiting?

523
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,039
Are you still stuck on what just happened?

524
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,200
Or are you still sticking with it?

525
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm gonna stick with it for a bit.

526
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,440
Oh, I see.

527
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,359
Here's the thing.

528
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,920
Under the effective nursing of Jing,

529
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,359
I am now

530
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,879
highly immune to the food,

531
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,760
but I'm still sensitive

532
00:23:59,039 --> 00:23:59,839
to the odor.

533
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,119
For example, today,

534
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,000
I smelled very

535
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,680
strong perfume,

536
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,639
and I vomited.

537
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,440
What kind of perfume?

538
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,799
I don't know.

539
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,119
It smelled so disgusting.

540
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,119
Do you know who sprang

541
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,839
the perfume?

542
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,720
Who is it?

543
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,559
The woman who meddled with

544
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,720
the relation between Yu Hai and Wanzhen.

545
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,240
A mistress?

546
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,480
No.

547
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,279
Yu Hai swore to me that

548
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
nothing happened to them.

549
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
But I didn't trust him.

550
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,440
How could it be possible?

551
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,680
The perfume was spread

552
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,319
all over his car,

553
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,000
and before he talked to me,

554
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,639
he asked the driver to wear earbuds.

555
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,240
Think about it.

556
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,240
If his driver,

557
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,720
accompanying him every day,

558
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
can't be trusted by Yu Hai,

559
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
how can I trust him?

560
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
Who buys it?

561
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:42,200
Well,

562
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,160
you've told me

563
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,359
he asked the driver

564
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,960
to wear the earbuds,

565
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,039
which means nothing happened.

566
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:48,879
Yes.

567
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,200
I noticed men

568
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,760
are so tolerable to other men!

569
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,799
Isn't it way too much?

570
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,799
Talk in a good way.

571
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Speak nicely?

572
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,559
Okay.

573
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,240
Yu Hai...

574
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,440
Don't you think you were

575
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,960
too hard

576
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,559
to Jing?

577
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
I indeed had a bad attitude.

578
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,960
You've seen it all.

579
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
But she was not like that.

580
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,400
She disciplined me,

581
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,119
but in a different way.

582
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,720
How disturbing she is

583
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,119
to erupt like a volcano?

584
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,760
I don't really care,

585
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:33,559
but I'm afraid you'll be disturbed.

586
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,559
It's true that our life

587
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,480
is not as free as before.

588
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,000
Right?

589
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,279
Then what's going on?

590
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,920
What a drastic change!

591
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
How old is Jing?

592
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,279
Fifty-five.

593
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,119
Menopause?

594
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,799
When I searched menopause,

595
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,599
I recalled quite clearly what it said.

596
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
Irritable, depressed,

597
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,559
sweating, and insomnia.

598
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:07,520
She seems to have them all,

599
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,359
doesn't she?

600
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
No wonder.

601
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,039
It must be not easy for her.

602
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,720
We should treat her even better.

603
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,839
Comfort her now and then,

604
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,599
understand?

605
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,200
During menopause,

606
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,520
if she becomes depressed

607
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,480
and don't get better,

608
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
she'll continue to be depressed

609
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,440
for the rest of her life,

610
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,400
you know?

611
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,079
Besides,

612
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,920
throw the fried chicken away

613
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,599
right now.

614
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,839
Jing is a food saver.

615
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,000
Though we're not allowed to eat it,

616
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
she won't throw it away.

617
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,960
She may eat it alone

618
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,639
if all of us get out

619
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:37,639
tomorrow.

620
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,480
You're right.

621
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,319
Okay.

622
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,799
Menopause comes silently

623
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,879
without any signs at all?

624
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,279
Dump it all!

625
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,200
Not a single piece!

626
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,520
Jing.

627
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,400
What are you doing?

628
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,720
Throw it away.

629
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,400
It's not healthy.

630
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,240
Throw it away.

631
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:33,440
No way!

632
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,480
You can't! Give it to me.

633
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,920
It's not worthwhile

634
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,680
to cook lunch for myself,

635
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,200
so it'll be my lunch.

636
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,879
Well, even if you're eating alone,

637
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,039
you can't eat unhealthy food,

638
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,599
right?

639
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,079
Have some good food.

640
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,839
Jing,

641
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:46,920
do you come to my house

642
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
to eat leftovers?

643
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,760
You keep telling us health all day long,

644
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:50,760
right?

645
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,240
Hand-shaking exercise,

646
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
and grain porridge.

647
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,960
It tastes bad,

648
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,160
and it is unhealthy.

649
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,279
Didn't you tell us?

650
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720
The leftover of fried chicken

651
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,879
ruins everything for health.

652
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,839
You are wasting

653
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,559
all the Chinese herbal tonics

654
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,839
you are drinking

655
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,079
every day.

656
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
How can you call yourself a doctor?

657
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,039
Right?

658
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,000
Do I spend your money on health?

659
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,960
Even you are brought up by me!

660
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,799
Don't be angry.

661
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,000
They're asleep. Keep quiet!

662
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,039
Jing,

663
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,200
I'm in my forties.

664
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,839
My wife and daughter are at home,

665
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,359
so I'll take charge of the chores

666
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,559
at home.

667
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,160
Don't you worry about it.

668
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm grateful for

669
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,960
what you did.

670
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,920
But...

671
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,079
Well...

672
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,480
Don't make me embarrassed,

673
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,200
will you?

674
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,799
How did I make you embarrassed?

675
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,440
Aren't you making me feel silly?

676
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,319
Who's the eldest in our family?

677
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,039
How dare you

678
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,240
talk to me like that?

679
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,400
What an ingrate!

680
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
So heartless!

681
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Jesus!

682
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,039
Jing,

683
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,559
don't be mad at me.

684
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,720
I don't want you to eat leftover

685
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,160
because I care about your health,

686
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,079
right?

687
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:32,879
Well...

688
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,319
I have only one sister.

689
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,760
What if your health deteriorates

690
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,079
for taking care of us,

691
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,119
I'd feel extremely

692
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,520
sorry about that.

693
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,879
Fine.

694
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,839
My brother-in-law

695
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,279
hasn't called you recently.

696
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,520
Jing,

697
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,799
you see,

698
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,079
Meng'an's condition is stable now,

699
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,559
and our whole family

700
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,680
has been getting even better

701
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,760
under your management and

702
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,799
meticulous care.

703
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,639
and your treatment methods

704
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,160
have been grasped by me,

705
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,680
so don't worry.

706
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,680
I mean,

707
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,480
I think it's time for you

708
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,440
to go back.

709
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,799
After all, Mr Ouyang is alone

710
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,200
back home,

711
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,119
and I feel worried about him.

712
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,279
By the way,

713
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,639
living separately

714
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,359
for a long time,

715
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:28,240
the couple may face a marriage crisis.

716
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,879
We're becoming old.

717
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:32,920
Nothing much can go wrong.

718
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,400
Well, that's not the right way to put it.

719
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:36,680
Many problems emerge

720
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,359
in one's fifties or even sixties.

721
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,119
Piss off!

722
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,760
You haven't said a single proper word.

723
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,240
I said you were an ingrate,

724
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,599
and you are.

725
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,200
Piss off!

726
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,279
I wish you well.

727
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,639
I don't want to see you anymore!

728
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,200
Well...

729
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,639
Piss off!

730
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,359
Where were you?

731
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,559
What took you so long?

732
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,119
Isn't it mere garbage?

733
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,440
I tried to comfort Jing.

734
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,720
Did you manage it?

735
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,200
I was kicked out of her room.

736
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,799
How could that happen?

737
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,760
How did you comfort her?

738
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,079
How?

739
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,319
Just like what I did to you.

740
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,319
Like you did to me?

741
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,359
Comforting me for so many years,

742
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,240
I've never kicked you out

743
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,079
of the room.

744
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,359
Really.

745
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:03,039
It's the same.

746
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
I kept smiling,

747
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,160
with a kind expression,

748
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,119
and gently told her

749
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,000
not to be mad,

750
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,920
and visit Ouyang if available.

751
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
What did you say?

752
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,680
Now you see the problem.

753
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,879
What did I tell you?

754
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,000
Menopause.

755
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
Irritable, and depressed.

756
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,279
Comfort her in the right way!

757
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,760
She was so mad,

758
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,079
but you told her to leave.

759
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,760
Is that...

760
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,720
a right way to comfort her?

761
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,440
I'd rather reckon it

762
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,680
as adding fuel to flames!

763
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,639
If I were her,

764
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,240
I would also kick you out.

765
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,639
Sorry,

766
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:46,799
it's my fault.

767
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,799
I'll go again.

768
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,359
Forget it.

769
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,119
Don't go.

770
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,520
There's no use anymore.

771
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,760
Go to bed.

772
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,960
I'll comfort her tomorrow.

773
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,000
How couldn't you deal with it?

774
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,079
How useless you are!

775
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:01,319
It's easy to comfort one's sister.

776
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,319
I...

777
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,200
Go to bed.

778
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Give me some space!

779
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,799
So disappointed in you!

780
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,639
Jing?

781
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,240
Lin,

782
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,200
where is Jing?

783
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,879
Jing sent me a message

784
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,119
that she's going back.

785
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,400
She missed her husband.

786
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,520
Do you know how serious

787
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,520
menopause is now?

788
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,200
Fetch me my phone.

789
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,879
Hello, Meng'an.

790
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,200
Hello, Jing.

791
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,480
Where are you?

792
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,400
I'm at the inter-city bus station.

793
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,279
I miss my husband,

794
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
so I'll visit him.

795
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,160
Why didn't you tell me

796
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,520
before leaving?

797
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll give you a ride.

798
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,200
No need.

799
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,160
I couldn't fall asleep,

800
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,200
so I got up early.

801
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,279
When are you coming back?

802
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,799
During these days,

803
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,520
I've noticed

804
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,319
that you two

805
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:05,240
sincerely want the baby.

806
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,279
I'm here to give you a hand,

807
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,920
not to meddle with your life.

808
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:10,720
How's that?

809
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,920
When you're delivering the baby,

810
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,400
I'll come back to help, okay?

811
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,160
Okay.

812
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,119
Have a good rest.

813
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
If I miss you,

814
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
please come back.

815
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,960
Of course.

816
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,960
Okay.

817
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:38,200
Is she leaving?

818
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,000
Is it because I wanted fried chicken?

819
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,799
It's none of your business.

820
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,319
Can I take off the board

821
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:51,480
in my bedroom?

822
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:52,639
Don't you do that!

823
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:53,920
Hang it right there.

824
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,800
It's your auntie's expectation!

825
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,400
Why are you mad at her?

826
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,800
Isn't it your wish

827
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,880
that she goes back?

828
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,759
Now, she's back

829
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,320
eventually.

830
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,719
Hello,

831
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,119
Song.

832
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,759
I was about to

833
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:03,079
call you.

834
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,079
How's that?

835
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,759
How's everything going?

836
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:52,800
Hello.

837
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,639
Hello.

838
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,520
May I ask

839
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,360
how much money I can earn

840
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,199
for a month

841
00:37:59,199 --> 00:37:59,800
if I work here

842
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,159
with a matron certificate?

843
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,759
It depends on the level

844
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:03,559
of you.

845
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:06,960
Okay. Thanks.

846
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,520
It doesn't matter.

847
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,079
She's laughing

848
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:18,920
so happily!

849
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,639
Lanxiang is here.

850
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,079
This is chicken soup

851
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,320
made by Mrs. Wu for Xin.

852
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,880
Xin is such a fussy eater.

853
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,400
She loves the soup made by Mom.

854
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,320
Thank you so much

855
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,719
for running back and forth.

856
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,800
It's my duty.

857
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,119
Lanxiang, come here.

858
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,360
This is for our gratitude.

859
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:35,880
No,

860
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,639
I can't take it.

861
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,719
Meng'an has given hers.

862
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,840
That's for looking after dad.

863
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,800
It's ours.

864
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,159
Take it.

865
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,639
For our gratitude.

866
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,000
Thank you, Mr. Jia.

867
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,759
Not at all.

868
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:46,920
Where is Xin?

869
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,400
She went to see a doctor.

870
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,480
See a doctor?

871
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,960
She's fine.

872
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
A psychology doctor.

873
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,920
Is the company functioning well?

874
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,159
Has the financial product been cashed?

875
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,159
It's cashed partly,

876
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,079
but the rest has not.

877
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,480
It's promised

878
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,079
to be cashed in two years.

879
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,159
Do you think they'll cash it?

880
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,280
Can he give me the money

881
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,520
I borrowed from my relatives?

882
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,719
It's such a big real estate company,

883
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
so it won't go bankrupt easily.

884
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,719
You can believe in the policy

885
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,079
and the development of the industry.

886
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,000
I wish I had taken your advice.

887
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,920
Here you are.

888
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,880
The list of your clients?

889
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,960
Yes. I've informed them all.

890
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
The client resources

891
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,000
are left to you.

892
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,559
Afterward, no matter

893
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,880
which company you are in,

894
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,119
as long as you do a sales job,

895
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,199
you can use it.

896
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:47,800
Keep those clients

897
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,119
as hard as you can.

898
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,119
Wanzhen,

899
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,759
I can't thank you more.

900
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,079
I used to be bad to you,

901
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,280
because I felt you were disguising.

902
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,480
I behaved like a jerk!

903
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,079
But you are helping me

904
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,159
in my hardest time

905
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,000
by giving me your clients!

906
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,719
Thank you, Wanzhen.

907
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,320
Not at all, Feifei.

908
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,280
You can learn from the failure.

909
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,199
As a real estate salesperson,

910
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:10,840
you can't be professional enough

911
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,119
to do a professional job.

912
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,280
Keep your clients.

913
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,480
Thank you.

914
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,719
It's so easy to be a good man!

915
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,520
Men don't need to deliver babies,

916
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,320
but a little bit of care

917
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,400
can gain them great praise.

918
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,719
As for women,

919
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,520
we take the risk

920
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,800
of losing lives to deliver babies,

921
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,119
but are regarded as

922
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,559
unqualified moms by others.

923
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,639
Honey,

924
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,480
do you really

925
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,039
believe in that?

926
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,360
I know that

927
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,239
my wife is the best mom.

928
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,079
Am I right, darling?

929
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,039
Let me tell you

930
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,480
why they praise me.

931
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,920
It's because we spent a lot of money.

932
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,400
Xin,

933
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,639
when we left the hospital

934
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,800
the time when our baby was one month old,

935
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,320
you had not recovered yet.

936
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,960
Now it's almost two months, right?

937
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,759
I'd like to invite our parents

938
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,520
and give her a queen party!

939
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,239
Really?

940
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,440
I'll give Little Watermelon

941
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,400
a full-month party.

942
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,159
What do you think?

943
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,400
Not good.

944
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,559
I don't expect the party.

945
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm dressed in pajamas every day.

946
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,800
So ugly!

947
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,759
That's easy.

948
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:23,759
I'll invite

949
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:25,039
the styling team

950
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,119
for my company's advertisement.

951
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,920
I'll get you

952
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,159
a floor-length gown as a queen,

953
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,320
and a big crown on your head.

954
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,360
I'll be your servant

955
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,280
by holding your right hand.

956
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,159
Dad will be the king,

957
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,400
while Mom will be the queen.

958
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,599
Meng'an can be the princess,

959
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,599
Li Lin the Imperial son-in-law,

960
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,360
Yunjie a little princess,

961
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:39,800
and Xiongxiong a little prince.

962
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,480
How's that?

963
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,559
Not good.

964
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:44,199
What crap are you talking about?

965
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,880
A floor-length gown?

966
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
A queen?

967
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,679
A big crown?

968
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,679
An Imperial son-in-law?

969
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,400
And a little princess?

970
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,759
Full of crap!

971
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:51,960
Darling,

972
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,639
it's fashionable to

973
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,320
hold a mix-and-match party.

974
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,400
You're a mix-and-match product!

975
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,880
They are our families.

976
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,079
Eating a cake

977
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,119
would be enough.

978
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,079
Is it a yes?

979
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,960
Do it.

980
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,360
Yes, Madam.

981
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,960
I'll go first.

982
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,119
The queen party!

983
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,280
Sir,

984
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,759
we offer

985
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,079
the basic party package.

986
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,480
If you want to level it up,

987
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,239
you can refer to

988
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,119
the price list.

989
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,520
Level it up.

990
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,199
I'll buy

991
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,480
Supreme Deluxe Party Package!

992
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,320
Yes, Sir.

993
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,880
You're so good to your wife!

994
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
What a good man!

995
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,920
Of course. She deserves it.

996
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,199
I admire your relationship.

997
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,079
Then, let me help you

998
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:38,920
order this package.

999
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,440
Okay.

1000
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,520
Sorry.

1001
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,440
Is there any package

1002
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,679
to be more deluxe?
