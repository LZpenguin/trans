1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,480
Just in Time EP20

3
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,079
I'm not...

4
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:52,839
Mom.

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,160
There you are.

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,479
And you are?

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,359
Meng'an's elder sister.

8
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
We met at the wedding.

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,680
Li Jing.

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,359
Yeah.

11
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,160
He has a very good memory.

12
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,359
The people he met

13
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,479
never forget.

14
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,320
Yeah.

15
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Have a seat.

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,040
Sit here.

17
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,439
Please.

18
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:12,919
Just

19
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,880
a gift.

20
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,719
Thank you.

21
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,159
Thank you.

22
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,879
Mengxin.

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,920
I came to see you.

24
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,039
It's hard for you.

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,999
You suffered.

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,800
You are

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,159
very fair.

28
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,520
But you're pale now.

29
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,439
Meng'an told me about caesarean section.

30
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,159
So I came to see you right away.

31
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,080
Are you still in pain?

32
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,879
Yeah.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,240
I can't even sleep.

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,319
Have a good Postpartum Confinement.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,559
Take good care of yourself.

36
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,719
Thank you.

37
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,960
En...

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,559
I bought a pair of

39
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,480
gold bracelets for our baby.

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Put it on her

41
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
when she is older.

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,599
Just come.

43
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,920
You don't have to buy gifts.

44
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,999
Thank you.

45
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,159
What about the kid?

46
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,439
In that thermostat.

47
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,039
Is she okay?

48
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,400
Just observe her.

49
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,279
Don't

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,200
worry about her.

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,719
She is full of vitality.

52
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,960
Just you.

53
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,319
Look.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,680
Oh, my god.

55
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,520
Your thin arms.

56
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,719
You are too thin.

57
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,599
I'm telling you,

58
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,319
surgery will weaken

59
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,159
a woman.

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,360
Mengxin.

61
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
See what she means?

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,960
Weaken you.

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,200
So you should eat and drink enough

64
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
to recover.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,080
Yeah.

66
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,759
Well.

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,200
I'll ask my husband

68
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,159
to give you a prescription

69
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,759
for tonifying blood and qi.

70
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,999
Once you

71
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,240
recover,

72
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,879
your milk

73
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:06,839
and meridians

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,439
will get better.

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,360
That's good

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,599
for you

77
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,999
and your child.

78
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,599
Right?

79
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,839
Well.

80
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:14,279
Mom.

81
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,400
This bracelet she bought

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,920
must be very good.

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,839
Let's go and have a look.

84
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:19,680
You go ahead.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,999
Did she give milk?

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,839
No.

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,079
That's no good.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,920
She has to eat and drink more.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
Pig trotter soup.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,999
Crucian carp soup. Millet porridge.

91
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,040
You have to drink more.

92
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,600
Write a prescription.

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,959
I'll make it for her.

94
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,559
Jing.

95
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,519
We decided not to

96
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,639
breastfeed our child this time.

97
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,199
That's bad for Mengxin.

98
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,199
The nutrition

99
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,759
of milk powder

100
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,120
is particularly balanced.

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,840
You are ignorant.

102
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,360
Why doesn't she breastfeed?

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,240
She has just given birth now.

104
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,199
She is in the golden lactation period.

105
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,759
The child must eat breast milk.

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
That will make her

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,519
smarter

108
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,519
and healthier.

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
She won't get sick easily

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,280
before she is three years old.

111
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,559
Now she

112
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,319
suffers,

113
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,720
but it's good for the child.

114
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,759
Right?

115
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,559
Xiongxiong

116
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,480
ate breast milk, right?

117
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,160
Yeah.

118
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,319
Until he was one year old.

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,439
Yeah.

120
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,439
The second child must also breastfeed.

121
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,360
It is good for Mengxin.

122
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,079
Yeah.

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Well.

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,600
I'll

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,999
examine her.

126
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,280
I have studied massage.

127
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,399
I know

128
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,559
meridian dredging.

129
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,600
Don't worry.

130
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,399
I'll do it.

131
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,160
Don't worry.

132
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,240
Don't worry.

133
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,439
Mengxin.

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,399
What are you doing?

135
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,399
That's OK.

136
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,840
I'll

137
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,920
clear your meridians.

138
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Don't touch me.

139
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,800
Jing.

140
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,319
Get out.

141
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:38,879
Jing.

142
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,559
Get out.

143
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,240
Jing. Let's go out.

144
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,559
Well.

145
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,759
Middle-aged people should

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,920
learn to be happy with themselves.

147
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Take a back seat,

148
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,999
but

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,999
you can still

150
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:22,480
inspire yourself.

151
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,439
You can

152
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,559
make a comeback

153
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,480
after maternity leave.

154
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,399
For example,

155
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,720
a housewife

156
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,319
named Chen Wanzhen

157
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,800
can

158
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
start

159
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
from scratch

160
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,800
after eight years.

161
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,079
As a

162
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,399
working woman for twenty years,

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
you

164
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,720
definitely can.

165
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,600
No, no, no.

166
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
Not quite the same.

167
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,120
Why?

168
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,600
You dislike me?

169
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,280
I didn't charge you for giving you

170
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,319
a psychological massage.

171
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,600
You should learn from me.

172
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,720
Do you know what books

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I have read recently?

174
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,800
Finance.

175
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,319
I will retake my qualification license.

176
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
I want to go back to my old job.

177
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,199
Your execution ability is very strong.

178
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,639
Sure.

179
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,759
Here I am.

180
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,439
Who is it?

181
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,559
Ms. Chen.

182
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,600
Hello, Dr. Yu.

183
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,280
The hospital

184
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
gave us fruit.

185
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,800
Too much.

186
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,519
I can't finish it alone.

187
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,120
I brought you a box of fruit.

188
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,240
No need, I have it.

189
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:42,879
It's okay.

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,319
Sure.

191
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you.

192
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,879
There is

193
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,680
just no fruit.

194
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,800
Nonsense.

195
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,120
No fruit can be squeezed.

196
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,559
Take it to juice.

197
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,399
Yeah.

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,120
Ms. Chen.

199
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,959
Have you been exercising recently?

200
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,639
I have no time.

201
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm running recently.

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,399
So I want to invite you.

203
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,280
You have hypoglycemia,

204
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,319
so you'd better exercise more.

205
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,959
That's good for your health.

206
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,559
Thank you.

207
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,319
Why don't you go running?

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,840
Let's go together.

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,079
I can't.

210
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,079
I'm leaving soon.

211
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,999
Don't go.

212
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,319
You haven't squeezed the juice yet.

213
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,920
You must be her neighbor.

214
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
She talks about you a lot.

215
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,079
I didn't.

216
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,280
Please come in.

217
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,280
No need.

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,999
I will go running.

219
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:33,519
Well.

220
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,559
Thank you, Dr. Yu.

221
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:34,999
Goodbye.

222
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,079
Let's have dinner another day.

223
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:36,439
OK.

224
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,040
Well.

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,159
What a nice guy.

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,240
Stop it.

227
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,080
Invite him to dinner?

228
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,759
You scared him away.

229
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,560
No.

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,960
I call it being polite.

231
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,560
He has high emotional intelligence.

232
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,720
Don't gossip

233
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,600
with me.

234
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,679
Why not?

235
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,919
It works.

236
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,560
You just gave me

237
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,799
a psychological massage.

238
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,679
But it didn't work.

239
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,600
I feel comfortable

240
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,840
when he comes.

241
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,879
I am very happy now.

242
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,519
Let's change the subject.

243
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,999
What?

244
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,399
Say something serious.

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,360
Say something serious.

246
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:10,999
OK.

247
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,759
I think

248
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
the profession of doctor

249
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,799
is good.

250
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,120
He is

251
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,320
good-looking.

252
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,679
He should have

253
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,399
some life experience in his thirties.

254
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,639
Before, you said that

255
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,440
he was kind to children.

256
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,399
How is he?

257
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,999
Is he reliable?

258
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,600
Stop it.

259
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,999
Far from.

260
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,679
Don't think too much.

261
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,120
I didn't. It's obvious.

262
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,159
En...

263
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,560
What do you mean, far from?

264
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,720
With whom?

265
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,799
Yu Hai?

266
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
Forget it.

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,960
You're going to remarry him?

268
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
No.

269
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,480
You...

270
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,159
Don't look at me like that, okay?

271
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,919
I really didn't.

272
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,600
But you are happy now.

273
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,200
I...

274
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,080
I finally got divorced.

275
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,999
I want to enjoy

276
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,600
my wonderful time alone now.

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Is this not good?

278
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,120
No.

279
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,999
What a pity.

280
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:00,440
En...

281
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,560
What a pity?

282
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,960
He's just a neighbor.

283
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,960
Get to know each other better.

284
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,720
Turn him into...

285
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,360
Well.

286
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,720
Squeeze juice for you.

287
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,600
Dispel fire for you.

288
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,519
Shut your mouth.

289
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,440
Don't.

290
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,600
He's good.

291
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
You go ahead.

292
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,080
I'm not divorced.

293
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,279
She is so cute.

294
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,200
I was moved

295
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,840
by her.

296
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
I

297
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,999
hope Meng'an

298
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,240
has a child.

299
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,720
Don't worry.

300
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,519
She is the elder sister.

301
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,159
Mengxin

302
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,720
has a big temper now.

303
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,799
I can't stand her.

304
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Everyone is willful in Confinement.

305
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
We must understand her.

306
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,720
Auntie.

307
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,159
You have worked hard.

308
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,480
But for the sake of children,

309
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
we must be patient.

310
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:56,679
Yeah.

311
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,960
Prescription for milking.

312
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,639
Rest assured.

313
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,560
I'll get it for you.

314
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
I mean,

315
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
when Mengxin

316
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,279
is in a better mood,

317
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,919
you advise her.

318
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,679
Yeah.

319
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,480
Be sure to let her breastfeed.

320
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,600
That's better.

321
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,679
Yeah.

322
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,840
We didn't have

323
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,399
milk powder before.

324
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,200
We all breastfeed.

325
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,919
Young people nowadays are all delicate.

326
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,999
Dr. Li.

327
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,600
The wound of Xu Mengxin

328
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,279
in Room 1201 is cracked.

329
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,399
Please come as soon as possible.

330
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,279
Mr. Li.

331
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
Please have a look.

332
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,480
OK.

333
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,679
Hello.

334
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,679
What do you want to eat tonight?

335
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,560
I'll cook for you.

336
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,799
No need.

337
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,879
Get ready-made ones.

338
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,799
Meng'an may not come back

339
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,120
for dinner tonight.

340
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,039
She may have to

341
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,279
go to the hospital.

342
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,720
Which hospital?

343
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,639
Me?

344
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,639
I visited your

345
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,840
father-in-law

346
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,999
and sister-in-law.

347
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,679
We have to be polite.

348
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
You went to visit Mengxin?

349
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,240
Yeah.

350
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,159
She gave birth to a baby.

351
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
I have to go.

352
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,639
I'm telling you,

353
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,879
she

354
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,679
has a big temper.

355
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,840
She's tough.

356
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,799
You don't have to go.

357
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,240
You are not

358
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,399
that close to her.

359
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,560
I didn't even go.

360
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,720
You are a man.

361
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,919
You needn't go.

362
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,080
She is

363
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,120
Meng'an's sister.

364
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,799
Since I'm here,

365
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,360
I must be polite.

366
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:29,960
Right?

367
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,039
Well.

368
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,360
I bought a pair of

369
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,440
gold bracelets for the child.

370
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,919
I tell you,

371
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
your brother-in-law

372
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,679
and his mother

373
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,600
are very polite.

374
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,879
How's Mengxin?

375
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,080
The wound

376
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,840
of her caesarean section

377
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,679
doesn't seem to be healing very well.

378
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,879
There is

379
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,999
something wrong with it today.

380
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,919
No big problem.

381
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,399
Jing.

382
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,720
Do you have anything to do

383
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,600
with it?

384
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:00,240
Nonsense.

385
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,919
It has nothing to do with me.

386
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,960
I just care about her.

387
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,279
All right, I got to go.

388
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,720
The doctor said

389
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,360
the split wound was not serious.

390
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,759
But the patient has a scar diathesis.

391
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,440
So for the next

392
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,320
four to six hours,

393
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
she must not move

394
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,799
to let the wound heal slowly.

395
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,560
OK.

396
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,240
Sure.

397
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,919
OK.

398
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,759
Thank you.

399
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,840
Goodbye.

400
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,600
Mengxin.

401
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,320
Honey.

402
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,999
Baby.

403
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,320
Don't talk.

404
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,519
Mengxin.

405
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,600
It's my fault.

406
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,440
It's all my fault.

407
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,279
I want to

408
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,159
suffer for you.

409
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,279
I'm really sorry about you.

410
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:15,919
I'm sorry.

411
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,159
Honey. Honey. Honey.

412
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,080
Honey.

413
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,720
From now on,

414
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,879
I won't let anyone in.

415
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,159
I'll let them all go out

416
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,320
and leave you alone.

417
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,679
All.

418
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,080
Except mom.

419
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah.

420
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,600
Except mom.

421
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:33,960
My mom.

422
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,039
Yeah.

423
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,519
Your mother.

424
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,679
Mengxin.

425
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,320
I will stand guard at the door

426
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,240
and not let anyone in.

427
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,879
How about elder sister?

428
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,279
She must be let go.

429
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,159
I won't let her in.

430
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,639
Honey.

431
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,720
Sleep well.

432
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,720
Just stop, okay?

433
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,360
Don't rush me.

434
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,039
My wife has just had surgery.

435
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,440
Don't keep

436
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,560
pushing me.

437
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,120
Can't so many of you

438
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,600
solve this little thing?

439
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,720
There you are.

440
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,080
Haowen.

441
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,679
How's Mengxin?

442
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,840
She's asleep.

443
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
What did the doctor say?

444
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,600
Her wound is cracked

445
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,720
and she needs rest.

446
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,799
Has my elder sister been here?

447
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,039
Yeah.

448
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,279
She came to see Mengxin

449
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,080
and bought

450
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,519
a pair of gold bracelets for the child.

451
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,560
Does the wound

452
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,879
have anything to do with her?

453
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,159
She didn't mean to.

454
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,080
Sorry. Haowen.

455
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,360
Mengxin suffered.

456
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,600
Sorry to bother you.

457
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,840
In fact,

458
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,159
she is quite good.

459
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,600
But she just

460
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,679
likes

461
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,600
living in

462
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,840
her own world.

463
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
She took care of me

464
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,399
when I was in Postpartum Confinement.

465
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,759
So I can understand you.

466
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,159
It's hard to say, you know.

467
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,120
Meng'an.

468
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,480
I really feel it.

469
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,919
Be patient.

470
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,679
Everything will pass.

471
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:19,919
Meng'an.

472
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,159
En...

473
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
The wound of Mengxin is cracked.

474
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,240
So she is very upset

475
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,679
and doesn't want to see anyone.

476
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,039
Even me?

477
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,879
She dare not.

478
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,560
She is really asleep.

479
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,360
Well.

480
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,320
Then I won't go in.

481
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,480
What is important now

482
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,999
is to ensure her physical

483
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:42,999
and mental pleasure.

484
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,320
As long as she is happy,

485
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,600
we will be relieved.

486
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,919
Yeah.

487
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Mengxin suffered this time.

488
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,560
I feel terrible.

489
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,399
She was wheeled from

490
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,600
the delivery room to the operating room.

491
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
She suffered too much.

492
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,080
I wish I could

493
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
bear all this for her.

494
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,519
You are hating me.

495
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,200
How dare I?

496
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,720
You are right.

497
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,240
We need to keep her and baby safe.

498
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,360
Well.

499
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,679
Take care of Mengxin.

500
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,480
I will go back.

501
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:11,600
Go back?

502
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,520
Go back.

503
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:13,879
See you, Meng'an.

504
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:14,560
Call me if you need anything.

505
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,239
Well.

506
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,760
Our sister was here. I kicked her out

507
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,399
and wouldn't let her in.

508
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,199
Let you...

509
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:26,560
Really?

510
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,800
Meng'an.

511
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,120
Good for you.

512
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
I'm sorry.

513
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,919
I was wrong.

514
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,439
Go and reflect.

515
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,360
OK.

516
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,239
I'll watch at the door.

517
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,840
Honey.

518
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,800
I won't let anyone

519
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,320
in again.

520
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,639
Get out, both of you.

521
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,159
You first.

522
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,159
OK.

523
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,439
You don't want to see me?

524
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,040
Are you still angry?

525
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,879
No gifts?

526
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
I came as soon as

527
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,959
I heard

528
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,840
your wound had split.

529
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,159
So I didn't have time to buy it.

530
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,080
Your elder sister knows

531
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
to bring gold bracelets.

532
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,280
I'll buy it for you now.

533
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:51,439
OK.

534
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,959
Don't come back.

535
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,879
Mengxin.

536
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,719
Don't be angry.

537
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,199
Your brother-in-law and I

538
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,280
didn't know she was coming.

539
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,399
But once we know,

540
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:08,080
we can't let her come by herself.

541
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,679
You haven't seen each other

542
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,600
for a long time.

543
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,639
The last time was

544
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,840
when I was in Postpartum Confinement.

545
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,399
If she is coming,

546
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,520
we will come with her.

547
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,399
I didn't expect her

548
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,719
to be so enthusiastic.

549
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,280
And

550
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,399
you know

551
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,959
she's not a bad person.

552
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm sure

553
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,239
she didn't know

554
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,719
this would happen.

555
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,479
But if she knows,

556
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,080
she can't be like this.

557
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,919
Right?

558
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I'm what?

559
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,639
It's cracked.

560
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,399
What?

561
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,760
Wound.

562
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,399
Because of what?

563
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:42,919
Caesarean section.

564
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,080
Who decided?

565
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,719
Doctor.

566
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,479
Who signed it?

567
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,080
Jia Haowen.

568
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
Who forced him?

569
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,399
You mean

570
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,800
me?

571
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:53,439
Get out.

572
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,479
I don't want to see you.

573
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,760
Don't cry.

574
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,360
Don't touch me.

575
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:04,560
No.

576
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,560
Take it easy.

577
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,879
Take it easy.

578
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,439
Look.

579
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,439
A foregone conclusion.

580
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,120
I mean,

581
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,760
if the doctor can

582
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,719
give you a side cut,

583
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,080
he won't...

584
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,520
Get out.

585
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,800
I...

586
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,600
Well.

587
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,639
I'll go.

588
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,040
I'll go.

589
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,919
Don't cry.

590
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,040
En...

591
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,639
If you are in a bad mood,

592
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,560
you can importune.

593
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,719
Do as you please.

594
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,399
Anyway...

595
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,040
Importune?

596
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,320
No. No.

597
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:38,800
They don't understand you.

598
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,760
Importune?

599
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,560
No. No.

600
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,959
Absolutely not.

601
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,959
I believe you.

602
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:43,679
I am in pain.

603
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,479
In pain.

604
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,639
I know.

605
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,040
Who made me hurt?

606
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,919
Get out.

607
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:51,800
Get out.

608
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,120
I don't want to see you.

609
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,679
I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

610
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,159
Don't come here again.

611
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,520
Because of the wound?

612
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,879
Not enough, right?

613
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,959
No. No.

614
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:03,840
No.

615
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

616
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,239
Call me

617
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:07,959
if you need anything.

618
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:08,479
Get out.

619
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,719
Well.

620
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,800
Meng'an.

621
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,360
Why did you come out so soon?

622
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,439
I'd like to stay longer.

623
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,040
Do you think it's wrong for me

624
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,879
to let her have a caesarean section?

625
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,879
No. You are right.

626
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Did I make you sign it?

627
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,080
With your knowledge of her,

628
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,919
how long will she forgive me?

629
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,080
It depends on her mood.

630
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,399
Last time she knew she was pregnant,

631
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,520
she didn't talk to me for three months.

632
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,199
So it will take

633
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,320
half a year this time anyway.

634
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,439
Haowen.

635
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,719
I'm counting on you.

636
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Come on.

637
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,080
Well.

638
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,360
Come on.

639
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,679
Come on.

640
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:05,639
Be careful.

641
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,320
Good.

642
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,080
I want to play on the swing.

643
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,760
Together.

644
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,679
Come on. One, two, three.

645
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,679
Come on. One, two, three.

646
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,719
Zhenzhen. What are you doing?

647
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,800
We are playing Frisbee.

648
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,120
Good.

649
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,399
Where's your sister?

650
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,919
Come on.

651
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:28,399
Dad.

652
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,800
Dad. Where are you?

653
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,879
I just got back from a business trip.

654
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,239
Look.

655
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,280
I'm still in the car.

656
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
I miss you guys.

657
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,439
So I want to see you now.

658
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,760
Dad, I miss you, too.

659
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,840
I'm going to play.

660
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,080
Dad, I'm telling you,

661
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,919
she can play Frisbee

662
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,919
really well.

663
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:47,840
High and far.

664
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,719
I can't catch it.

665
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,479
Look.

666
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,760
Dad, I want to play Frisbee.

667
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,919
I'll hang up.

668
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:56,760
OK.

669
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,919
Be safe.

670
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm telling you,

671
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,919
the edge of Frisbee

672
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,399
is particularly hard.

673
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,199
Watch your head.

674
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,560
Don't just

675
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,600
look at the sky

676
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,479
to catch it.

677
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,600
Watch your step.

678
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,320
Don't trip.

679
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,919
Watch

680
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:10,080
yourself.

681
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,760
Okay, bye, dad.

682
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:12,479
Well.

683
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:12,959
Well.

684
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,479
Have fun.

685
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,080
Have fun.

686
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,000
Aunt, let's have dinner.

687
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,719
I'm hungry.

688
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,120
Right away.

689
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,399
What to cook?

690
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,439
You will know in a moment.

691
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:40,479
Dad.

692
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,320
What's the matter?

693
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,560
What's the matter?

694
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
The sharpness of a sword is honed...

695
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,719
The sharpness of a sword is honed...

696
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,600
The fragrance of plum blossoms...

697
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,239
I did it

698
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,439
just to make you study hard

699
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,159
and get into a key high school.

700
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,199
Come on.

701
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,959
Dinner will be served soon.

702
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,360
Dad.

703
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,120
When will she leave?

704
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,479
In fact, it doesn't

705
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,040
affect your daily life.

706
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,320
Dad.

707
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,520
Do your homework.

708
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,840
Today I talk about four categories.

709
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,520
I've been investigating

710
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,719
the liabilities of a real estate company

711
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,760
recently.

712
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:27,560
Look.

713
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,360
Here are some information

714
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,280
I have collected.

715
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,719
Some public

716
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,600
data.

717
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
Where can I

718
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:35,600
collect more

719
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
comprehensive information?

720
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,159
Some are hidden.

721
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,760
You can know

722
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,080
the source of debt,

723
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:43,760
the amount of bank financing

724
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,560
and other financing

725
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,719
from the structure of debt.

726
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,959
They can all

727
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,120
be retrieved

728
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,840
and consulted

729
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,520
in these projects.

730
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,679
That will give you a more accurate

731
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,959
understanding of this company.

732
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,840
Got it. Thank you.

733
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,360
You're welcome.

734
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,800
Please look at

735
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,239
these data for me.

736
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,439
Come on. One more.

737
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,600
How's it going?

738
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,679
Good.

739
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,679
Go.

740
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,199
Catch it.

741
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,239
Throw it back.

742
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,560
Your dad's back.

743
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:41,280
Dad.

744
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,760
Wanwan. Zhenzhen.

745
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,800
I miss you guys.

746
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,120
Kiss you.

747
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,840
Look.

748
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:52,959
Gifts for you.

749
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,800
A new skirt for each of you.

750
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,919
A father rabbit.

751
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,800
A mother rabbit.

752
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,320
Who wants?

753
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,000
I want mother rabbit.

754
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,159
Mother rabbit.

755
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,199
Father rabbit.

756
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,399
Dad.

757
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:04,239
Let's play together.

758
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,360
He is really

759
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,399
good at Frisbee.

760
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,239
We can form a team.

761
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,199
Your dad's back.

762
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,320
So I'm leaving.

763
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,239
Take it.

764
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,719
I'm leaving.

765
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:13,399
Bye.

766
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,560
Bye, uncle.

767
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,120
Bye.

768
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,520
Dad.

769
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,239
Let's play Frisbee together.

770
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,399
Let's play together.

771
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:24,320
Come here.

772
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:24,760
Come.

773
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,199
Hello, Mr. Yu.

774
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,280
Hello.

775
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,479
We don't play Frisbee.

776
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,439
Right?

777
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,080
We don't play Frisbee.

778
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,879
How boring.

779
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,360
I'll tell you a story

780
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,959
about father rabbit

781
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,360
and mother rabbit.

782
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:40,760
Mother rabbit is so beautiful.

783
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,120
Father rabbit

784
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,760
loves mother rabbit very much.

785
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,879
Sometimes

786
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:48,199
they fight.

787
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:48,840
Right?

788
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:49,679
Then

789
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,000
they broke up.

790
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,520
Right?

791
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,199
But

792
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,879
they will always be a family.

793
00:28:59,199 --> 00:28:59,560
Come on.

794
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,719
Eat eggs.

795
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,040
It is nutritious.

796
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,560
Don't bite chopsticks.

797
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,719
That's impolite.

798
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,520
Behave well.

799
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,560
Aunt.

800
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,120
They are all vegetarian dishes.

801
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,439
Not even a meat dish.

802
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,239
No.

803
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,360
It is a meat dish.

804
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
It's shredded pork.

805
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,280
But it is also meat.

806
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:26,360
Eat it.

807
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,959
Just a little meat.

808
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,800
It is not a meat dish

809
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,040
in our family.

810
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,479
I want to eat meat dishes.

811
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,760
Large meatball.

812
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:34,959
Dongpo's braised pork.

813
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,679
Shank.

814
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,560
Fried chicken.

815
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,120
Fish is also okay.

816
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,320
Except fish,

817
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,639
what you just said

818
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:42,199
is unhealthy food.

819
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,000
These are all

820
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
health foods that I make.

821
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,399
I don't need to keep fit,

822
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
I have to grow up.

823
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
I need nutrition.

824
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,840
Yunjie.

825
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,120
Let it be.

826
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,959
I will buy you

827
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,000
ready-made food tomorrow.

828
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,040
You are not allowed.

829
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,399
Look.

830
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,560
She got pimples on her face

831
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
from eating meat.

832
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,439
She has a phlegm-dampness constitution.

833
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,919
You should be more vegetarian.

834
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,760
Such as yam.

835
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,560
It can help you get rid of dampness.

836
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,959
Eat it.

837
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,919
Forget it.

838
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,280
Let it be.

839
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,919
Dad, bring me

840
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:15,439
the fermented bean curd.

841
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,159
Don't eat too much salt.

842
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,360
This kind of pickled food

843
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,239
is not allowed in our home

844
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,080
in the future,

845
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,639
okay?

846
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,239
Future?

847
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,719
How are your grades?

848
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,600
Where do you rank in your class?

849
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,479
I'm full.

850
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:33,360
I'll do my homework.

851
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:39,840
Yunjie. What are you doing?

852
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:41,679
You

853
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,719
spoil her too much.

854
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,439
She didn't behave well.

855
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:45,760
Jing.

856
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:46,560
Let's eat.

857
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,879
En...

858
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,360
Whatever her ranking,

859
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,919
she must eat meat.

860
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,719
I did it for her own good.

861
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:57,040
Students should be learning-oriented.

862
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,280
We don't talk about studying

863
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,719
when we eat at home.

864
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,080
I have at least

865
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,520
one meat dish

866
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,239
when I cook.

867
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,320
En...

868
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:08,879
Yunjie. Meng'an.

869
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:09,399
They are not

870
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,439
vegetarians.

871
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,239
Besides,

872
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,520
Meng'an is pregnant now.

873
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,719
Yunjie is growing up.

874
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
They need nutrition.

875
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,439
Okay, I get it.

876
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,360
There will be

877
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,040
a meat dish every day from tomorrow,

878
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,760
okay?

879
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,040
I'll cook

880
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,800
later.

881
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,000
No.

882
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,919
I am idle,

883
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,040
but I let you cook.

884
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:27,679
I can't do it.

885
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,959
It's okay.

886
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,000
I have been cooking

887
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,040
at home.

888
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,239
It's normal.

889
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,439
Look.

890
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,679
I treated you

891
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,600
like an emperor

892
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,159
when you were a child.

893
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,560
But now you

894
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,000
are serving others.

895
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,800
You shouldn't say that.

896
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm fine.

897
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,479
I just cook.

898
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,439
Why do you still have such

899
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,399
feudal and backward ideas?

900
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,320
You are

901
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,600
talking nonsense.

902
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,000
It's a fact.

903
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,600
I can't beat you.

904
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,320
Eat.

905
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,280
Yeah.

906
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,560
You are verbose.

907
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,679
Don't talk.

908
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:12,439
Did I cook well?

909
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,120
Don't talk.

910
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,399
What brings you here?

911
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,560
I just got back from a business trip.

912
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,679
I miss my children.

913
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,360
Did you see them?

914
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,239
They get along well with your neighbor.

915
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,719
Then you can leave.

916
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,159
What did you do?

917
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:46,320
Have a class.

918
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,199
Chen Wanzhen.

919
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,239
You said

920
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,479
you would take care of the children,

921
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
so I gave you custody

922
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,560
of them.

923
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,399
I hope

924
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,320
their lives

925
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,479
will not change.

926
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,280
You take them

927
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,199
to and from school as usual.

928
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,280
After school,

929
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,040
you accompany them to do their homework.

930
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,199
You cook

931
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,159
whatever they want to eat.

932
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,040
You sleep

933
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,080
with them.

934
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:09,959
Why?

935
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,040
We are not together.

936
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:11,800
Right?

937
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,280
I don't want their lives

938
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,399
to change much.

939
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:15,479
But what about you?

940
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,000
You want to be a career woman, right?

941
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:18,800
Well.

942
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,520
I support you.

943
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,000
I hope you are well.

944
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:24,159
But you

945
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,800
can't sacrifice

946
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,719
their childhood.

947
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,280
Yu Hai.

948
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,679
You have gone too far.

949
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:29,239
En...

950
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,800
As a mother,

951
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,399
how can you give your

952
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,080
two girls

953
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:34,760
to such

954
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,719
a strange man?

955
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,439
You think this is appropriate?

956
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:39,280
Now the society is so complicated.

957
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:40,719
How unpredictable people are.

958
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:42,879
Don't you know?

959
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:43,520
If you can

960
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:44,919
give them to someone else

961
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,560
to take care of,

962
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,760
so can I.

963
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:48,280
Right?

964
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,360
I can hire some nannies

965
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
to take care of them

966
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,760
with my parents, right?

967
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:55,120
You

968
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,360
left our daughters

969
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,080
in the care of a stranger.

970
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,280
As their father,

971
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,199
I don't agree.

972
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,639
If I

973
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,280
find it again,

974
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,679
I'll see you in court.

975
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,000
Not you.

976
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,639
Don't rush me.

977
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm on my way.

978
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,120
Jing.

979
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,560
I thought about it all day.

980
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,719
I have something to discuss with you.

981
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,960
In a few days, I want to go back to

982
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,080
our hometown

983
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,199
to visit our father's grave.

984
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,319
Let's go together.

985
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,880
What do you mean?

986
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,040
Nothing.

987
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,000
Just homesick.

988
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,279
I haven't been back for a long time.

989
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,040
I see.

990
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:03,120
It's Xu Meng'an who asked you

991
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,799
to kick me back, right?

992
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,639
No.

993
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,759
No.

994
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,440
She doesn't know.

995
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,159
It is I who want to discuss with you.

996
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,400
Look.

997
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,639
I know it's not her.

998
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:17,319
She wants me

999
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,199
to stay a few more days.

1000
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,839
Why do you send me back?

1001
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,719
Look.

1002
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,520
There you are.

1003
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,600
You saw Meng'an,

1004
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,120
my father-in-law

1005
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,639
and Mengxin.

1006
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,719
You have seen them all.

1007
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,319
You've done everything you need to do.

1008
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,600
You should be at ease.

1009
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:39,319
You go back, I won't.

1010
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:41,600
I have to take care of Meng'an.

1011
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,040
I'll do it.

1012
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,920
Well.

1013
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,440
Come back

1014
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,120
when she gives birth.

1015
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,839
Maybe we will

1016
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,080
move to a new home then.

1017
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,560
Right?

1018
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,839
The conditions

1019
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,040
are not good now.

1020
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,120
Li Lin.

1021
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,040
I am your sister.

1022
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,159
You treat me like

1023
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,279
an outsider?

1024
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,159
No.

1025
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,319
I...

1026
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,279
Stop it.

1027
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,199
Such a ungrateful person.

1028
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,920
You forget

1029
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,080
how I

1030
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,639
raised you

1031
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,000
when we were children.

1032
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,199
Our mother died early.

1033
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,719
Our father run the clinic alone.

1034
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,920
I took care of everything

1035
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,600
in our family.

1036
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,920
Was that easy for me?

1037
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:31,799
I washed clothes,

1038
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:32,960
cooked meals

1039
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,880
and attended your parents' meeting.

1040
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,400
You fought with someone else,

1041
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,159
and I would fight for you.

1042
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,440
Well.

1043
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,040
I didn't worry about your study.

1044
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:47,279
But I took care of everything else.

1045
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,040
I

1046
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,639
was not much older than you.

1047
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,920
I was a child, too.

1048
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,199
Nobody cares about me.

1049
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,440
Right?

1050
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,359
You have your own family now.

1051
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,040
Right?

1052
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,679
You forget

1053
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,960
how you grew up.

1054
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,440
You kick me

1055
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,719
out.

1056
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:08,799
Well.

1057
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:09,440
Well.

1058
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,319
Take it easy.

1059
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,839
I shouldn't have said it.

1060
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,560
Sorry.

1061
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,120
Jing.

1062
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,960
I am sorry.

1063
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,239
Just forget I ever said that.

1064
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:15,759
OK?

1065
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,319
En...

1066
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,000
Here you are.

1067
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
You don't know why

1068
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,600
I suddenly came to your home?

1069
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:31,359
So what do you

1070
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,880
mean?

1071
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,560
Let me ask you,

1072
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,080
after Meng'an is pregnant,

1073
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,279
do you want to have it or not?

1074
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,799
Yes, of course.

1075
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:42,920
Meng'an, too?

1076
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,560
Yeah.

1077
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,400
You lied to me.

1078
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,520
Lanxiang told me

1079
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,960
you wanted to

1080
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,920
abort the baby at that time.

1081
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,400
Right?

1082
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,279
Don't listen to Lanxiang.

1083
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:56,159
She talks nonsense.

1084
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,679
We know better than she does.

1085
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,520
Well.

1086
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,920
Meng'an has threatened abortion.

1087
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,920
So we didn't want to tell anyone

1088
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,319
for the first three months.

1089
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,480
We are tight-lipped.

1090
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,520
We don't want to be happy

1091
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,600
for nothing.

1092
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,560
Right?

1093
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,920
You wanted children at that time.

1094
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,480
Right?

1095
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,159
Yeah.

1096
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:16,480
Yeah.

1097
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,440
Well.

1098
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,759
I told Meng'an about the second child.

1099
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,560
I didn't expect

1100
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,199
her to take it to heart.

1101
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,400
Yeah.

1102
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,319
Well.

1103
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,080
You can rest assured.

1104
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:35,400
Yeah.

1105
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,480
OK.

1106
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,239
Jing.

1107
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,799
Let's

1108
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,719
choose a good day.

1109
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
The big bed at home

1110
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,000
is more comfortable than the small bed.

1111
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,560
Let me tell you,

1112
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,239
don't worry about me.

1113
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,440
I can sleep on the ground.

1114
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,960
Meng'an is in early stages of pregnancy

1115
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,799
and may have miscarriage at any time.

1116
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,600
Once we've ensured the pregnancy is stable

1117
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,719
and her belly has grown,

1118
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,480
that's when I'll consider

1119
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,639
whether to stay or go.

1120
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,560
OK?

1121
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:06,839
OK?

1122
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:29,639
You can't drink it.

1123
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:31,799
Give it to me.

1124
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,239
The coke

1125
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,199
just taken out of the refrigerator

1126
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:37,960
can't be drunk.

1127
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,319
It's unhealthy, you know?

1128
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,600
Have you finished your homework?

1129
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,319
Yeah.

1130
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,520
Really?

1131
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,040
Or what?

1132
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,679
Need fresh air

1133
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,239
I will accompany you.

1134
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,359
Dad, come on.

1135
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
Come back early.

1136
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,040
Where can I get some air?

1137
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,120
Go back to my room.

1138
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,120
So cool.

1139
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,040
I don't need wellness,

1140
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,000
I want joy.

1141
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,000
What are you gonna do now?

1142
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,719
Your aunt won't leave?

1143
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,679
My mother is annoying enough.

1144
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,040
But my aunt

1145
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,239
is more annoying than my mother.

1146
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:48,960
Fifteen times

1147
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,880
as much as my mother.

1148
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:51,839
Quite accurate.

1149
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,480
He Lu, let me ask you a question.

1150
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,719
Was it planned or accidental

1151
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,639
that your mother

1152
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,799
gave birth to your brother?

1153
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,400
Of course, it was planned.

1154
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,359
They are all premeditated.

1155
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,319
They taught us

1156
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,440
not to lie

1157
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,480
but to be honest.

1158
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,040
But

1159
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,920
they lie to

1160
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,960
get what

1161
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,839
they want.

1162
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:19,319
No.

1163
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,639
I need another drink.

1164
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,560
One more drink.

1165
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:28,880
Here I am.

1166
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:30,719
Mr. Yu.

1167
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,920
Here is your Frisbee.

1168
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,679
I brought it for you.

1169
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,799
En...

1170
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,839
Do you know

1171
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,000
how to play it?

1172
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,319
It usually needs

1173
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,400
more than two people.

1174
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,319
Throw it and catch it.

On the Internet, I saw people holding it

1176
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,279
to interact with dogs.

1177
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:46,080
Dogs can.

1178
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:47,319
So can you.

1179
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,480
OK.

1180
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,759
Thank you.

1181
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,080
Good night. Mr. Yu.
