00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:48,480
Just in Time EP12

3
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,199
When does the music festival start?

4
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,559
Soon.

5
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:54,999
Hurry on over!

6
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,240
Move it up.

7
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,120
Really?

8
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
Of course.

9
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,839
I love you, Mom!

10
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,999
Thanks, Dad!

11
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:02,800
Wait,

12
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,279
take your phone with you.

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,760
Got it.

14
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,079
Thanks, thanks.

15
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:08,880
I'm off!

16
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,040
Have fun!

17
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,559
Okay.

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,160
Remember to have lunch!

19
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,520
Okay.

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,680
Call if you need anything.

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,279
You spoiled her.

22
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,079
Look at our...

23
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,039
He Lu!

24
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,879
Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Li!

25
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,999
Didn't Liu Siming

26
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:22,680
get himself

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,080
a chance to show off?

28
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,800
Thanks to you.

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,920
Let' go!

30
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,480
Hurry!

31
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,159
Let' go!

32
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,120
They actually

33
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,960
got their way.

34
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,759
It would be wasteful

35
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:00,999
not to use the tickets.

36
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,080
You just keep spoiling her.

37
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,240
As long as

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,240
we're

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,559
assured the kids are safe,

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,759
we can rest easy.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
They're in the ninth grade,

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,400
and be burden with great pressure.

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,279
They're exhausted.

44
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,520
It's beneficial for them

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
to unwind occasionally,

46
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:13,960
and

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,599
balance study with leisure,

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,920
to improve their performances.

49
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,559
Since they're already here,

50
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,839
let's allow them to enjoy themselves.

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,279
By the way, Meng'an,

52
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:20,839
do you two have plans

53
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,240
to go anywhere else today?

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,080
Yeah.

55
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,200
Then we'll stay here

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,279
and wait for them.

57
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,439
You guys can head home first.

58
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,599
Okay.

59
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:30,920
Okay.

60
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,039
Thanks for this.

61
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,520
It's no big deal.

62
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,839
Don't mention it.

63
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,240
We'll head off now.

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,640
Okay.

65
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,279
Don't worry.

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:36,960
Goodbye.

67
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Goodbye.

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,159
What's wrong?

69
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,480
I noticed you

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,439
seemed uncomfortable.

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,879
Got a bellyache.

72
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,960
Bellyache?

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,439
Yes, with a dropping sensation.

74
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,439
When did it begin?

75
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,719
I started feeling unwell

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,159
a couple of days ago.

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,200
What should we do now?

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,200
Let's go home first.

79
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:08,960
Okay.

80
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,719
Hurts so badly?

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,439
It feels like... like I'm bleeding.

82
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,759
Hospital.

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,439
Let's go.

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,480
We're going to the hospital.

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Hang in there.

86
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,160
Be careful.

87
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:29,999
Hold on.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm pregnant.

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,559
I had a feeling before.

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
What kind of feeling?

91
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
I don't want this baby.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,280
Honey,

93
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,680
we can give it a shot.

94
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,759
For what?

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,280
Having a second child?

96
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:19,959
We shall never

97
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,600
rush into any decisions.

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,079
Let's think it over.

99
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,680
Meng'an,

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Have you really

101
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,680
thought it through?

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,439
No.

103
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,360
What's your opinion?

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
You want the truth?

105
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,439
I want this baby.

106
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,160
How is it?

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,360
It still hurts?

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,280
We're almost there.

109
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
Almost there.

110
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,360
Hold on.

111
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,639
Almost.

112
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,199
Threatened abortion

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
due to low progesterone.

114
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Maintain the pregnancy or not?

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,559
Maintain.

116
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,240
Maintain it.

117
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,199
Maintain it.

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,120
Please.

119
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,720
I'll prescribe some medication for you.

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,759
Please.

121
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,800
Look at your girl.

122
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,559
Everyone else is out except her.

123
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,959
She drives me crazy every day.

124
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,559
Honey,

125
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,999
on the way back,

126
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,439
please don't scold Lulu anymore.

127
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,280
Kids these days

128
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,559
are so fragile and rebellious.

129
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,280
If we continue this way,

130
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,639
she won't heed our words anymore.

131
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,999
Fine, I got it.

132
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,199
She drives me nuts.

133
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,240
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. He.

134
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,199
You just keep playing.

135
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Well, we had to wait

136
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
for our favorite band

137
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,120
to finish.

138
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,680
When will you

139
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,240
be so keen to studying?

140
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:17,439
Mrs. He,

141
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,160
where are my mom and dad?

142
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,879
They've left.

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,840
Aren't they going on a long trip?

144
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,519
Your mom asked us to take you

145
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,600
to your grandma's place.

146
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,559
Thanks, Mrs. He.

147
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:28,800
Thanks, Mr. He.

148
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,399
Let's get in the car.

149
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,240
The calm before the storm.

150
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,680
When I get home,

151
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,600
it's bound to be another storm.

152
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,039
So what will you do?

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,919
If it comes to it,

154
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,960
I'll use my trump card.

155
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:49,679
I'll say they

156
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,999
only care about my brother, not me.

157
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,759
Your parents really trust you.

158
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,759
They don't even keep an eye on you,

159
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,360
just went back to the hometown.

160
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,679
I'm so jealous of you,

161
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,679
dodging a bullet.

162
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
Rest up in the car.

163
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,279
Save your energy.

164
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,560
You'll need it for the challenges ahead.

165
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,679
Good luck.

166
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,360
Good luck.

167
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,039
I'll ride.

168
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,759
I didn't ask you.

169
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,759
Let's go.

170
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,960
I went to a music festival today.

171
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,480
So much fun.

172
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
If you were there,

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,480
you would enjoy it too.

174
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,360
Really?

175
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,120
It was you who brought me

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
to my first music festival.

177
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,039
Really?

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,360
I recall it now.

179
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,600
That was so long ago.

180
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,679
Back when your uncle and I

181
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,999
were still dating.

182
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,879
Time flies.

183
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,080
We were so free back then.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,799
I remember

185
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,279
it was my first time seeing a band,

186
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,840
first time drinking Coke,

187
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,560
first time eating ice cream.

188
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,480
Despite getting an earful from my mom,

189
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,240
it was worth it.

190
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,919
Not just you,

191
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,560
I was nearly scolded to death too.

192
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,679
You have no idea,

193
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,560
she's been berating me since I was young,

194
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,879
always wanting to meddle in everything.

195
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,519
Sometimes

196
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,840
even your grandparents don't bother with me;

197
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,799
it's all your mom.

198
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,159
At least you've got grandma spoiling you.

199
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,999
I had it way worse.

200
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,360
My mom was super strict.

201
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:09,840
My dad didn't have much say

202
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
at home.

203
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,039
I just hoped my grandparents

204
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,679
would come

205
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,560
to the rescue.

206
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,600
It shows that back then,

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
what happened to me

208
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,080
is now happening to you.

209
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,879
My sister really

210
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
had a tough time.

211
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,799
Looking back,

212
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,480
I'm really grateful to your mom.

213
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,159
When I was little,

214
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,159
I didn't do well in school.

215
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,240
Your mom was really worried.

216
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,159
When she got anxious, she'd scold me.

217
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,879
When she scolded me,

218
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,600
I'd doodle all over my textbooks.

219
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,120
Later,

220
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,159
your mom found it out.

221
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,560
I thought,

222
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,840
"I am done for it",

223
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,360
and was ready for another lecture,

224
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,999
but instead, she checked the drawings,

225
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,759
and remarked, "Pretty well,

226
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,759
you got some real talent here."

227
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,440
She decided to take me to art classes.

228
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,560
She said, "If academics aren't your thing,

229
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:53,879
then

230
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,840
don't bother with exam,

231
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,480
focus on art,

232
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,399
and aim for college."

233
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,999
So every week,

234
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,759
she'd take me to

235
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,360
art class.

236
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,039
It was over an hour's

237
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,519
bus ride.

238
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,279
It was tough.

239
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,679
I was sitting there learning sketching,

240
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,879
and your mom brought a small chair,

241
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,679
and sat next to me writing news articles

242
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,999
without even a table.

243
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,960
Seems like my mom

244
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,799
had sharp eyes.

245
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,360
She spotted your talent.

246
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,919
I didn't think so back then,

247
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,720
I hated her for it.

248
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,560
I felt she was taking up

249
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,240
my only weekend break.

250
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,080
Now that I think I was pretty silly.

251
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm really grateful to your mom

252
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,440
for pushing me back then.

253
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Otherwise,

254
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,080
I would never make it to college.

255
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,279
You know,

256
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,200
a lot of my good classmates

257
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
didn't go to college.

258
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,360
Their lives are really tough now.

259
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,440
So,

260
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,360
even though I cried a lot back then,

261
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm still really thankful to your mom.

262
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,360
If I hadn't gone to college,

263
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,240
I wouldn't have

264
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
ended up in design,

265
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,999
and wouldn't have started a business

266
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,120
with your uncle.

267
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,240
I think uncle

268
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
is really a good guy.

269
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,999
He's been so great to you.

270
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,560
I need to find a husband

271
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,960
as exceptional as my uncle.

272
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,679
No, no, no.

273
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,360
That's really not necessary.

274
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,200
Just look at me.

275
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,560
Now,

276
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,360
I have no freedom at all.

277
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,039
Whose fault is that?

278
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,120
It's all your uncle's fault.

279
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,360
Had an abortion?

280
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,679
How could you let her make it?

281
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,759
Not here.

282
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,879
Outside.

283
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,560
Didn't do it?

284
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,039
That's great.

285
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:38,999
You scared me

286
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:39,639
to death!

287
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,679
Li Lin.

288
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,399
You need to

289
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,639
talk to sis

290
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,039
seriously.

291
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm backing you up.

292
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:46,560
Listen,

293
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,519
I've figured everything out.

294
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,560
I gave Meng'an some money before

295
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,759
but she didn't accept it.

296
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,840
Now I'll give you the money,

297
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,720
just tell her it's the funds

298
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,759
from your school.

299
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,200
So...

300
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,039
No need for money.

301
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,919
Meng'an has already decided

302
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,560
to keep the baby.

303
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,480
What?

304
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:58,799
Keep the baby!

305
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,320
Awesome!

306
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,799
You're amazing, Li Lin.

307
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,480
Well done!

308
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
I said you should have the baby.

309
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,879
Don't you lie to me, okay?

310
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,879
You're something else.

311
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,960
You can even convince Meng'an

312
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
to change her mind.

313
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,320
I see you usually

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,039
listening to her every word.

315
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,639
You're quite persuasive.

316
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,200
It's not me convincing her.

317
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,039
She figured it out

318
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,159
herself.

319
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,480
She wants the baby, that's what matters.

320
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,840
Li Lin,

321
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,399
you need to keep a close eye on her,

322
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,759
otherwise, she may change her mind

323
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,560
and seek an abortion.

324
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:34,759
No, no, no.

325
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,399
What if she wakes up and regrets it?

326
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,080
I'll go and check.

327
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,679
No, no, no.

328
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,639
Get back.

329
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,999
Why are you so worked up?

330
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,759
It's too early to be this happy.

331
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,919
Some situation

332
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,999
is a bit complicated.

333
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,360
It's just having a baby.

334
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,279
It's just raising a child.

335
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,480
I'm

336
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,320
backing you up.

337
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,240
Can you stop patting me?

338
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,360
Can you let me finish?

339
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,159
Just muttering back-up...

340
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,360
and speaking so loudly.

341
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,200
Alright.

342
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:01,879
Go ahead.

343
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,519
Meng'an had a threatened miscarriage.

344
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,879
The doctor says she needs to

345
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,840
stay in the hospital for observation.

346
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,039
She just got that

347
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,999
shot to keep the baby.

348
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,039
Got it?

349
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,039
So we don't know yet

350
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,159
what will happen next.

351
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,960
Nothing to be pleased about.

352
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,159
Perhaps we

353
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,840
want the baby,

354
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,080
yet the God doesn't permit.

355
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,159
You should stay optimistic.

356
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
We've already made a big step,

357
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,039
from firmly not wanting the baby,

358
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,600
to trying to keep it, right?

359
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,879
Didn't Mengxin go through the same thing?

360
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,759
She's expecting her second child.

361
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,519
When she was pregnant with our first child,

362
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,840
we faced numerous challenges.

363
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,960
The doctors said the same, sometimes,

364
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:41,840
the progesterone level is too low,

365
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,600
sometimes too high,

366
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,279
which frightened us

367
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,159
greatly.

368
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,799
But wasn't xiongxiong born healthy?

369
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,080
Yeah,

370
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,200
I recall that

371
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,999
Meng'an

372
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,560
also experienced threatened miscarriage

373
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,440
when she's carrying Yunjie.

374
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,600
So,

375
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,159
get the treatment,

376
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,519
and keep the baby.

377
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,679
As long as sis has changed her mind,

378
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,440
that's a good thing.

379
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:03,519
So,

380
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,120
let it be.

381
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,159
Li Lin,

382
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,440
how did you

383
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,080
convince her?

384
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,200
I tried to get her to the company

385
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,320
to work as a consultant

386
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,240
and earn some extra money.

387
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,440
But she wouldn't agree.

388
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,279
It wasn't me convincing her.

389
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,600
She made the decision.

390
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,999
But as for how she came to that

391
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:25,480
I...

392
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,399
I don't know.

393
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,960
Haowen,

394
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,279
how did you know?

395
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,519
Mengxin told you that?

396
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Yes...

397
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,720
You know

398
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,159
Mengxin

399
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,399
can't keep secrets.

400
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,799
She's very straightforward.

401
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,960
Is that so?

402
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,679
You've given yourself away.

403
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,960
You just said

404
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,159
you advised Meng'an.

405
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,240
Is that what you said?

406
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,039
Still making things up

407
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,840
Come on.

408
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,120
Answer me,

409
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,560
when you said that

410
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,999
did Meng'an scold you?

411
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,399
Did she give you an earful?

412
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,399
Of course she did.

413
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,080
Well, I'm willing to give it a try

414
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,679
for the sake of the family.

415
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,799
Where there's a will, there's a way.

416
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,039
That's my motto.

417
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,600
Haowen,

418
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,439
sorry for troubling you.

419
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,040
In this regard,

420
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:22,879
I really need to learn from you.

421
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:24,280
You're right.

422
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,679
Where there's a will, there's a way.

423
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,040
That's so true.

424
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,199
Where there's a will, there's a way.

425
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,280
Are you hungry?

426
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,439
No.

427
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,120
No, you are hungry.

428
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:37,959
No, I'm not.

429
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:38,919
Come on, let's grab something.

430
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:39,439
I'm really not.

431
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,000
You're hungry.

432
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,439
Let's go.

433
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,520
Why must I be hungry?

434
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,560
I've already eaten.

435
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,120
How do you feel? Better?

436
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,040
-Not that much. -Much better.

437
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,719
Not that much?

438
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,399
Check for a fever.

439
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:48,760
It is gone.

440
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,679
See?

441
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,159
It's fine.

442
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,320
Come on, Zhenzhen.

444
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,639
Good, fever's gone.

445
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,399
What's wrong?

446
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,159
I don't know.

447
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:00,600
On my way.

448
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:02,479
I open the door.

449
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,199
Why aren't you happy?

450
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:06,879
On my way.

451
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,639
Dr. Yu.

452
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,239
Miss Chen.

453
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:19,479
How are the children?

454
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:20,120
Has the fever gone down?

455
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,080
Much better.

456
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,040
I made some rice soup.

457
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,560
They have just recovered

458
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,800
and should avoid spicy food.

459
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,639
It's best to eat something light.

460
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:26,760
No need.

461
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,199
They've already eaten.

462
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,280
Already?

463
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:36,719
Have you eaten yet?

464
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,000
I...

465
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:39,679
I

466
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,159
knew it.

467
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,560
You were so busy looking after the kids

468
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,320
that you skipped a meal.

469
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,760
You need to eat something.

470
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,560
Then you can have energy

471
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,479
to care for them.

472
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,560
Okay, thank you.

473
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,679
You're welcome.

474
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:51,399
Thanks.

475
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:54,840
I'm leaving.

476
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:56,959
Thank you.

477
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:57,879
Bye.

478
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,959
Haowen,

479
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,800
since I became

480
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,040
your brother-in-law,

481
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,760
the places we eat at

482
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,199
become worse and worse.

483
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:11,879
Come on,

484
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,879
Li Lin.

485
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,560
Let's have a toast

486
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,000
to celebrate

487
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,760
today's happiness.

488
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,199
Cheers.

489
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,719
Li Lin.

490
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,959
I just returned from another city today

491
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,320
and learned that Meng'an underwent surgery,

492
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,199
which had me worried.

493
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,080
I didn't dare ask Xin about it,

494
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:33,040
for she would fall out

495
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,280
with anyone who brought up

496
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,199
the topic of childbirth.

497
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,399
Why?

498
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,439
isn't Mengxin

499
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,520
also expecting a second child now?

500
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,679
I'm really hard at home.

501
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,080
Really.

502
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,840
She's fixated on it now.

503
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,600
She feels

504
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,239
that I tricked her into having a child.

505
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:50,479
But I really want

506
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,760
to have a second child.

507
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,679
Parents also helped.

508
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,959
Who doesn't want

509
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,399
a lively home

510
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,399
with an extra little baby.

511
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,280
Mengxin is right,

512
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,080
it is you who want a second baby.

513
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
So I am.

514
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:03,679
I'm at home

515
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,879
being her servant,

516
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,479
I'll do whatever she wants.

517
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,159
Once our baby

518
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:08,080
is born,

519
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,719
I'll kneel and bow to her,

520
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,840
and call her grandma.

521
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,239
Oh my,

522
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,760
your family's is really mixed up.

523
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,639
When we were

524
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:18,560
drinking last time,

525
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
you were so happy

526
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,600
to hear about the second child.

527
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:23,840
Today, hearing this

528
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,879
I really think you

529
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:25,800
are not easy.

530
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,120
Let me ask you,

531
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,399
with a second child coming,

532
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,320
what preparations

533
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,959
do we need to make?

534
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,639
Or,

535
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,360
are there any changes?

536
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,000
Lin,

537
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,239
there are huge changes.

538
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,199
It's like a woman

539
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,760
becoming a fierce tiger.

540
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:42,840
What fierce tiger?

541
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,000
Meng'an didn't behave this way

542
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,800
when carrying Yunjie.

543
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:46,800
It wasn't like this.

544
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,239
Li Lin.

545
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,679
I'm speaking the truth.

546
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:49,800
Even though they are sisters,

547
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,679
and born of the same mother.

548
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:51,760
Their temperaments are very different.

549
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,399
You know,

550
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
my back, my waist

551
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,120
and my shoulders

552
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,719
and my arms are bruised

553
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,360
because of her.

554
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,840
But I withstood it all.

555
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,560
I accept it.

556
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,760
I believe where there's a will, there's a way.

557
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,159
Is that really true?

558
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,159
Meng'an wouldn't do that.

559
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,080
Li Lin.

560
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,479
Mengxin is about to give birth.

561
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm sure

562
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,399
my baby will be born before yours.

563
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,600
So as someone who's been through it,

564
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,639
I need to tell you something.

565
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,560
Stop it.

566
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,320
Where there's a will, there's a way.

567
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,719
Wrong.

568
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,760
Pretend to be weak to stay safe.

569
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,479
I can handle this.

570
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,280
Wanwan, Zhenzhen,

571
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,080
Dr. Yu sent us some rice soup,

572
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,040
who wants it?

573
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,560
Me.

574
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,280
I want some.

575
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,320
Come quickly.

576
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:49,679
Alright, one bowl each.

577
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,280
This is mine.

578
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,679
Here, Zhenzhen.

579
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,120
Thank you, Mom.

580
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,600
You're awake.

581
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:20,959
What time is it?

582
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,159
It's already dark.

583
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:24,320
I...

584
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,040
Did I sleep

585
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,399
for a really long time?

586
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,159
I feel like I slept very deeply.

587
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,040
Very deeply.

588
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:30,719
Really?

589
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:31,560
That's great

590
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:32,840
I've never seen you

591
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,879
sleep so well.

592
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:35,040
Is that so?

593
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,800
Would you like some water?

594
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:39,879
No, thanks.

595
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,879
Some fruit I've just washed?

596
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,120
I don't want any.

597
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,639
Alright.

598
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,439
Does it still hurt?

599
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,719
It doesn't hurt anymore.

600
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,560
Much better.

601
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,560
The medicine is quite effective.

602
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,840
You still have a good constitution.

603
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,600
Right?

604
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,080
I

605
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,479
wonder,

606
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:06,959
why did you suddenly

607
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,280
decide to keep the baby?

608
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,639
I don't know.

609
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
You don't know?

610
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,239
There...

611
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,479
has to be a reason.

612
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:22,560
You

613
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:23,919
just make up an excuse.

614
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:26,280
An excuse?

615
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:26,959
Yes.

616
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,600
Let me make up

617
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,800
an excuse.

618
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:34,919
Yes.

619
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,120
I...

620
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,199
Let me think.

621
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,080
Actually, it's because on the way here,

622
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,159
when I looked at you

623
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,760
I suddenly felt quite sorry for you.

624
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:53,399
I feel

625
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,199
that I've lived more than forty years,

626
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,679
and it's been quite smooth.

627
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,479
I haven't met any major setbacks

628
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,159
at work.

629
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,080
And my parents are still alive.

630
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,959
I'm not like you,

631
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,600
I haven't lost any loved ones.

632
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,159
So...

633
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,600
However, when I had the bellyache,

634
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,479
I was extremely

635
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:15,199
frightened.

636
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,959
I thought,

637
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:19,760
if I lost this baby,

638
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,639
I...

639
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,000
I...

640
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:24,800
No, no, no.

641
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,479
This is not a good excuse.

642
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,800
Let me organize my thoughts.

643
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Otherwise, just

644
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:35,159
consider me a mammal.

645
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:37,239
A

646
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,439
high-level mammal.

647
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,320
A female,

648
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:41,959
mammal.

649
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay?

650
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
That's a pretty good excuse.

651
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,959
The logic is clear.

652
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,439
Really?

653
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,040
But do you think this decision

654
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,959
might be a bit hasty?

655
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,399
Not hasty.

656
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,000
It's really good.

657
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,679
I feel really happy.

658
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,600
Really?

659
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:09,760
Really.

660
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,399
When you were asleep just now,

661
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,560
I thought a lot.

662
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,639
I thought when Yunjie

663
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,760
was just born.

664
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,399
It was fifteen years ago, right?

665
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,679
When she was born,

666
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,080
she was that tiny,

667
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
less than 3 kilos.

668
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,040
That tiny girl,

669
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,800
her head flopping gently to one side,

670
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,439
her skin delicate

671
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,560
and wrinkled -

672
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,479
I was afraid to even hold her,

673
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,080
for fear of hurting her.

674
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,199
Yet, I really adored her.

675
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:46,239
In the blink of an eye,

676
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,919
she's fourteen,

677
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:49,760
right?

678
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:51,040
She's now in the ninth grade,

679
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,479
and has learned to deceive us with friends.

680
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,800
Of course it's not her fault,

681
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,399
it must be Liu Siming.

682
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,320
He's full of tricks.

683
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,800
And what did he say?

684
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:01,520
A protector of flowers?

685
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,959
What flowers is he protecting?

686
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,239
What kind of protector is he?

687
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,719
He's just a little brat,

688
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:06,479
still wet behind the ears.

689
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,479
And don't forget about me,

690
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm her dad,

691
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,879
and I'm still around.

692
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:09,679
right?

693
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:11,760
Yes.

694
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,239
In two years,

695
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,760
Yunjie will really have

696
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,959
a protector of flowers.

697
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,320
That's for sure.

698
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,520
At that time,

699
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,479
where will I be?

700
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,600
I'll have to step aside.

701
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:26,959
Think about my dad.

702
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,360
It's too scary.

703
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:35,879
I still have to

704
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:37,320
be good to my father-in-law.

705
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,320
He's had a tough time.

706
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,040
Can I go home once I am done

707
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
with this bottle of medicine?

708
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,239
The doctor didn't say you can leave.

709
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,280
Can you ask for me?

710
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,040
Okay,

711
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,159
I'll go ask.

712
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,360
Such a daughter slave.

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,760
♪Come on♪

714
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,320

♪Listening to me♪

717
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,040
How much have you drunk?

718
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,159
What's going on?

719
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,000
Xin,

720
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,080
I have some great news to share,

721
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,159
a major celebration in our family.

722
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
All this fuss.

723
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,840
What's the news?

724
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:44,879
Let me tell you...

725
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,840
Forget it.

726
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,520
You'd yell at me if I say it.

727
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,399
Who cares

728
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,520
whether you speak or not?

729
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:54,600
Every day

730
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,439
you drink,

731
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:56,399
socializing,

732
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,679
out with some shady friends

733
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,719
wasting time.

734
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,080
What serious matter could there be?

735
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,879
Honey,

736
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,320
hanging out with shady friends

737
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,600
isn't a big deal.

738
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,199
This is a big deal.

739
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,840
I'm telling you,

740
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:08,840
if I tell you the news,

741
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,080
you'll think I'm the hero in our family.

742
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,360
I've done something great, honey.

743
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,919
Really.

744
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,639
It's a very happy event.

745
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,080
I'm ready.

746
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,679
Go ahead.

747
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,879
I really can't tell you.

748
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:22,520
Honey.

749
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,080
I have to keep my secret.

750
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,199
I really can't...

751
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,520
Get out.

752
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,600
To where?

753
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Go sleep in the study.

754
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:29,639
So you won't snore and disturb me

755
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:30,479
while I'm trying to sleep.

756
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,639
Why should I sleep in the study?

757
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,159
If you won't share the news,

758
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:32,719
then get out.

759
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:34,600
Fine,

760
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,360
my wife told me to leave,

761
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,320
so I will.

762
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I'll leave.

763
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,639
I'm leaving.

764
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,360
Why are you still here?

765
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:52,360
Don't you want to know this news?

766
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,479
Don't want to.

767
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,600
Don't regret it.

768
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,679
No regrets.

769
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,879
Really, don't regret it.

770
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,280
Alright, I can't keep

771
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,080
it a secret anymore.

772
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,239
Let me tell you, honey.

773
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,080
Go ahead.

774
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,679
What are you packing?

775
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,760
Yunjie didn't bring anything.

776
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,280
She has class on Monday.

777
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,520
So hurry up and pack it

778
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,560
and send it to her.

779
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,520
That'll be suspicious.

780
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,000
Gosh, we're supposed to be in the hometown.

781
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,719
Yes.

782
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,199
Why don't we ask Mengxin to deliver it?

783
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,840
Haowen said

784
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,360
it's best not to let Mengxin know.

785
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,639
She's very sensitive about

786
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,280
having a second child.

787
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,239
How about calling

788
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,040
Haowen?

789
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,199
To have his driver make a trip.

790
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,679
It will work.

791
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,679
I'll call him.

792
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,159
How long do we need to

793
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,840
keep it a secret?

794
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,040
We'll have to tell her sooner or later.

795
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,000
First make sure the pregnancy is stable.

796
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,239
If, unfortunately, we can't,

797
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,639
it'll all be in vain.

798
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,239
Alright.

799
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,040
We'll tell her and mom when the time comes.

800
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,879
Be sure to remind Haowen

801
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,879
to keep it to himself.

802
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,679
For now, this should stay between us three.

803
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,800
Alright.

804
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,280
Hello.

805
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,560
Haowen.

806
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,080
Will you come back for dinner?

807
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,679
An went to the hospital?

808
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,199
Mom went to the hospital?

809
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,159
What's wrong?

810
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,360
What's wrong?

811
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:48,919
Grandpa,

812
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,040
can I use your phone?

813
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:02,719
Dad.

814
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,159
Mom.

815
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,399
Yunjie.

816
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,320
Why are you at home?

817
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,840
Aren't you going to your aunt's house?

818
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,760
Well,

819
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,600
we ran into some trouble.

820
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,199
Honey,

821
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,879
Yunjie is on the phone.

822
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,399
I'll come back to find you later.

823
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,239
Don't come back for now.

824
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,360
Stay at your grandmother's place for now.

825
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:26,199
Yunjie,

826
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,000
tell them to come back.

827
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,159
Grandpa wants you to come back.

828
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,239
No, no, you can't come back.

829
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,800
You can't come back

830
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,679
An,

831
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,639
you had a viral cold, right?

832
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,800
Just rest at home.

833
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,439
You might spread it to us.

834
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:42,919
Yes.

835
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,760
Look, I'm still coughing.

836
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,000
Yunjie, we don't come home for now.

837
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,760
Severe condition.

838
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,000
Alright then.

839
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:53,840
Yunjie,

840
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,000
behave good at your grandmother's place.

841
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,479
I'll bring the backpack

842
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,679
to you later.

843
00:31:58,919 --> 00:31:59,520
Dad,

844
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:01,360
mom has a viral cold,

845
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,040
wear a mask

846
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,360
or you'll catch it too.

847
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,560
Alright, alright.

848
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,679
I'll wear a mask too,

849
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,800
and won't spread it to Dad.

850
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,959
Yunjie,

851
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:10,840
Stay at grandma's house

852
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,239
and act good for a few days,

853
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,719
and I'll come to get you once feel better.

854
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,360
Okay, take care of yourself.

855
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,600
Alas,

856
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,520
I just finished teaching her not to lie,

857
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
and here I am lying.

858
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,520
Why did my mom

859
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,959
lie like this?

860
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:30,959
I have to cover for her.

861
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,639
It...

862
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,879
It's not lying, it's...

863
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,679
hiding part of the truth.

864
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,120
What about the part that's fabricated?

865
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,479
Old people's lie isn't seen as lying.

866
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,560
Could it be

867
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,439
that my mom knows I'm pregnant?

868
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:50,679
Haowen.

869
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
When Haowen

870
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,879
will

871
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:01,159
ever learn to keep a secret?

872
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:02,760
He's driving me crazy.

873
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:06,639
Mengxin is here.

874
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:07,679
Move aside.

875
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,040
Hi there.

876
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,760
What's meant to come will come.

877
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,399
Sis,

878
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,719
Xin,

879
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,959
you're in for a tough time.

880
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,320
What can I say.

881
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,560
Don't cry.

882
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:32,679
Don't cry.

883
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,879
There's no suffering.

884
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:35,320
Well,

885
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:37,760
Haowen didn't come with you?

886
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,320
He's outside.

887
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,199
Be good.

888
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,520
Don't cry.

889
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,000
Why the sigh?

890
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,679
Li Lin.

891
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,959
I'm so disappointed in you

892
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,159
Haowen.

893
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,239
Even though I'm your brother-in-law,

894
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,360
you're a few years older than me,

895
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,239
but you shouldn't lie to me.

896
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,479
I'm not lying, Li Lin.

897
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,800
This is good news.

898
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,959
Good news should be shared.

899
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,840
Can't secretly

900
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,439
enjoy it

901
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:15,959
to myself.

902
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:16,440
What do you think?

903
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,480
What about Mom?

904
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,520
Did you tell her too?

905
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:23,040
I didn't say anything

906
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,040
You didn't?

907
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,960
I really didn't.

908
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,759
Then who did?

909
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,440
Xin told her.

910
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:29,719
She can't keep a secret.

911
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,679
Definitely she.

912
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,520
Again?

913
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,279
Poor Xin,

914
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,679
I feel sorry for her.

915
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:35,359
She has to

916
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,040
shoulder all the blame

917
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,359
by herself.

918
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,040
Li Lin,

919
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,920
let me tell you,

920
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,560
this morning

921
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,400
I came to help you

922
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,960
prepare the maternity meal.

923
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,359
I can manage without your assistance.

924
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:46,520
It's not the same.

925
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,199
I've got a second baby.

926
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,080
I'm more experienced.

927
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,480
Really?

928
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:49,880
How so?

929
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,560
A second baby is different?

930
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,400
Of course it is.

931
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,040
How different?

932
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,679
It requires more balanced nutrition,

933
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,199
and a more sensible combination.

934
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,759
You should take notes.

935
00:34:58,759 --> 00:34:59,679
You're pretty articulate.

936
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,239
Of course.

937
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,560
You're a knowledgeable person.

938
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
You don't have to work today.

939
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,520
Alright.

940
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,799
Show me

941
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:06,560
what you can do.

942
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,000
Cutting grapes

943
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,799
like this?

944
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:09,199
The stems

945
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,080
are still on.

946
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
Li Lin,

947
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
Xin is really picky.

948
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,600
Why cut the grapes?

949
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,520
If I tear them by hand,

950
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,799
she won't eat them if they're torn.

951
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:17,600
Hard to please.

952
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:18,560
It's even worse now.

953
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,120
You know?

954
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,880
So it's not easy for you.

955
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,839
Learn from this.

956
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,839
Li Lin.

957
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,560
That's good.

958
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,359
When you're available,

959
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
come by our place more often

960
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,400
and cook sometimes.

961
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,159
I could use a break.

962
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,679
No problem.

963
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,000
As long as sis is willing to have the kid.

964
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,279
I'm studying game strategies.

965
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
Got some good news.

966
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,120
Want to hear it?

967
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,920
What's the good news?

968
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:03,600
Guess.

969
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,239
Stocks went up.

970
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:05,799
Try again.

971
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,000
Pension and social insurance increased.

972
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,040
Wrong.

973
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,440
Your dance partner

974
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,799
is back.

975
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:13,880
Button it.

976
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,359
So,

977
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,679
what's the good news?

978
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,639
This is interesting.

979
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,239
You know why Meng'an

980
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,679
hasn't shown up

981
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,040
for two weeks?

982
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,000
Isn't she sick?

983
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,679
You believe that?

984
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:26,080
That's what you told me.

985
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,639
Alright.

986
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,799
What's going on? Hurry up.

987
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm dying of curiosity.

988
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,719
Meng'an

989
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,199
Has...

990
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:35,880
What?

991
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,199
Meng'an is...

992
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,159
What is she having?

993
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,759
A second baby.

994
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,480
Are you serious?

995
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,199
Meng'an is having a second baby.

996
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,199
Come on.

997
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,120
Such a big deal.

998
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,639
How could you hide this from me?

999
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,600
The pregnancy was unstable.

1000
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:16,560
But you should have

1001
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,159
told me right away.

1002
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,520
I'm your sister.

1003
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

1004
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,159
My bad.

1005
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,440
Don't worry.

1006
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,759
It's similar to my early pregnancy.

1007
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:27,799
Just take some progesterone.

1008
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,839
How old are you?

1009
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:29,839
How old am I?

1010
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:30,759
It's not the same.

1011
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:32,679
It'll be fine, trust me.

1012
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:34,279
I'm more experienced

1013
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:35,279
with the second baby.

1014
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,279
Later

1015
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,480
I'll take you to see

1016
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,199
my attending doctor.

1017
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,920
We can go for

1018
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,960
a check-up together.

1019
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,600
No need.

1020
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,759
Your hospital is far and expensive.

1021
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:45,199
I can just find

1022
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,679
a public hospital nearby.

1023
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:47,480
It's fine.

1024
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,400
I have plenty of money in my medical card.

1025
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,239
I'll come pick you up later.

1026
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,279
You can leave me

1027
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,480
those maternity clothes.

1028
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,080
Sure.

1029
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:57,880
I'll buy you new ones.

1030
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,120
Are you

1031
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,920
trying to copy me?

1032
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Trying to follow in my footsteps?

1033
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,239
Actually,

1034
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm following your footsteps.

1035
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,080
When we were kids,

1036
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,000
I was always

1037
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,159
chasing after you,

1038
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,679
wearing your

1039
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,040
hand-me-downs.

1040
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,679
Now I will revenge.

1041
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm not buying you maternity clothes,

1042
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,279
you can wear my old ones.

1043
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,359
Alright.

1044
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,400
What else do you have left?

1045
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,400
Leave everything to me.

1046
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,839
Coming!

1047
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,759
Coming.

1048
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:34,600
Look.

1049
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,239
These grapes today

1050
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:39,880
are big and round.

1051
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,839
If pregnant women eat grapes,

1052
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,199
their babies will be fair-skinned.

1053
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,199
Is Haowen the one cooking?

1054
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:04,120
Yes, he'll prepare a pregnancy breakfast.

1055
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,679
A pregnancy breakfast?

1056
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,920
It should be rich and varied.

1057
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,400
Yes.

1058
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,120
Let him do it.

1059
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,319
Li Lin.

1060
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:12,480
Aren't you going to help?

1061
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:15,759
I'll go help.

1062
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,560
I'll learn from it.

1063
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,239
Today is my visiting time, right?

1064
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm in the basement.

1065
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,279
Send the kids down to me.

1066
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:36,480
Lv,

1067
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,279
I'll take a quick nap.

1068
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:39,440
I drank too much last night.

1069
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,279
Wake me up when the kids come down.

1070
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,520
Okay, Mr. Yu.

1071
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:46,639
Sister,

1072
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,319
last time you brought the toys,

1073
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,960
can you let me bring it this time?

1074
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:51,359
No, I want to bring this one.

1075
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,880
Last time, you already brought it.

1076
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,279
You can't bring this one today.

1077
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:56,199
I'm tired of it already.

1078
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,080
I must play with this one.

1079
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,159
I haven't gotten tired of this one.

1080
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
I want to bring this one.

1081
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,400
I must play with this one.

1082
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,239
I'm not tired of it yet.

1083
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,040
I want to play with this one.

1084
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,920
Alright, alright.

1085
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,520
Stop arguing.

1086
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:06,560
Put the toys down.

1087
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,960
Let's go downstairs.

1088
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,120
You've just recovered from illness.

1089
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Don't eat just anything.

1090
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,520
Be good at grandpa's house.

1091
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:13,159
Time to go.

1092
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,520
Let's go.

1093
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,040
Hi, Ms. Chen.

1094
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:26,159
Hello, Dr. Yu.

1095
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,880
Hi, Dr. Yu.

1096
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,839
Hello, Dr. Yu.

1097
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,920
How are you two princesses feeling?

1098
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,400
Any better?

1099
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,880
Much better.

1100
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,199
Mr. Yu.

1101
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,920
The kids has come downstairs.

1102
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,679
Hurry.

1103
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,719
Come closer.

1104
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:37,880
See you then.

1105
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,279
Don't keep Grandpa waiting.

1106
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:38,960
Put on your backpacks.

1107
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,440
Okay.

1108
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,719
Okay.

1109
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:39,920
Here.

1110
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,679
Don't eat too many cold things.

1111
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,920
Be good.

1112
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,600
Okay.

1113
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,639
Daddy's here.

1114
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I missed you so much.

1115
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,359
Daddy bought new clothes for you.

1116
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,000
Can't give them to you now.

1117
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,159
You'll get them

1118
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,639
after washing.

1119
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,359
Say goodbye to mommy.

1120
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,400
Goodbye, Mommy.

1121
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,199
Goodbye, Dr. Yu.

1122
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:57,799
Goodbye.

1123
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:58,759
Bye.

1124
00:40:58,759 --> 00:40:59,799
Fasten your seat belts.

1125
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:01,159
Let's go.

1126
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,040
Close the door.

1127
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,199
What's wrong? Feeling unwell?

1128
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:05,880
It's fine.

1129
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,359
Just an old problem.

1130
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,759
Low blood sugar.

1131
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,239
Luckily, I bought a box of chocolates.

1132
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,759
Quick, eat one.

1133
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,000
Thank you.

1134
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,679
Giving chocolates?

1135
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,199
Keep them all.

1136
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,279
Just in case.

1137
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,120
The kids are gone.

1138
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Hurry up and rest upstairs.

1139
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,000
This is ginseng.

1140
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,920
I didn't know until I saw it.

1141
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,239
Quite a shock.

1142
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,440
Jia Haowen really

1143
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,679
brings us a lot of things.

1144
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,880
When does he ever come empty-handed?

1145
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,920
And there's more.

1146
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,080
That's enough.

1147
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,159
You need to leave some.

1148
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,880
What will the kids eat when they're back?

1149
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,159
Right, soft-shelled turtles.

1150
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,239
Take out the turtles.

1151
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
I got an idea.

1152
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:17,159
You know,

1153
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,319
Xin is pregnant

1154
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,440
with one child.

1155
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,159
An is pregnant with one child.

1156
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,080
Could

1157
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,120
the baby in An's womb

1158
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,560
take the surname Xu?

1159
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:27,960
Come over.

1160
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,679
42 degrees.

1161
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:35,679
It's popular now,

1162
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,520
two good families

1163
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,560
merging into one.

1164
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,600
Each child takes one of their parents' surnames.

1165
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,600
Would Li Lin agree to this?

1166
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,159
This...

1167
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,639
Well,

1168
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:47,960
that's just what Li Lin's family does.

1169
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,960
Do you remember

1170
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,319
his eldest brother-in-law?

1171
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:52,120
Doesn't he have the surname Ouyang?

1172
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,159
He named his child Huahua,

1173
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,799
Huahua's surname is Li.

1174
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,159
Yes.

1175
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,040
The child of Ouyang

1176
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,199
can't even take the surname Ouyang,

1177
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,080
just because Lin's sister insisted

1178
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,679
the child take their family's surname, Li.

1179
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,759
Do you think she

1180
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,679
would agree

1181
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:10,679
to their child

1182
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,759
taking the surname Xu?

1183
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:13,759
His eldest sister

1184
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,000
would be furious.

1185
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,239
Don't even think about it.

1186
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,520
I think

1187
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:19,120
Li Lin might agree.

1188
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,560
He is reasonable.

1189
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,560
Is his eldest sister

1190
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,319
reasonable?

1191
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:24,159
That's enough.

1192
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,679
We can give it a try.

1193
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,679
Trying won't work.

1194
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:28,799
Turtles, my precious,

1195
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,520
reveal yourself now.

1196
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,120
Who's calling me?

1197
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,319
My dad, it turns out.

1198
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,719
Missing me that much?

1199
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:37,679
Welcome back.

1200
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,880
I'm looking for the turtles actually.

1201
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,600
Take a rest,

1202
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,520
I'll catch them.

1203
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,480
Leave it to him.

1204
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,199
Come on.

1205
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:43,000
Leave it to me.

1206
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,839
Is there any?

1207
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,799
Haowen,

1208
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:47,000
Why did you buy so many things again?

1209
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,120
What are you doing?

1210
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:50,960
There's no need to rush.

1211
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,000
Won't miss.

1212
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:52,920
I'll look for it.

1213
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,199
Chat with your daughter.

1214
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:54,639
Where are the turtles?

1215
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:55,279
Xin,

1216
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:56,480
Mom.

1217
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,040
How are you?

1218
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,199
I'm doing well.

1219
00:43:58,199 --> 00:43:59,319
Why these items

1220
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:00,159
look a bit

1221
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:02,000
familiar?

1222
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,080
Aren't these items you and Haowen

1223
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,960
brought back?

1224
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:04,880
Indeed.

1225
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:07,960
No.

1226
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,279
Keep it, Dad.

1227
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,319
We are families, there's no need.

1228
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,400
Just keep it.
