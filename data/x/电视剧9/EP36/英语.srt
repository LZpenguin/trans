3
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,430
I just received the notification.

4
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,120
The company account will be up

5
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
and running normally next week.

6
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,190
I've got everything

7
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,120
for the relaunch sorted out,

8
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,430
so there shouldn't be any issues.

9
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,830
Meng'an.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,710
I really owe it to you

11
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,880
for keeping Xinmiao running.

12
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,040
Thanks.

13
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,590
Let's skip the formalities between us.

14
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,310
It's been tough for years,

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,830
but we've made it through each challenge.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,990
The company's survived,

17
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,800
but it's definitely taken a hit.

18
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
They say fortune changes,

19
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,200
and that old saying really holds true.

20
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,590
Look at the investments now.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,640
They're all pouring into Blue Ocean.

22
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,800
We've had investors

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,590
pull out?

24
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,240
But I hear Blue Ocean

25
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,830
is backed by Yaohui Co.

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,590
Blue Ocean excels in operations,

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,870
while we've been strong in content.

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,030
Anyway, it's not the end of the world.

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,030
We'll push forward and compete.

30
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,870
Head-to-head.

31
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,430
I'm afraid I have no strength now.

32
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,550
How?

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,480
We've been working together for so long.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
I'll tell you the truth.

35
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,960
I've been thinking

36
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,960
about quitting.

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,270
Quitting?

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,150
But why?

39
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,680
No particular reason.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,360
It's the board's decision.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,550
They want to sell the company.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,080
But you're the founder.

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,830
How can they ask you to leave?

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,990
They want to sell off the company?

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,870
Being a founder

46
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,200
doesn't mean much here.

47
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,920
It's all about what the capital wants.

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
If they want to sell, then they sell.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,150
Who are we to say no?

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,550
But it might not be so bad.

51
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,240
See,

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,480
you're on maternity leave.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,480
Now you can take the time to relax.

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,310
Honestly,

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,550
I'm not up for continuing anymore.

56
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,400
Just stand by me

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,640
for the last duty.

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,520
Mr Yu.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,830
Wanzhen.

60
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,990
No, no, no...

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,750
Wendy.

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,510
Got a minute?

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,550
I'm always available for you.

64
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,190
Have a seat.

65
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,630
About the acquisition of Xinmiao,

66
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,160
what are your thoughts?

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,190
Well,

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm thinking of acquiring Xinmiao first,

69
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,750
then bringing you in

70
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,550
as the investor's representative

71
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,120
to join Blue Ocean.

72
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
Then you, me,

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,190
and Meng'an

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,510
could team up at Blue Ocean

75
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,870
and do something big.

76
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,280
Are you sure about this?

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,160
Mr Zhou is very supportive.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
I think it's a solid plan.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,240
Indeed, for our investment,

80
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,480
two leading platforms

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,800
joining forces

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,280
to create a regional unicorn

83
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,840
is really a great move.

84
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,550
Exactly,

85
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,870
it's definitely a win-win situation.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,920
Our company is fine

87
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,070
and we won't lose, of course.

88
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,720
But what about you?

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,600
I...

90
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,720
If you sign the bet-on agreement,

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,190
it will be a double-edged sword.

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,480
But if I

93
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,870
do not sign this agreement,

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,310
Mr Zhou

95
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,310
and the other investors

96
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,240
won't support me anymore

97
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,190
or provide additional funding.

98
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,240
Our investment terms are strict.

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,950
What if you lose

100
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
after signing this deal?

101
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,310
Are you caring about me personally?

102
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,800
I care about you only because

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,280
you know Blue Ocean too well.

104
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,950
Blue Ocean

105
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,280
is your brainchild.

106
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
It's all of your work

107
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,480
for the past decade.

108
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,550
If this acquisition

109
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,160
means your loss of control

110
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
or even being pushed out of Blue Ocean,

111
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,310
won't you regret it?

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,950
You're worried about me.

113
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,800
I...

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
You're our kid's father.

115
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
I have reason to be concerned.

116
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,870
Wanzhen, actually,

117
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,920
I've thought

118
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,040
about this a lot already.

119
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,550
It's basically two choices:

120
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,920
either let Blue Ocean grow

121
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,840
or maintain my personal control

122
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,550
over the company.

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,630
So what's your choice?

124
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,040
I choose

125
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,990
to let Blue Ocean grow.

126
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,840
You know investment.

127
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,070
I know the Internet.

128
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,990
Over the past decade,

129
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,600
Blue Ocean and I

130
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,120
have been facing

131
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,040
these kinds of challenges and choices.

132
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,630
This time,

133
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,950
I need your investment.

134
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,360
If I miss

135
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,600
such a great opportunity,

136
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,390
Blue Ocean could stagnate.

137
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,800
Or even worse,

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,390
it could face collapse

139
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,990
with no way out.

140
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,430
Since I'm seeking your investment,

141
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,550
I have to take this risk.

142
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,600
Alright.

143
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,040
if you're set on it,

144
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,720
let's proceed as planned.

145
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,280
About what I told you today,

146
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,870
I won't repeat it again.

147
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,680
I know.

148
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,630
You're always like this.

149
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,990
Just like with our divorce, right?

150
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,950
You're getting off track.

151
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Wanzhen,

152
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,840
don't you think my current situation

153
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,430
is perfect

154
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,840
for signing this agreement?

155
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,280
What do you mean?

156
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,950
I'm on my own now.

157
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,600
You and the kid are gone,

158
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,280
but we left enough education funds

159
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,680
for our kid.

160
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,720
If you were

161
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,990
still around,

162
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,630
I'd hesitate and hold back.

163
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,190
I'd never have the guts to fight

164
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,630
with my back against the wall like this.

165
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
If Xinmiao is sold,

166
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,750
I'll have to leave.

167
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm the former boss's

168
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,190
chosen HR director.

169
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,310
I can by no means stay.

170
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,990
Same here.

171
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,430
New ruler, new officials.

172
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
Employees like us,

173
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,630
with high salaries,

174
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,800
not very obedient,

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,990
and occasionally tripping up the boss,

176
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,750
certainly have to go.

177
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,800
But you may stay.

178
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,800
Why?

179
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,630
You're the content director,

180
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,040
the core of the company.

181
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,040
Who else could take on Xinmiao

182
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,990
besides Blue Ocean?

183
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,750
Well, Mr Yu

184
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,190
has been trying to poach you, hasn't he?

185
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,800
Could be someone else.

186
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,720
Have a bet?

187
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,600
Better not.

188
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,950
If it's someone else,

189
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,160
I might still have a chance.

190
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,550
But if it's Yu Hai,

191
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,630
I'd really be out.

192
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,870
Why?

193
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,360
We are friends after all.

194
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,680
Look at me right now.

195
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,560
I still need maternity leave.

196
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,870
I can't occupy this position

197
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,200
without contributing.

198
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,960
That would be awkward even with friends.

199
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,960
Anyway, they can't fire you,

200
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,270
you're pregnant.

201
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,790
That's your lifeline.

202
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,960
Any plans?

203
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,750
I'm thinking of

204
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,120
taking a 20-year annual leave,

205
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,200
traveling the world,

206
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,790
and maybe meeting a prince charming.

207
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,510
It'd be prefect

208
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,630
if I meet someone like Li Lin.

209
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,240
Or you can just give me

210
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
a photo of Li Lin,

211
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
and I'll carry it with me.

212
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,390
Think it'll work?

213
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:16,870
Come on.

214
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,360
He's no mascot.

215
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,910
What about you?

216
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,600
Any plans?

217
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,480
What's the use of my plans right now?

218
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,510
I'll just focus

219
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
on giving birth first.

220
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,390
Then you should stay home for now.

221
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,480
When I'm back in charge,

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,030
we'll achieve greatness again.

223
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,790
Okay.

224
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,960
Aren't you even a little bit disappointed?

225
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,240
How could I not be?

226
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,390
There she is.

227
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,120
Meng'an.

228
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,790
Honey!

229
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Hello, Meng'an.

230
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,870
Yiduo.

231
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,910
How did you get here? Took a cab?

232
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,600
Are you alright?

233
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,320
Yes.

234
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,790
Long time no see.

235
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,870
Yes, it's been a while.

236
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,120
I've been wanting to visit you

237
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,510
but never had the chance.

238
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,670
I'm glad you're here today.

239
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,750
You look great,

240
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,150
and the scarf suits you.

241
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
That's sweet of you.

242
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
He's impressive,

243
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,870
balancing work and life so well.

244
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
Yunjie loves the chocolates

245
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
you sent her.

246
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
Have you thanked Yiduo?

247
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,870
I did,

248
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,960
when I got them.

249
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,990
Yes, he thanked me.

250
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,670
How long are you staying this time?

251
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,480
Do you have time

252
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,080
for a meal at my place?

253
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm not sure about

254
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,910
how long I'll stay yet,

255
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,990
but a meal at your place

256
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,960
sounds good.

257
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,790
Li Lin

258
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,200
has never invited me.

259
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,750
It's okay.

260
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,630
Don't worry about him.

261
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm inviting you.

262
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,600
Great.

263
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,790
Boss.

264
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,240
Where are we going so urgently?

265
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,870
You didn't even tell me.

266
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,990
I've still got a ton of work left to do.

267
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,120
The boss is taking an employee out

268
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,360
for a work event.

269
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,030
Does he need to report to the employee?

270
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,560
As long as the boss's plans are good.

271
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,560
I was planning to give you a surprise.

272
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
What did you mean?

273
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,750
Another surprise?

274
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,720
You...

275
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,990
you'd be better off giving me

276
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,270
something real instead.

277
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,240
Chen Wanzhen,

278
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,790
why have you turned

279
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,960
into this kind of person?

280
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,200
Here's your gift.

281
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,790
A VIP invitation to the investor summit.

282
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,910
For me?

283
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,200
Thanks, boss.

284
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,790
No problem.

285
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,910
Does this count as a surprise?

286
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,200
But I'm afraid

287
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,270
I'm not really qualified for this.

288
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,360
As long as

289
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,510
your reference is qualified.

290
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,080
There's a forum

291
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
at the summit that I need to attend.

292
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,560
As for you,

293
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,870
you'll be carrying my bag

294
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,480
and getting a good look around.

295
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,320
Sure, I'll take good care of your bag.

296
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,360
Why did you suddenly

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,870
find time to see me today?

298
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,790
Just wanted to take a walk with you.

299
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,390
Take a walk?

300
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,440
There's nothing else going on?

301
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,150
You figured it out.

302
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,720
I'm not blind.

303
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,910
Xinmiao

304
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,120
is being sold.

305
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,030
Sold?

306
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,560
Why?

307
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,480
The industry is already in a downturn,

308
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,960
and with the mess

309
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,510
Huang Sisi caused,

310
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,910
Zhang is probably taking the blame.

311
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,630
He told me today

312
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,360
that the board wants him out.

313
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,080
It looks more like

314
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,120
he's resigning in disgrace.

315
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,910
Why so suddenly?

316
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,990
With Zhang gone, what happens to you?

317
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,030
We'll just manage through the transition.

318
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,990
But Rachel and I,

319
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,600
we won't be staying for sure.

320
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,870
Let's not worry about that for now.

321
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,150
We should focus

322
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,510
on getting the baby born.

323
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,510
I'll be here with you.

324
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,200
Now it's my turn to be unemployed.

325
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,320
That makes me feel better.

326
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,630
We're leaving now.

327
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,240
Honey,

328
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,750
the small stuff is done.

329
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,200
It'd be a shame not to take the big stuff.

330
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,600
What's the shame?

331
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,960
It was customized for the villa.

332
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,080
Now that we're moving,

333
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,560
where will it even fit?

334
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,320
Just leave it for the next owner.

335
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,630
Alright,

336
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,240
you're my boss.

337
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,960
No, no, no.

338
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
Don't say that.

339
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,670
You followed my advice too closely.

340
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,120
And now we've lost this home.

341
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,600
Talk about this house,

342
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,990
how long have we actually lived here?

343
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,990
Why do we have to move?

344
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,150
Honey.

345
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,710
Don't.

346
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,150
I'm just saying.

347
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,800
Don't take it to heart.

348
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,190
It's my fault.

349
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,000
I shouldn't have clung to you,

350
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,280
making you stay home

351
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,520
with me everyday

352
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,670
and neglect your work.

353
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,870
It's all my fault.

354
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,800
No, my fault.

355
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,230
Honey, it's my fault.

356
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,870
Honey.

357
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,520
Honey.

358
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,800
You know what?

359
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
When you said wanting a divorce from me,

360
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,080
and talked about selling this house,

361
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,320
I was furious.

362
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,470
In a moment of anger,

363
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,120
I thought,

364
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,710
fine, if you want a divorce, so be it.

365
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,230
I'll just have my parents

366
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,150
move in with me.

367
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,670
It'll be better than the old house.

368
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,910
But then I thought,

369
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,840
what's so good about this house?

370
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
When we moved in,

371
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,470
all this trouble started.

372
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,320
First, Haoze's mom divorced.

373
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,390
Then...

374
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,710
then I hired someone to check on you.

375
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,520
It's all been a mess,

376
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,080
leading to this situation.

377
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,630
So, this house

378
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,760
isn't worth it at all.

379
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,190
Honey,

380
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,710
I'll move back sooner or later.

381
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,080
Why would you move back?

382
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,520
Are you out of your mind?

383
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm telling you,

384
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,800
even if we have money,

385
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,760
we're not moving back.

386
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,520
This house is nothing

387
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,760
but a headache.

388
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
I've made you suffer.

389
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,470
As if I never suffered with you.

390
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,150
Didn't we go through tough times together?

391
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,520
You're like my sister,

392
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,760
saying I can't handle hardship.

393
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,760
Well, I showed her that I can.

394
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,710
Get in the car.

395
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,760
Come on, Jia Haowen

396
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Coming, sweetheart.

397
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,910
I'm coming.

398
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,080
Let's go.

399
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,120
Don't rush.

400
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,870
Look at all your sweat.

401
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,560
They'll be here soon.

402
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,760
I forgot to bring tissues again.

403
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,150
The vegetables today are very fresh.

404
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,630
Yes, they are.

405
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,150
We have plenty of meat at home.

406
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,670
Really?

407
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,470
Xu,

408
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,040
why are you two just standing here?

409
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,000
Waiting for my youngest daughter.

410
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,560
She's coming back to move back in

411
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,630
with our son-in-law.

412
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,470
I thought your youngest daughter

413
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,840
was living in a big villa.

414
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,150
Why are they moving back?

415
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,710
Look, Xu got sick.

416
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,800
They insist on

417
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,120
moving back to take care of him.

418
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,470
I tried to stop them, but they ignored me.

419
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
You don't know how lucky you are.

420
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,430
Look how filial these two kids are.

421
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,390
Exactly.

422
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,800
See you later.

423
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,000
Alright, bye.

424
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,710
Bye.

425
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,390
They're really lucky, those two.

426
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes, they are.

427
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,910
We're not so fortunate.

428
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,870
No, we're not.

429
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,670
Has the car turned in yet?

430
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,910
I haven't seen it.

431
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,560
Xin said it has.

432
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,760
It has turned in.

433
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,840
Here they are!

434
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,430
Here they are!

435
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,630
I saw them.

436
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,120
Jia Haowen, play it cool.

437
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,950
No tears,

438
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,230
got it?

439
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,190
Why are you out here?

440
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,520
Waiting for you.

441
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,800
Here.

442
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,230
Come.

443
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,520
Dad.

444
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,430
Mom.

445
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,150
Welcome

446
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,800
home.

447
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,390
Dad.

448
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,670
Dad.

449
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
Dad's here.

450
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Dad.

451
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,190
It's good you're back.

452
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
Come on, come.

453
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,870
Let's go home.

454
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,430
That's good.

455
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,560
As long as you're back.

456
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,520
As long as you're back.

457
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,840
Help your auntie move stuff.

458
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,230
Let's go.

459
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,670
Okay.

460
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,080
Sister.

461
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,320
Mom.

462
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,840
Good thing you're back.

463
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,390
You're back.

464
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,870
That's good.

465
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,230
Don't cry.

466
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,950
Have some corn.

467
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,910
Daddy's back.

468
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,190
Have some corn with your daddy,

469
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,080
okay?

470
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,000
What's this?

471
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,000
That's cabbage.

472
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,950
Cabbage.

473
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
They'll be back soon.

474
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,430
Your daddy and mommy

475
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,760
will be back soon.

476
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,150
Come on, look

477
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,280
They're back.

478
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,600
Haowen, hurry up.

479
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,470
Hurry up and come here.

480
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,280
Give me a hand.

481
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,150
I'm all hands on deck here.

482
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm babysitting your kid.

483
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,150
Mind your own kid.

484
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,560
Come on, your daddy's back.

485
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,630
Daddy's back.

486
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,910
Love you.

487
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,600
Daddy.

488
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,430
Dad.

489
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,190
Daddy.

490
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,230
Daddy, I missed you

491
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,430
Missed daddy, huh?

492
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,710
Sweetheart.

493
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,950
Love you.

494
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,040
Little Watermelon.

495
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,560
Haowen's not feeling well.

496
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,280
That's normal.

497
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,630
He wouldn't have come back with me

498
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,120
unless it was absolutely necessary.

499
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,630
Does his mom

500
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,950
know about this?

501
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,320
I didn't tell Haowen to inform her.

502
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,000
She's getting up there in age.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,190
I don't want to stress her out.

504
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,840
But you can't keep it hidden forever.

505
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,390
We'll keep it secret as long as possible.

506
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,190
What are you planning to do?

507
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,910
I'm going to look for a job.

508
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,910
At least get something to do.

509
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,760
Haowen

510
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,670
has taken on so much before.

511
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,630
I want him to have some rest

512
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,910
at home for now.

513
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,320
You want to go back to work?

514
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,360
I support you.

515
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,910
What kind of job are you looking for?

516
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,470
I can ask around for you.

517
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm not sure yet,

518
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,230
but I have an old classmate

519
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,670
who runs an art institute.

520
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,760
I think

521
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,910
it's related to my background

522
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,120
in fashion design.

523
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,150
I'll check it out

524
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,320
and see.

525
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,280
Okay.

526
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,150
Xin,

527
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,840
there's something

528
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,230
I want to remind you about.

529
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,950
Every family has its own challenges

530
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,870
and ways

531
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,910
of handling things,

532
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,800
but there's one thing

533
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,520
that's pretty universal:

534
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,390
at times like these, you need to be

535
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,190
especially considerate of his feelings.

536
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,870
Everything

537
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,000
should be discussed together.

538
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,190
It's not the time to show your capability.

539
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,670
but about giving each other

540
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,600
more respect

541
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,950
and trust.

542
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Got it?

543
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,320
You're both still young,

544
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,080
and things will work out.

545
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,230
Come here. Let me hug you.

546
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,630
The beef is ready.

547
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,430
Dear, hurry up and eat

548
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,000
before it's all gone.

549
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,560
What do you want to eat?

550
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,320
I'll get it for you.

551
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,630
Did you hear? Don't get it yourself.

552
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,670
Xiongxiong, come on.

553
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,280
Come, Yunjie.

554
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,040
Come on.

555
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,470
He doesn't like spicy food.

556
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:23,910
Yunjie, Yunjie,

557
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,320
Hurry up.

558
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,360
Mom, Mom.

559
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,390
Here you go. This is yours.

560
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,470
Everything's ready.

561
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,320
Let's have a toast.

562
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,600
Let's do it.

563
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:30,950
Okay?

564
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Dad, Mom.

565
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,760
I hope you stay healthy.

566
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,360
This way, Mr Zhou.

567
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,560
Thank you.

568
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,870
Mr Zhou, please take a look here.

569
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,150
Mr Zhou,

570
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,560
what are your criteria

571
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,670
for investing in a project?

572
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,710
Yes, Mr Zhou.

573
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,430
There are many criteria.

574
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,800
But a project

575
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,600
that meets all the criteria

576
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,870
isn't necessarily a good one.

577
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,710
The key is to find something

578
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,040
that really resonates with you.

579
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,000
That's the core and soul

580
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
of the project.

581
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,670
You must be Wendy?

582
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,150
Yes.

583
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,430
I'm Wendy Chen from Yaohui Co.

584
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,870
Here's my business card.

585
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,390
Chen Wanzhen.

586
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,430
I know you.

587
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,470
You're quite famous.

588
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,000
You're flattering me.

589
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,560
Well,

590
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,120
today I finally see

591
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,000
what the goddess

592
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,280
that Zhou Yao has admired

593
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,600
for ten years looks like.

594
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,390
I hope I didn't disappoint you.

595
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,360
Wendy.

596
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,230
But I must say,

597
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,600
you're really gorgeous.

598
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,800
Thanks.

599
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,600
Wendy.

600
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,280
I've been waiting for you.

601
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,760
Mr Zhou.

602
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:50,840
Here, give me the bag.

603
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,470
I'll hold it for you.

604
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,280
No, no, it's fine.

605
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Just cooperate, please.

606
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,190
What romantic debt have you gotten into?

607
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,470
Romantic debt?

608
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,710
An admirer.

609
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,910
Wendy,

610
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,430
there's still some time

611
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,190
before the forum starts.

612
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,910
How about we

613
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,080
take a walk on the lawn

614
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,230
and get some fresh air?

615
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,080
No, no,

616
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,560
I still have a report to finish.

617
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,870
We're already here, so let's go.

618
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,280
I really can't.

619
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,150
Work comes first.

620
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:13,760
Wendy.

621
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,120
Mr Zhou.

622
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,360
I didn't expect

623
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,120
you'd like this style.

624
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,800
Good taste.

625
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,910
She's quite beautiful.

626
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,190
What did you talk about with her?

627
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,230
Not much.

628
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,950
But it seems like your goddess

629
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,760
isn't too fond of you.

630
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,910
What goddess?

631
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,710
Mr Zhou,

632
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,630
what did that woman

633
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,390
say to you?

634
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,320
Boss,

635
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,280
I'll cover for you,

636
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,080
but remember,

637
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,360
we're just

638
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,040
employee and boss,

639
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,710
right?

640
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,520
So, what kind of relationship

641
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:02,910
do you think

642
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,190
we should have?

643
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,950
Let's keep it simple.

644
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,230
She's the one.

645
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,760
The famous Wendy

646
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,430
I heard

647
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,520
she's Zhou Yao's goddess

648
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,800
for ten years.

649
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Work is work,

650
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,800
but I don't want to mix work

651
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,390
with personal life.

652
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,950
I get it.

653
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,670
You want to prove yourself

654
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,600
through work,

655
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,800
not have

656
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,430
your personal life

657
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,390
gossiped about.

658
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,520
Exactly.

659
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,190
Well, it might be a bit late for that.

660
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,280
Chen Wanzhen.

661
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,710
Don't joke around.

662
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,390
No, don't go. I haven't finished talking.

663
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,800
Chen Wanzhen!

664
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,710
Chen Wanzhen!

665
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,560
Do you want to be a partner?

666
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,870
Here's the partner badge.

667
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,630
Starting tomorrow,

668
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,230
we're not just

669
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,710
boss and employee anymore.

670
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,000
I wanted to surprise you

671
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,600
and let everyone know

672
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
your new role,

673
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
but you ran off faster than a rabbit.

674
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
Why are you running away?

675
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,120
Sorry, sorry. I...

676
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,710
I thought...

677
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,000
-I thought...
-Thought what?

678
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
-I thought...
-You thought too much.

679
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,360
-Take it?
-I'm not...

680
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,760
So, what now?

681
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,950
Do I need to beg?

682
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,710
Please, please, don't!

683
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,190
No, no,

684
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,840
you, you really...

685
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,360
You really scared me.

686
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,080
If you wanted to promote me,

687
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,390
you could've just said so.

688
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,760
Why scare me like that?

689
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,080
I wasn't trying to scare you.

690
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,390
I was scaring them.

691
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,000
I get it.

692
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,600
You used me as a tool.

693
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,520
What do you mean, used you?

694
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,710
It was a win-win,

695
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,320
wasn't it?

696
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
I surprised you

697
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,670
to make you happy,

698
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,670
and scared her off

699
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,630
to let her go.

700
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,120
Isn't that

701
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,230
a brilliant move?

702
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,080
Thanks, Zhou Yao.

703
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,910
You deserve it.

704
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,000
Stop just drinking porridge.

705
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,190
Eat the egg too.

706
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,840
Slow down,

707
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,470
don't choke.

708
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,840
Xin,

709
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,950
why isn't Haowen having breakfast again?

710
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,470
He's not hungry, let him be.

711
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,430
How can he not be hungry?

712
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,520
Here, take him some food.

713
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,360
He's a grown-up now.

714
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,040
Just leave him.

715
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,910
I'm going grab my stuff.

716
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,600
Xu.

717
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,390
Since Haowen

718
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,910
came back,

719
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,870
he's been so quiet,

720
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,390
just staying in his room all day.

721
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,870
Maybe you should talk to him

722
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,430
or take him out for a bit?

723
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,000
Auntie.

724
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,120
I think my cousin-in-law

725
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
is really good with Little Watermelon.

726
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,000
I've never seen a man

727
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,880
who takes care of babies so well.

728
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,310
I heard

729
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,790
there are many men now

730
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,630
who stay at home with kids,

731
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,310
called stay-at-home dads.

732
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,190
No, Lanxiang,

733
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,520
Haowen

734
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,440
can't be a stay-at-home dad.

735
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
He's too capable for earning money.

736
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,600
He can't just stay home;

737
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,310
he'd get used to a lazy life.

738
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,750
That's true.

739
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,600
See...

740
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,270
No, no, no.

741
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
So what should we do?

742
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,310
Think of something.

743
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,790
The short video you showed me

744
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,000
is quite motivational, isn't it?

745
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,440
Send him.

746
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,000
Okay, okay.

747
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,440
I'll send it to the group chat,

748
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,630
not just to him directly.

749
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,230
He might have overthought.

750
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,790
Done.

751
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,040
The hand's getting steadier, huh?

752
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,520
Let me show you.

753
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,630
Good.

754
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,190
What are you doing?

755
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,270
What's the matter?

756
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,830
What's all this random stuff

757
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,480
you posted

758
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,670
in the family chat group?

759
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,440
What's wrong with it?

760
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,710
How would Haowen think?

761
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,190
I just wanted to

762
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,830
encourage him.

763
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,630
You don't know.

764
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,750
When you're not around,

765
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,880
he doesn't even leave the house

766
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,120
or talk to anyone.

767
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,310
It's really scary.

768
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,480
So

769
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,830
you're just checking up on him,

770
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,630
by bringing him food and drinks.

771
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,630
I knew it.

772
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,600
When I was studying,

773
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,630
and doing my homework

774
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,480
you'd come in

775
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,080
every few minutes

776
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,150
asking what's for lunch

777
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,830
or dinner.

778
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,920
It was annoying.

779
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,630
You're putting pressure on him

780
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,830
with all this attention.

781
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,670
I didn't mean to pressure him.

782
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,350
Over-caring becomes pressure.

783
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,790
Now It's my fault for caring about him.

784
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,600
Here you go again.

785
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,710
I didn't say it's your fault.

786
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,960
It's not.

787
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,270
Just let him

788
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,520
be alone

789
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,830
in the room

790
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,040
to think about

791
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,920
what he wants to do next.

792
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
If he wants food or drink,

793
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,880
he'll come out.

794
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,270
Don't disturb him.

795
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,960
Is that okay?

796
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,150
Okay.

797
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,600
Okay. I'll go now.

798
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,480
By the way,

799
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:24,960
well,

800
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,830
if my mother-in-law calls,

801
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,080
don't tell her anything.

802
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,750
Just say

803
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,670
everything's fine.

804
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,630
Everything's fine.

805
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,480
Don't forget it.

806
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,750
Your wife

807
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,920
almost slipped up last time.

808
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Keep an eye on her.

809
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,920
I'm leaving now.

810
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,310
Xiongxiong, hurry up.

811
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,520
Xiongxiong, hurry up!

812
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,960
I still think

813
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,310
you should talk to him.

814
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,960
Your hands are getting good.

815
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,150
Come on.

816
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,440
Let's try this.

817
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,560
You did it the wrong way.

818
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,120
Yiduo.

819
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,270
No rush.

820
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,400
You can think it over some more.

821
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,080
Li Lin,

822
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,040
I can responsibly say that

823
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,480
this plan

824
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,480
is one of the most complete

825
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,880
in the country.

826
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,830
So you're

827
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,040
the best choice for me to partner with.

828
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,230
But doesn't Mr Ma

829
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,230
want to work with you too?

830
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,630
You can partner with him.

831
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,560
Ma isn't suitable.

832
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,790
He's just like me,

833
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,670
stuck in an ivory tower.

834
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,630
What I need

835
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,270
is a practical partner

836
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,270
with market experience like you.

837
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,710
I think you should work

838
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,440
with Mr Ma.

839
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,350
I...

840
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,190
I really can't go to Beijing.

841
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,790
Why not?

842
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,830
Meng'an doesn't let you go?

843
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,400
Let me be honest with you.

844
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,440
Meng'an is of advanced maternal age.

845
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,120
In three months,

846
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,310
the baby will be born.

847
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,350
When our first child was born,

848
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,120
I had just graduated from grad school,

849
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,230
so I was busy with work.

850
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,190
Meng'an basically took care of everything

851
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,670
until the child was three years old.

852
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,520
Now, with the second baby coming,

853
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,480
I

854
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,000
don't want to miss out again.

855
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,480
This time I'm back in the country

856
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,920
to set up a large lab,

857
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,630
which is a big opportunity for me,

858
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,310
and for you too.

859
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,400
At our age,

860
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,120
there aren't

861
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
many chances left for career advancement.

862
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,960
Don't you want to

863
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,400
seize this one

864
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,400
and prove yourself?

865
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,790
What you're saying

866
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,310
is indeed tempting,

867
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,600
but, Yiduo,

868
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,520
I'm really sorry.

869
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,270
I just can't say yes.

870
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,440
There's nothing more important

871
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,270
than family.

872
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,440
Sorry.

873
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,560
This is appetizing.

874
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,190
See if he eats it. Go.

875
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Haowen being so closed off

876
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
isn't good.

877
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,080
He might end up sick from it.

878
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,630
I'm talking to you.

879
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,830
Haowen's not coming out.

880
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,440
What should we do?

881
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,000
Auntie,

882
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,040
look.

883
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,920
He hasn't eaten a bite.

884
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,600
Xu,

885
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,440
can't you do something?

886
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,190
Go talk to him.

887
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,190
I'll get some more water.

888
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,790
The bird in the cage

889
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,400
really wants to fly out, doesn't it?

890
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,630
Haowen.

891
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,830
Dad.

892
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,520
Come on. Let's get some fresh air.

893
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
I'm playing with the baby.

894
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,230
Come in.

895
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,190
Haowen.

896
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,880
Go out for a stroll with your Dad.

897
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,960
Lanxiang and I can handle the baby.

898
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,120
Dad,

899
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,630
I disappointed you.

900
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,230
But you've had your moments of glory.

901
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,230
Your mom and I

902
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,880
often talk about you.

903
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,880
We're really proud of the life

904
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,080
we're living now.

905
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,190
Honestly, Haowen,

906
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,190
you've played a huge part in that.

907
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,960
You've supported us financially,

908
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,880
giving us all you have,

909
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,190
without ever hiding.

910
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,350
Your brother-in-law

911
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,520
has been a great support emotionally.

912
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,630
You know,

913
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,000
our neighbors,

914
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,230
my friends

915
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,830
and fishing partners,

916
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,310
they all envy us.

917
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,480
You've heard the old saying:

918
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,230
a good daughter

919
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,520
means a good son-in-law.

920
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,630
Your mom and I

921
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,630
have always been proud of you,

922
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,000
never seeing you

923
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,560
as just a son-in-law

924
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,480
but as our own son.

925
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,270
They say a son-in-law is like half a son,

926
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,920
but to me,

927
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,670
half a son-in-law is like a whole son.

928
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,480
Don't blame yourself.

929
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,880
Business

930
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,670
has its ups and downs.

931
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,000
Even the best in business

932
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,560
also have to

933
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,830
experience losses, don't they?

934
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,600
I've heard from my fishing friends that

935
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,630
a true businessman

936
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,080
doesn't just make money,

937
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,000
he knows how to handle losses too.

938
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,230
Losing money is just part of the process

939
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,480
to make more in the long run.

940
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,960
I think

941
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,190
you've reached

942
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,920
a mature business mindset,

943
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,630
haven't you?

944
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,750
I've never been disappointed in you.

945
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,520
Every man has to

946
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,150
face some challenges

947
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,190
in his life.

948
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,790
Don't be hard on yourself.

949
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,040
No matter how much money

950
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,480
you make

951
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,040
or what position you hold,

952
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,790
in the end, what matters most

953
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,600
is family.
