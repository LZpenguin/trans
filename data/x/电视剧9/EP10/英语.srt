3
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,760
After you.

4
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,880
You are the creator.

5
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
You flattered me.

6
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,070
I saw you

7
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,040
eat instant noodles in your office.

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I was mouthwatering.

9
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
I've eaten too much good food.

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,350
I'd like to taste

11
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,550
the food I ate in the college dorm.

12
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,070
Come on!

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,830
It's okay.

14
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,600
Here comes mine.

15
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,270
Is it the same?

16
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,240
Indeed it is.

17
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,120
When you studied abroad,

18
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,320
did you eat instant noodles in the dorm?

19
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,800
Yeah, we were strapped

20
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
back that time.

21
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,960
It was a great treat

22
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,800
to get a bowl of instant noodles.

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,080
Yeah, right.

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,960
Would you like

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,590
a drink?

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,150
I'll pass, thanks.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,870
Actually,

28
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,990
I rarely drink.

29
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,030
Once I've finished this bowl of noodles,

30
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,750
I'll head upstairs to work.

31
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,270
Understood.

32
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,030
You're on your own now,

33
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,870
single

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,990
once more.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,830
Mr. Zhou,

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll

37
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,830
inform all investors

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,150
of my divorce.

39
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,680
It won't

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,030
cause shareholding changes

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,080
of our company.

42
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,480
It won't.

43
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,080
Being single has its advantages:

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,550
you'll have high work efficiency

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
and be well-suited for entrepreneurship.

46
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,270
We investors

47
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,150
favor startup founders

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,270
like you,

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,030
who cut off all means of retreat.

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,310
Agree.

51
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,360
Aside from

52
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,990
Blue Ocean,

53
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,150
there's nothing left to distract me.

54
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,550
But as I see,

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,750
those who just get divorced

56
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,430
or become single

57
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,310
are prone to

58
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,430
emotional instability,

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,680
especially the one being dumped.

60
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,270
They'll frequently

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,990
feel lonely

62
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,710
all of a sudden,

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,640
Or,

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,400
they'll have an emotional breakdown.

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Mr. Yu, do you have

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
this sort of feeling?

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,680
Nope.

68
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,120
Definitely not.

69
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,800
I think

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm a middle-aged man

71
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,480
with emotional stability.

72
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,430
Anyhow, I must offer you a word of caution:

73
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,400
refrain from drowning sorrows in alcohol,

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
and particularly from cozying up to strangers

75
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,680
at bars.

76
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah, right.

77
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,080
Otherwise, you'll find yourself in a rather awkward situation

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,430
when you sober up the next day.

79
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,030
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

80
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,710
I've got a lot of experience

81
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,240
in being single.

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,990
If anything bothers you,

83
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm all ears.

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
Thanks, I will.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,830
Let's eat noodles.

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,400
Okay.

87
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,800
Here he goes again.

88
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,480
Won't it stop?

89
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,190
I can't bear it a moment longer.

90
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,630
Why does your little brother keep crying?

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,280
That's enough,

92
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,630
I can't take it anymore.

93
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,190
I am leaving.

94
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,390
Wait, wait!

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,360
Stay with me a little longer.

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,550
I haven't finished my homework yet.

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,630
Please!

98
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,550
Stop it!

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,920
I'll talk to him.

100
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,070
Wait here for me.

101
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,840
I'll talk to him.

102
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,040
Stop crying!

103
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,240
Haowen,

104
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,280
this is the feast you mentioned?

105
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,360
Are you serious?

106
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,040
Lin,

107
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,720
I just don't wanna see you toil

108
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,430
in the stove at home.

109
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,240
You think we teachers

110
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,190
are easily fooled,

111
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,840
and that we has never enjoyed a feast?

112
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,040
Come on, it's so good to eat out.

113
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,510
Feel the air, the environment,

114
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,430
and the river gushing in the distance.

115
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,510
This place is popular

116
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,120
among the young.

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,840
It's great!

118
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
But still this has nothing to do with a feast.

119
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,840
I bet this place will be the new location

120
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,950
of a One-Michelin Starred restaurant

121
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,040
in the future.

122
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,070
Enough, you were bragging.

123
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,870
I know it.

124
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,680
Come on, Lin.

125
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,870
You're caring about me, aren't you?

126
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,070
I'll

127
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,190
make do with it.

128
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,430
Too bad there're so many dishes at home.

129
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,040
They'll

130
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,280
become leftovers tomorrow.

131
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,040
They won't go bad in the fridge.

132
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,550
Lin,

133
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,480
I got some tonic for Meng'an.

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,310
Mom said she has entered

135
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,040
menopause earlier than expected.

136
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,800
Yeah.

137
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,950
It's all right.

138
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,120
It's just a minor problem.

139
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
Minor problem?

140
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,190
That's a serious matter.

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
Premature menopause?

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,310
She is not that old

143
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,720
and even younger than me.

144
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,390
It's too bad!

145
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,600
She's to do body conditioning in time.

146
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,750
Listen, Lin,

147
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,120
I know lots of experienced doctors of TCM.

148
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,630
I'll recommend you some of them.

149
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,120
Seriously.

150
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
The sooner the better.

151
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,680
You know, Mr. Li is my business partner.

152
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,310
His wife is 47 years old,

153
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,430
yet with the same problem.

154
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,680
So she made efforts to do body conditioning.

155
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Guess what?

156
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,280
She gave birth to a second baby!

157
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,750
Isn't it amazing?

158
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,990
You're so excited that

159
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,990
that your chopsticks got dropped.

160
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,630
Of course, I'm excited.

161
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,630
You'd better try hard

162
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,840
to have a second child.

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm telling you,

164
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,800
if anyone should have a second child,

165
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,430
it's definitely you.

166
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,870
We are the same.

167
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
I love kids.

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,190
I like having a second child.

169
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,280
What's your opinion?

170
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,600
Don't you want a second child?

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,990
No need.

172
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
We cannot afford to have it.

173
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,840
You've got time and money.

174
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,160
You can just have a second child.

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,840
Lin,

176
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
I don't agree with you.

177
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,870
Whether or not to have children

178
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,550
is unrelated to wealth or leisure time.

179
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,630
When we were kids,

180
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,870
my family had to struggle to make ends meet.

181
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,390
Yet

182
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,430
the neighbors

183
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,870
raised so many kids,

184
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,510
with three or four children in the family.

185
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,160
There was a classmate in our class

186
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,990
whose family had five children.

187
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,240
How pathetic I was then.

188
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,430
My mom

189
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,480
was widowed but had to bring me up.

190
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,630
My father passed away during my childhood.

191
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,720
I just wished

192
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,190
to have

193
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,310
some siblings.

194
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,950
If something happened,

195
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,870
they would support you.

196
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,720
So I was so lonely back then.

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,430
So I'd been begging

198
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,870
and coaxing Xin

199
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,550
into giving birth

200
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,390
to a second baby.

201
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,190
Then she really got pregnant.

202
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,870
She loves me

203
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,720
and I love her, too.

204
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,600
With excellent genes

205
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,870
and good looks,

206
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,870
it would be a shame not having a second child.

207
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,600
When is the due date

208
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,160
of Xin?

209
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,840
Soon.

210
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,600
Lin,

211
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,390
Cheers.

212
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,550
Your father passed away early.

213
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,280
So did my dad.

214
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,510
You were raised by your elder sister.

215
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,510
While I by my mom.

216
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,870
You know,

217
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,550
if we both have a second child,

218
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,310
then both Yunjie

219
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,280
and Xiongxiong

220
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,950
could have a younger brother or sister,

221
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,510
our two families will thrive with prosperity,

222
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,510
and our entire clan

223
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,600
will be filled with such happiness.

224
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,550
What do you say?

225
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,280
Let me ask you.

226
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,510
Did Mengxin

227
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,510
say something to you?

228
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
No, she didn't.

229
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,750
What

230
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,950
do you mean?

231
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,160
Nothing.

232
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,550
Come on.

233
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,870
I'm

234
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,390
just very happy

235
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,190
as you're

236
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,510
having a second child.

237
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,280
Come on, cheers.

238
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,360
Lin,

239
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,990
I'm sure you're hiding something.

240
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,280
No.

241
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,160
Look at me. Look at me.

242
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,950
Did the physical examination

243
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,270
reveal any other issues

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
of Meng'an?

245
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,510
Zhenzhen,

246
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,790
why aren't you asleep yet?

247
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,150
What's wrong?

248
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,200
I had to work overtime unexpectedly today,

249
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
really couldn't back home early.

250
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,510
Sorry.

251
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,990
Mom.

252
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,320
Could you not go to work anymore?

253
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,150
Let's go back to Dad's home.

254
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,320
Good girl, Zhenzhen.

255
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,790
Mom promises you.

256
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,630
I won't be back

257
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,960
so late next time.

258
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,150
I'd prefer that you don't have to work.

259
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,320
You kids are off to school,

260
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,270
then mom will be boring

261
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,270
at home alone.

262
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,360
Besides,

263
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,990
Mom needs to make money to support you.

264
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,390
How about this, I promise to pick you up

265
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,270
after school tomorrow,

266
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,990
okay?

267
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,510
Well, bed time.

268
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,390
Okay.

269
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,150
Keep your words, mom. Pinky swear.

270
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,910
Okay.

271
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,120
I give

272
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,030
my word.

273
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,990
It's a deal.

274
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,510
All right, baby. Good night.

275
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,990
Good night, mom.

276
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm here to pick you up to go home.

277
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,390
Yet you ask me to walk.

278
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,670
We can enjoy the moon.

279
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,360
Not a good idea.

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,910
I had a hard day at work.

281
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,600
It was cloudy all day long.

282
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,670
Where is the moon?

283
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,320
I can't see it.

284
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,480
Just talk to me, okay?

285
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,560
Just have a chat.

286
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,840
Okay.

287
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,320
Let's have a chat.

288
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,320
Great.

289
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,560
Oh.

290
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,360
Why do you carry candy with you?

291
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,670
You have a bad appetite

292
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,670
and throw up lately, right?

293
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,030
Dad said

294
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,960
it was due to low blood sugar.

295
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,320
So it's prepared for you.

296
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,390
Wanna try it?

297
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Yeah.

298
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,990
Sweet?

299
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,360
Of course.

300
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,390
Very sweet.

301
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,670
Mom,

302
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,670
I've got a question.

303
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,270
Go ahead.

304
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,360
I heard that

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,840
women going through menopause

306
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,670
are no longer able to conceive.

307
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,440
Is it true?

308
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,320
Why are you suddenly asking this?

309
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,960
Just tell me the answer.

310
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,670
I think so.

311
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,360
I'm relieved.

312
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,120
Why do you react like that?

313
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,630
I was at He Lu's home today.

314
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,720
I saw her dad yelling at her mom.

315
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,390
He was

316
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,480
so ferocious.

317
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,960
More ferocious than I yelled at your dad?

318
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,120
Not the same.

319
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,960
Their quarrel was because of He Lu's grandma.

320
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,440
Her grandma took her three-year-old

321
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
brother back home.

322
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,080
Her mother was agitated

323
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,960
because of her grandma's different thoughts.

324
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,510
Then her dad yelled at her mom.

325
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,480
Which brother of her?

326
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,120
Her biological brother!

327
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,360
It's He Lu's secret.

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,150
But I said it out.

329
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,200
You've to keep it a secret.

330
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,080
Secret?

331
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,320
You said it out. Now explain to me.

332
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,510
He Lu's mom gave birth to a second child?

333
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,790
When did this happen?

334
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,320
It's been a few years.

335
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,390
He Lu didn't know it at first.

336
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
Poor her.

337
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,510
No wonder her family got a bigger apartment.

338
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,480
It was all planned.

339
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,360
Since we moved into a bigger one,

340
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,480
are you gonna...?

341
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:33,990
No.

342
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,870
Absolutely not.

343
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,510
So are you and Dad

344
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,600
planning

345
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,150
to have another baby?

346
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,270
No plan.

347
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,510
All right.

348
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,600
You are the only precious baby

349
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,990
of mom and dad.

350
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,150
I'm already 14 years old. You...

351
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,080
But you're always my baby.

352
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,200
Do you truly not

353
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,080
wish for siblings?

354
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,990
You know,

355
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,510
all I ever saw at He Lu's house

356
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,600
was utter chaos.

357
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
It made me headache.

358
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,360
Truly annoying.

359
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,150
Thankfully, it won't happen in our family.

360
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,910
You're going through menopause, aren't you?

361
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,150
Such things are unpredictable.

362
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,600
Then how high is the chance?

363
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,150
Not likely.

364
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,080
Good.

365
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,390
I'm relieved.

366
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,910
Some tonic for you.

367
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,150
I cooked cubilose with milk.

368
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,320
Where did you get it?

369
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,390
Haowen gave it to me.

370
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,990
I ate out with him

371
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,510
and had some drinking.

372
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,510
He drank with you for unhappy things?

373
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,200
It's not what you think.

374
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,870
He has happy things.

375
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,510
Any happy event of them?

376
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,990
Mengxin got pregnant.

377
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
Haowen...

378
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,750
on hearing of...

379
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,510
No, no.

380
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,630
Hadn't she become pregnant long before?

381
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,790
What's wrong with you?

382
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm drunken.

383
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,240
Right.

384
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,440
It's... he...

385
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,480
Say it again.

386
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,360
Haowen got so excited

387
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,910
as he knew

388
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,990
the baby's gonna be

389
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,960
born soon.

390
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
That's it.

391
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,120
Lin

392
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,200
is superb.

393
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,720
He is truly exceptional

394
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,200
at coping with pressure.

395
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,600
Yes.

396
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,630
I even can't stand

397
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,750
Mengxin.

398
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,670
But he can.

399
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,510
It's been hard for him.

400
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,870
He's pretty awesome.

401
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,790
Didn't you originally find him

402
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,720
crude and lacking in refinement,

403
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,750
reluctant to associate with him?

404
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,320
Well...

405
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,750
Why did you drink together?

406
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,960
Vulgar and smooth as he is,

407
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,510
he still can be my friend.

408
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,150
We get along well with each other.

409
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,840
Right?

410
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,080
Look at Haowen, such a great guy -

411
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,750
a big boss,

412
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,910
rich, successful in career,

413
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
and about to welcome his second baby soon.

414
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,510
How wonderful!

415
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm really happy for him.

416
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm jealous of him for you.

417
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,720
Well, no, you...

418
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:30,990
I'm

419
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,150
actually regret it.

420
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,120
I should have listened to you

421
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,270
back then.

422
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,870
I should

423
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,150
make a good effort,

424
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,360
earn and save

425
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,720
more money.

426
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,360
Then we won't

427
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,750
be hard up

428
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
and can't afford

429
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,990
to give birth to a second baby.

430
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,750
Right?

431
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,750
It's not

432
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,720
about the financial burden.

433
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,390
What is it then?

434
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,560
Yunjie

435
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,150
felt me out today.

436
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,480
She asked me

437
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,790
if I wouldn't be able to have a second child

438
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,870
as I entered menopause.

439
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,870
What does she mean?

440
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,960
She doesn't want a sibling.

441
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,910
What did you say?

442
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,270
I...

443
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,360
I just pacified her.

444
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,600
I said

445
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,480
she's our only precious daughter.

446
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,480
Then...

447
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,150
I'd to say

448
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,480
I'm nearly step in menopause.

449
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,720
So there's still room for change.

450
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,390
That's good.

451
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,360
Why?

452
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,670
Not good.

453
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,360
I've been unsure to keep it or not.

454
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,870
The previous problem hasn't been sorted out,

455
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,320
yet a new one arises.

456
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,960
You didn't tell Haowen about this, right?

457
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,150
No.

458
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,790
I didn't.

459
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,910
Keep it secret. Don't tell anyone.

460
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,080
We

461
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,200
have to think about the baby issue.

462
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,600
Let's think it over.

463
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,150
Drink it up.

464
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,670
It's getting cold.

465
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,150
I feel upset.

466
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
How could you know it?

467
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,760
Did Lin tell you?

468
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,280
I guess it right?

469
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,000
Jia Haowen, you fox!

470
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,600
Is she really pregnant?

471
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,190
How dare you! Jia Haowen.

472
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,040
You're quite cunning.

473
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,760
Who told you that?

474
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,430
Say it!

475
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,390
You're not gonna sleep

476
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,080
if you don't confess today.

477
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,190
Dear, no one told me about it.

478
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,080
I went to eat out with Lin.

479
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,150
I talked about you're having the second baby.

480
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,190
But he spoke with hesitation,

481
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,870
and tried to cover up something.

482
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,600
I felt he had a secret.

483
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,150
Turns out I'm right!

484
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,520
You're an outsider.

485
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,760
Don't mess with it.

486
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,950
Meng'an doesn't want to have the baby.

487
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,320
Otherwise,

488
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,670
her career is doomed to failure.

489
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,280
Honey,

490
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,760
it's not as terrible as you said.

491
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,910
The women in my company

492
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,950
also need to bear a baby.

493
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,430
Besides, she's already

494
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,560
a director.

495
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
It won't affect it.

496
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,190
Bah!

497
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,670
Wrong!

498
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,230
After I delivered Xiongxiong,

499
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,080
have I ever gone to work

500
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,360
for even a single day in these six years?

501
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
Aren't you unwilling to go to work?

502
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,760
Don't I wanna go to work?

503
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,840
Or you tried

504
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,710
to stop me from getting employed?

505
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Gently, please.

506
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,630
It's god's will.

507
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,710
God makes you stay

508
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,150
at home living in ease and comfort.

509
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,390
I'm gonna leave home for work tomorrow.

510
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,670
You stay home to take care of the kid.

511
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,280
No, no.

512
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,800
Darling,

513
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,760
Please don't do this.

514
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,630
I go out

515
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,360
to fight in business battle,

516
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,560
while you just

517
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,360
stay at home.

518
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,190
You'll be the commander at home.

519
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,150
The children and I will listen to your order.

520
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,950
We'll go to hit the target

521
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,670
as you say.

522
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,870
I hit you. I hit you!

523
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,390
I hit you!

524
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,870
I...

525
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,190
hit you!

526
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,870
Now good things come

527
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,710
in pairs.

528
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,150
That drink was truly worth it.

529
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,470
I'll tell you what.

530
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,080
Keep out of it!

531
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,150
So happy!

532
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,760
We're gonna have a large family.

533
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,000
How foolish this child would be

534
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
to take after you!

535
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,470
Honey,

536
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,520
of course the baby takes after you.

537
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,150
Today, your mom is taking a break,

538
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,950
and your dad is off to work.

539
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,800
How about your dad drops you off at school?

540
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,630
Great!

541
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm done with eating.

542
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,430
Finished?

543
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,150
Are you really that dissatisfied

544
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,600
with me taking you to school?

545
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,760
Of course not.

546
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,560
I really love it.

547
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,670
Time to go.

548
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,600
Off now.

549
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,950
Bye.

550
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,390
Have you truly had enough?

551
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,000
Leave the tableware for me.

552
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,800
I'll clean them up when I get back.

553
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,150
It's nice to be on the front passenger seat.

554
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,360
Comfy?

555
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,280
Yeah.

556
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,360
Good.

557
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,190
That's great.

558
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,760
When you come of age,

559
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,870
I'll go with you for your driver's license test.

560
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,390
You'll be driving the car.

561
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,040
I'll be on the front passenger seat.

562
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,360
I can enjoy it, too.

563
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,760
Okay.

564
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,670
Then

565
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,870
I'll drive to the place as you want.

566
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,950
Stop at that milk tea shop ahead.

567
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,190
What do you want?

568
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,000
Buy a cup of milk tea.

569
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,150
Are you serious?

570
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,670
Do you remember your mom

571
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,080
telling you not to eat in the car?

572
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,320
She is not here.

573
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,390
But you still can't do this.

574
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,280
Do you remember

575
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,360
when I took you

576
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
to have fried chicken

577
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,710
in the car?

578
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,950
You were happily enjoying it,

579
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,320
but I had to spend ages to remove the smell.

580
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,760
Yet the moment your mom got into the car,

581
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,520
she detected the scent

582
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,230
and

583
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,320
gave me an earful.

584
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,280
But the milk tea is odorless.

585
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,320
What if it spills

586
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,800
in the car?

587
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,190
I promise it won't happen.

588
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,280
No way.

589
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,190
Please?

590
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,150
No.

591
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,390
I promise I'm not gonna spill it.

592
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,280
Then you'd be careful later.

593
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,360
I'll drive slowly, too.

594
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,190
Excellent!

595
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,280
Having a dad like you,

596
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,710
I'm so lucky!

597
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,560
Fine, fine.

598
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,320
What am I gonna do with you?

599
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,040
Which shop?

600
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,190
The one in front.

601
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,670
[That one, right?]

602
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,280
Yes.

603
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,190
[Okay.]

604
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,430
I'm here!

605
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,120
Come on!

606
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,000
Ten meters to go.

607
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,600
The scene is good here.

608
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,190
But I'm exhausted.

609
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,390
How could this happen?

610
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,320
How many breaks did you take in between?

611
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,320
Five times.

612
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,000
Given over 400 steps, it's reasonable.

613
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,910
Good. You know how to look after yourself.

614
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
But to be honest,

615
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,870
you lack physical strength.

616
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,870
You don't get enough exercise.

617
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,230
You know?

618
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,190
You've got weak legs.

619
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,710
You're trying to take me

620
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,910
climb high and look far?

621
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,520
Are you gonna discuss with me

622
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,470
for something serious?

623
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,600
Yeah, I would like to ask you for a favor.

624
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,000
Then you go ahead,

625
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,520
I'll catch my breath first.

626
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,150
Okay, get some water.

627
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm gonna

628
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,150
hold a real estate trade show.

629
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,080
Just introduce to me anyone you know

630
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
who are capable of or interested in purchasing a house.

631
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
Real estate trade show?

632
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,760
I wish my apartment

633
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,150
hasn't been bought.

634
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,670
Otherwise, I might even get a discount from you.

635
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,630
There's no discount,

636
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,190
but you can save on some property management fees.

637
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,710
I already negotiated it with the salesman.

638
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,150
You're selling it like hot cakes.

639
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,320
Doesn't Yu Hai have a problem with that?

640
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,190
You were classmates.

641
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,710
I bet you know him well.

642
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,150
So are you gonna

643
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,190
go against him?

644
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,230
I've to work.

645
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,870
I've to earn money to support my children.

646
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,150
Yu Hai has entrusted his lawyer

647
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,190
to fight me for custody.

648
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,470
What should I do?

649
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,760
No way.

650
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,710
Yu Hai won't be so mean.

651
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,670
Yeah.

652
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,470
I know he just tries to scare me.

653
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,630
He always thought that

654
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,150
I wasn't serious about divorcing him,

655
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,230
and when I get bored,

656
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,280
I'll go back home.

657
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,230
But this time,

658
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,320
I truly want to tell him that

659
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,710
I am serious about the divorce.

660
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,150
I'm not kidding.

661
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,670
He doesn't

662
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,150
understand what you mean.

663
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,520
Not just him.

664
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,760
Many friends around me

665
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,230
think I'm joking.

666
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,840
They think you're playing tricks

667
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,150
to teach your husband a lesson.

668
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,600
To be frank,

669
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,670
that's what I was thinking at first.

670
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,760
Come on!

671
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,710
You don't know me well either.

672
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,800
But you asked me to help you

673
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,910
find a job later,

674
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,390
then I knew

675
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,630
you meant it.

676
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,910
Have you made any preparations

677
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,800
for the trade show?

678
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,430
It's all ready.

679
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,560
I made

680
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,760
a presentation.

681
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,190
Please help me review it.

682
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,910
I don't think one presentation is convincing.

683
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,760
How about

684
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,710
I send our presentations

685
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,840
for real estate clients

686
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,150
for your reference?

687
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,950
Great.

688
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,190
You can't just sell them.

689
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,600
You must be the top sales.

690
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,870
You truly live up to the title of Content Director.

691
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,390
Impressive.

692
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,360
We can't go up here for nothing.

693
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,910
We are here for a broader view.

694
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,840
[Hi, Mrs. Yu.]

695
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,670
Hi, Mrs. Wang.

696
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,630
It's been a long time.

697
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,670
You can see

698
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,360
we have...

699
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,430
Hi ladies,

700
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,710
you're in such a good mood today.

701
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,600
Learning flower arrangement, huh?

702
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,800
Hi, Mrs. Yu.

703
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,760
Long time no see.

704
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,000
Wu Tong, you've lost weight.

705
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,560
Mrs. Mo,

706
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,520
you look elegant today.

707
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,190
Wanzhen,

708
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,560
Did you actually move?

709
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,910
Right.

710
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,910
Why did you move out suddenly?

711
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,150
I hear from Mr. Yu that

712
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,150
you're doing some business all by yourself.

713
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,950
That's why

714
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,360
you moved to the city, I guess.

715
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,430
My relationship with him

716
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,670
isn't the same as before.

717
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,320
You already have two kids,

718
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
are you truly considering a divorce,

719
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,470
as others said?

720
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,390
Wanzhen,

721
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,600
be sure to act wisely.

722
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,760
Mr. Yu's career soars.

723
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,910
If you divorce him now,

724
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,800
another woman

725
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
would take the advantage.

726
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,710
Don't worry.

727
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,150
I've been though it through.

728
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,910
I'll fight for custody of the kid,

729
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,950
getting ready

730
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,190
for the future too.

731
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,320
Is he cheating?

732
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,800
Let's change the topic.

733
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,840
I'm coming today

734
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,760
to invite all of you

735
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,600
for our company's wine party.

736
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,670
Here is the invitation for you.

737
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,910
Why did Mrs. Yu come back?

738
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,150
Mrs. Yu?

739
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,560
Better not to call her Mrs. Yu right now.

740
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,150
You've no idea about it?

741
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,280
She moved out

742
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
with her kids.

743
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,000
Divorced?

744
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,710
Oh, there's another one got divorced.

745
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,950
Who knows what happens?

746
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
We're not sure about

747
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,840
their current relationship,

748
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,120
right?

749
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,800
It's not our business.

750
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,950
Holding wine parties to sell houses?

751
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,840
Here you go, Mrs. Wu.

752
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,760
[Right.]

753
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,040
Mrs. Chen.

754
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,910
Oh.

755
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,840
You really went to this firm

756
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,150
to sell real estate?

757
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,520
Yeah, I've worked there for a short time.

758
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,390
By the way,

759
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Xu Mengxin in our community

760
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,800
also bought one from me

761
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,710
for investment.

762
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,560
I'll set aside

763
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,430
the best house type

764
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,230
for you.

765
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
You guys have to come!

766
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,190
Be sure to come!

767
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,000
Okay, we'll go together then.

768
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,800
That's for sure.

769
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,320
Besides selling the property,

770
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,150
this wine party

771
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,670
will also feature

772
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,190
a personal segment about me.

773
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,280
I'll explain

774
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,670
my current relationship

775
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,320
with Yu Hai.

776
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
It's a press conference.

777
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,520
It won't be that big.

778
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,190
You guys

779
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,870
usually concern a lot about me.

780
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,150
I guess you wanna know

781
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,800
what really goes on between me and him.

782
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,600
That will save you

783
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,710
the guess.

784
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,950
I'll invite Mr. Yu over

785
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,710
on this wine party.

786
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,630
And then I'll explain

787
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,870
what happens between us.

788
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,390
What's going on with you and him?

789
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,390
Why is it that

790
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,670
you get a divorce?

791
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,000
Mrs. Mo,

792
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,760
you'll know it

793
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,800
in the party.

794
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:50,600
All right.

795
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,320
I'm leaving.

796
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,280
You can continue with the flower arrangement.

797
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,190
Leaving so soon?

798
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,520
Yeah.

799
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,150
Bye.

800
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,840
Bye.

801
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,910
Are you up yet?

802
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,360
Don't get me started.

803
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,910
I'm lying in bed now,

804
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,320
unable to sleep

805
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,800
or even get up.

806
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,950
It's utterly miserable.

807
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,630
What's wrong?

808
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,040
[I've got an aching waist]

809
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,150
[and numb legs.]

810
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,360
I just don't feel well lying down.

811
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,910
Are you calling me for anything?

812
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,870
Nothing important.

813
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,910
How do you...

814
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,150
feel about

815
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,870
the private

816
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,910
maternity hospital

817
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,950
you're attending now?

818
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,870
Why do you ask?

819
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,390
Have you decided to deliver the baby?

820
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,870
No.

821
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,190
I'm in a vacation now.

822
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,230
[I'm concerned that if]

823
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,870
[I opt for abortion surgery at a public hospital,]

824
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,600
[I might not]

825
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,760
secure an appointment in time.

826
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,150
I hope to know more of the hospital you visit.

827
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,950
You startled me!

828
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,870
You know what.

829
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,470
If you give birth to this child,

830
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,670
the same misery will come upon you.

831
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,360
[Even worse,]

832
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,320
[you'll suffer even more at your age.]

833
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,080
Stop it.

834
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:51,950
Just tell me about the hospital.

835
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,150
It's a nice place.

836
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,870
I'll ask

837
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,710
my attending doctor about it.

838
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,870
Okay.

839
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,800
Please ask for me.

840
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,190
By the way,

841
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,040
guess what?

842
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,000
[Haowen knows you're pregnant.]

843
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,280
You told it to him?

844
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,520
Absolutely not me!

845
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,950
He figured it out by himself.

846
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,840
Lin ate with him.

847
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
Lin is not the one to lie.

848
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,360
You two really gossipy.

849
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
You two

850
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,520
are just similar.

851
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,390
[Both of you act like paparazzi.]

852
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,430
Listen up.

853
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,150
You must make it clear to Jia Haowen that

854
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,670
this cannot be mentioned to our parents,

855
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,190
got it?

856
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,760
You are right,

857
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,150
I'll remind him right away.

858
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,760
Or

859
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
he'd try to impress my mom

860
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,710
by telling it to her.

861
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,280
I... I'll call him right now.

862
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,760
[Bye.]

863
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:46,910
Haowen...

864
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,600
Hire me?

865
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,910
Does Mengxin know it?

866
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
No.

867
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,190
But

868
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,950
you've got the nerve to tell me this?

869
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,710
Meng'an, let me explain.

870
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,600
My company

871
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,760
needs to hire

872
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,360
a consultant on new media.

873
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,710
Select the worthy without avoiding relatives.

874
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,710
The annual salary is CNY 200,000.

875
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,520
You're the right one for this post.

876
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,430
A consultant?

877
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,430
Twenty thousand for

878
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,870
a part-time consultant?

879
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,040
Meng'an,

880
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,430
I think you're worth of the pay.

881
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,000
Really.

882
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,470
Looks like you're giving me money.

883
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,150
Meng'an,

884
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,950
I may be

885
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,190
older than you.

886
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,870
But I'm your brother-in-law.

887
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,760
I know there is something

888
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,000
I shouldn't mention to you.

889
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,360
But

890
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,630
I recently found something I'd to say.

891
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
What is it?

892
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,360
I think Lin has something

893
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
on his mind lately.

894
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,710
He looks a little glum.

895
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,870
This must be what you truly intended to

896
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,150
discuss with me today, isn't it?

897
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,800
Indeed, you intellectuals

898
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,520
are just smart.

899
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,360
I haven't even said it

900
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,390
yet you already understand.

901
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,870
Just tell me.

902
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,120
Meng'an,

903
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,390
we've been all

904
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,630
working very hard.

905
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,470
It's all

906
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,800
for the sake of our families.

907
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,840
Don't you wanna think

908
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,150
about giving birth to the baby?

909
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,280
The fetus

910
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,710
is like a little bud,

911
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,470
and will grow up over months.

912
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,950
Soon, the baby will be born.

913
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,800
From the moment of birth,

914
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,190
there will be tears and smiles,

915
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,670
and later the baby grows to play.

916
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,390
In the future, the child cares for you

917
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,150
and calls you Mom.

918
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,520
What a bliss!

919
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,430
Meng'an,

920
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,950
just talk with me for any worries.

921
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,320
We are families.

922
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,950
[I know you're the decision-maker in your family.]

923
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,230
[But have you ever]

924
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,280
[given a thought to]

925
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,190
[Lin's idea about keeping the baby?]

926
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,910
Allow me to consider this question

927
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,950
from the viewpoint of my brother-in-law.

928
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,710
Because I think

929
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,910
we're just alike.

930
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
[I grew up with only my widowed mother,]

931
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,280
[and his parents passed away]

932
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,360
[when he was a little child.]

933
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,520
[I know]

934
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,320
[neither of us has a big family.]

935
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,840
He'll surely

936
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,600
wish to have

937
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,000
one more kid.

938
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,840
[Well, if you'll give birth]

939
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,470
[to a second baby as Mengxin,]

940
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,190
Mom and Dad would be so happy

941
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,870
to see the big family when we back home.

942
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,520
The children play at the yard

943
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,870
at the Spring Festival.

944
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,950
The elder ones

945
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,190
lead their younger siblings

946
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,670
as kids love to play together.

947
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,710
How happy they'd be!

948
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,560
You know,

949
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,870
when I was dating with Mengxin,

950
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,800
every time I upset her,

951
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,760
she'd say,

952
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,710
"I'm going to get my sister."

953
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,320
I would argue, "it was between us,

954
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,950
why do you keep involving your sister?"

955
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,710
Then she would explain that

956
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,950
you are like a heroine.

957
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,760
And if I dared to make her upset,

958
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,870
you'd stand up for her.

959
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,800
Besides,

960
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,520
Xiongxiong also said to Xin,

961
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,360
"Mom, have another brother for me,

962
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,910
so when bad kids mess with me,

963
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,040
and beat us up,

964
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,520
the two of us can stand up for each other."

965
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,600
As long as Mengxin agrees,

966
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm ready

967
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,520
to have more kids,

968
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,870
so many that our family portrait

969
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,390
won't be able to contain us all in one frame.

970
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,230
Isn't it great, Meng'an?

971
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,760
I think it's a kind of happiness.

972
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,870
Mengxin may not give birth to so many babies.

973
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,280
Haowen.

974
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,910
What you said

975
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,390
is reasonable.

976
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,150
I agree with you.

977
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,760
But my family doesn't

978
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,320
run like yours.

979
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,000
You all know that

980
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,470
I'm the decision maker in my family.

981
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,800
But our financial stuff

982
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,150
is in the hands of Lin.

983
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,150
I know you mean well.

984
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
You wanna lend me a hand,

985
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,150
offering me this part-time work,

986
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,870
but

987
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,390
it puts me in an awkward position.

988
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,910
Don't get me wrong.

989
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,150
I just say what I feel.

990
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,910
Today I feel embarrassed

991
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,320
hearing your offer.

992
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,190
Have you ever considered

993
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,280
the position Lin would be in

994
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,190
if I were to give him the money every time?

995
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,150
what'd he feel?

996
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,150
When he spends the money,

997
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,950
he'd be overthinking.

998
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,870
If this becomes a regular occurrence,

999
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,760
Lin...

1000
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,390
I can't say for sure

1001
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,870
how long he can maintain this state.

1002
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,710
But he certainly cannot make it now.

1003
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,120
If what I just said

1004
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,520
happens,

1005
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,600
our family

1006
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,080
won't have democracy and equality.

1007
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,670
It will be out of balance.

1008
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,710
How can we

1009
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,190
call it happiness?

1010
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,280
As a man,

1011
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,760
you should understand

1012
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,080
what I've said.

1013
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,760
Right?

1014
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:40,840
Or you can

1015
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,320
engage in the medical business.

1016
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,710
Get Lin a job.

1017
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:44,950
Meng'an,

1018
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,390
you are kidding me.

1019
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,950
That's a completely new industry to me.

1020
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,470
Let's see how it goes.

1021
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,710
Mr. Li.

1022
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,350
Mr. Li.

1023
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,880
The procedure is complete.

1024
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,750
Just have the dean

1025
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,880
sign here,

1026
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,630
then all is done.

1027
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,150
Thank you.

1028
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,710
Never mind, Mr. Li.

1029
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,920
We're all gonna work together.

1030
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,790
Yeah, right.

1031
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,790
You can just call my name.

1032
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,830
Mr. Li,

1033
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,310
the dean's office

1034
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,960
is on the east side of the fourth floor.

1035
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,710
Got it, all right.

1036
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll go by myself.

1037
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,670
Okay.

1038
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,790
Bye, Mr. Li

1039
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,830
Bye.

1040
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,560
Mr. Ma,

1041
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,480
You are aware of

1042
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,960
my academic ability.

1043
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,000
Dr. Ji,

1044
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,600
it's not that I won't help you.

1045
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,000
You know the college's policy

1046
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,150
to hire a teacher.

1047
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,920
[You're not releasing enough papers]

1048
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,560
[nor significant academic accomplishments.]

1049
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,710
[I really can't keep you here.]

1050
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,230
My kid is still young.

1051
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,710
frequently falls ill,

1052
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,710
[and with his father away,]

1053
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,480
[I must]

1054
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,560
[care for him by myself.]

1055
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,560
Dr. Ji,

1056
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,150
if you're

1057
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,350
still like this,

1058
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,880
you won't be qualified for academic research.

1059
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,000
I'll figure something out for you.

1060
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,150
Look.

1061
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,190
I had the most confidence in you.

1062
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,120
Mr. Ma.

1063
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,520
Please come in.

1064
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,600
Li Lin.

1065
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,150
Come in!

1066
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,630
Are all the formalities done?

1067
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,600
Yeah.

1068
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,790
All I need is your signature now.

1069
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,880
You've seen that female doctor.

1070
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,790
I thought she could

1071
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,000
be successful just like Mei Yiduo.

1072
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,270
[But during these two years]

1073
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,920
[she's not even focusing on academics.]

1074
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,830
Mei Yiduo works really hard.

1075
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,710
She is even divorced for her academic developments.

1076
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,000
You know it?

1077
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,790
She'll be back soon.

1078
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm planning

1079
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,400
to invite this famous scientist

1080
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,670
to our college.

1081
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,440
[I'm gonna]

1082
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,920
[leave it to you.]

1083
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,480
Now that you've found a job,

1084
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,480
shouldn't we be heading home

1085
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
to celebrate it?

1086
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,190
Why do you bring me up here?

1087
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,230
My business is done.

1088
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,120
Now I wanna talk to you

1089
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,670
about the baby.

1090
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,520
You asked me

1091
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,270
if I wanted the baby or not that night.

1092
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,080
I said yes.

1093
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,790
It was an instinctive reaction.

1094
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,880
In fact, we've been deliberately

1095
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
avoiding to face this problem

1096
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,830
in the past few days.

1097
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,830
That's because

1098
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,080
it is indeed

1099
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,880
worthy of us

1100
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,270
giving it a careful consideration.

1101
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,670
I know

1102
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
you

1103
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,630
love the baby.

1104
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,120
But my dear,

1105
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,670
you only think about the present.

1106
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,440
But I worry about the future.

1107
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,270
Over the past decade or so,

1108
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,830
we've both worked hard

1109
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,830
to live

1110
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,080
a better life.

1111
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,190
But now if we have another kid,

1112
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,440
our family may

1113
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,080
go through

1114
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
hard life again

1115
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,310
in the next decade

1116
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,920
or even longer.

1117
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm not afraid of the hardship.

1118
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,040
I can cope with it.

1119
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,000
I know you can go it through too.

1120
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,440
However,

1121
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,350
I can't let you and Yunjie

1122
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,310
suffer with me

1123
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,790
again.

1124
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,190
So,

1125
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,270
it seems we may not

1126
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,120
be meant to have this child.

1127
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,630
I can't give birth to a second baby

1128
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,270
given our financial situation.

1129
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,440
Raising one child is already challenging,

1130
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,310
let alone two.

1131
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,120
You're unemployed now,

1132
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,960
and I'm pregnant, staying at home.

1133
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
How can we

1134
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,830
make a living?

1135
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,750
Pick a day

1136
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,480
to get the surgical abortion done.

1137
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,480
I can't let us

1138
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,400
live in hardships all the time.

1139
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,440
So,

1140
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,960
it seems we may not

1141
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,600
be meant to have this child.

1142
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,120
He'll surely

1143
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,670
wanna have

1144
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,520
one more kid.

1145
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,270
What's up?

1146
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,230
In a bad mood?

1147
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,600
I want to climb high

1148
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,480
and see far.

1149
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,230
What's going on?

1150
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,440
I've discussed with Li Lin.

1151
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,920
We've decided

1152
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,600
not to have this child.

1153
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,830
You don't want it?

1154
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,230
Why?

1155
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,120
We cannot afford it.

1156
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,670
We have cancelled Yunjie's Piano lessons.

1157
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,150
Although her teacher said

1158
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,710
she won't make achievement on it,

1159
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,630
her father and I know that

1160
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,190
she still wants to learn it.

1161
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,120
If we have enough money...

1162
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,190
If we have to raise another baby,

1163
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,080
the life

1164
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,480
will be harder.

1165
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,190
I'm over forty years old.

1166
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,190
yet I feel very helpless now.

1167
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,520
I get

1168
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,000
what you said.

1169
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,040
Raising a child

1170
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,880
is not a matter of making him survival now.

1171
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,920
Instead, it's about

1172
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,830
how to raise the child well.

1173
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,000
[It's not because of a desire to compete,]

1174
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,830
but the love that we hold for children.

1175
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,520
Let's see

1176
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,600
how it goes.
