English subtitles are available

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:45,530
Just in Time EP05

3
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,680
Let's get a divorce.

4
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,439
Wanzhen, we...

5
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,320
Can we not joke about this?

6
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,719
Yeah, I came with a colleague today

7
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,400
to check out some houses.

8
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,839
But

9
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,279
I had no idea

10
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:22,999
how did we end up here.

11
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,839
She dragged me along.

12
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,279
She said she wanted my advice.

13
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:26,999
You know,

14
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,880
I'm really into buying houses,

15
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,079
right?

16
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,999
I've bought so many houses.

17
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,240
Keep making things up.

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
No, seriously,

19
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm being wronged!

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,759
I really just came with her.

21
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,200
I don't care if it's a misunderstanding.

22
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,039
I want a divorce.

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,279
Did you hear me clearly?

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,559
No, no, Wanzhen.

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
We've been married for ten years,

26
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,879
and we've never

27
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,839
mentioned divorce.

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
This is the first time you've said it.

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,759
Where's your wedding ring?

30
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,839
You usually

31
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,279
don't wear it either, do you?

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
No, I just find it

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,920
uncomfortable to wear,

34
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,240
but you always wear yours.

35
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,039
Yu Hai,

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,279
in the past ten years of our marriage,

37
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:09,920
I haven't

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,080
brought up divorce, right?

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,879
This is the first

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,319
and last time.

41
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,439
This isn't a warning,

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,480
it's my decision.

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,200
This marriage,

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
I'm determined to end it.

45
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,279
Wanzhen,

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,159
We, the two of us...

47
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,719
Wanzhen,

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
we built everything

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,039
from scratch together.

50
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:33,039
And our child is only eight years old.

51
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,640
What are you trying to do?

52
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,400
Wait, is it because

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,719
of what happened with your mom?

54
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,200
How about

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,039
we see a therapist?

56
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,319
What the hell do you want?

57
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,839
Why do you keep calling me?

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,839
Yeah.

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,599
I forgot

60
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,640
about the dinner with Mr. Zhang.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,200
Okay, got it.

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,960
Wanzhen,

63
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,640
well...

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,400
I have to go to dinner

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,920
with someone tonight.

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,480
A very important investor.

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
If I don't drink too much tonight,

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,599
I'll definitely come home, okay?

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
Let's talk properly at home tonight.

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,439
Alright?

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,719
You quit your job first, okay?

72
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm leaving now.

73
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,480
See?

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,920
They've set up tents, right?

75
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,879
Can we negotiate

76
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,439
the price again?

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
My car

78
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,680
has never been in an accident,

79
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,639
and it's regularly maintained.

80
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,559
Sure.

81
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,759
Okay.

82
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,439
Then give me a call

83
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,439
when you're free

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,920
or I can drive it over.

85
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,879
Alright?

86
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,040
There's a puppy.

87
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
So cute!

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,280
Alright, alright.

89
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,079
Thank you.

90
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,480
Let's keep in touch.

91
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,480
Where are the things?

92
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,920
She didn't let me take them.

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Why?

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,079
Ask her.

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
It's been half a year,

96
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,280
and we're only camping once.

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,879
Do we really need to unpack everything?

98
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,040
I wanted to sell them online

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,240
for a good price.

100
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
These are enough.

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,559
Why sell them?

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
We bought those tents and chairs

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
for camping, didn't we?

104
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Yeah,

105
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,680
look,

106
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,040
see all those around us.

107
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,160
Every family has a tent, right?

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,079
If we lie here without one,

109
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,759
don't you think

110
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,519
we're a bit out of place?

111
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,079
I think it's fine.

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,079
Are you upset today?

113
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,559
I'm happy.

114
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,680
Really happy?

115
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Really happy.

116
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
How else should I show it?

117
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,759
So nice.

118
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,079
The sun is out.

119
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,240
Block it a bit.

120
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,280
No need.

121
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,600
Maybe I should

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
rent a tent

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
and get a lounge chair or something.

124
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,840
No need, it's not that sunny today.

125
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,840
Do you want some barbecue?

126
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,199
Ask your dad to rent a grill.

127
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:58,680
How's that?

128
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,399
Then...

129
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,999
Just lying like this

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,559
counts as camping?

131
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,999
Feels too basic.

132
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,079
Let's play a game.

133
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,680
It sounds good.

134
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,519
Sure, sure, sure.

135
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,360
What do we play?

136
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,559
Truth.

137
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,399
Truth?

138
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,680
How to?

139
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
I know.

140
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,439
Truth or dare, right?

141
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,160
They go together.

142
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes, but this

143
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,519
has no dares.

144
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,879
Wait, how do you know?

145
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,639
When I'm out with Mr. Zhang for business,

146
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,519
sometimes we need

147
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,480
to liven up the mood.

148
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,879
Not good.

149
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,639
Just know a bit.

150
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,319
Quick, tell your dad

151
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:37,680
how to play.

152
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Truth is like this,

153
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,079
we play Rock-Paper-Scissors.

154
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,079
and the loser

155
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,079
has to answer a question.

156
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,600
It must be the truth.

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,120
Wanna play?

158
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,720
Sure.

159
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:46,920
Come on.

160
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,319
Come on.

161
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,879
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

162
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,319
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

163
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,280
See?

164
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,920
Perfect match.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:55,999
Here we go.

166
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,040
Oh, I see.

167
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:57,800
You ask, okay?

168
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,519
No getting mad.

169
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:58,879
I'll ask.

170
00:07:58,999 --> 00:07:59,759
No getting mad!

171
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,840
You and Liu Siming...

172
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,920
Since Liu Siming joined your class,

173
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,840
has he affected

174
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,999
your studies?

175
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,999
I knew you were going to ask that.

176
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,680
You promised not to get mad.

177
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm ready for this.

178
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,120
Why would I get mad?

179
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,399
Actually, I know what you're

180
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,280
worried about.

181
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,519
It's just about puppy love

182
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,999
affecting studies, right?

183
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,559
Don't worry.

184
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,519
I didn't do well on this exam

185
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
because

186
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,720
I haven't been studying well lately,

187
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,519
it has nothing to do

188
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,519
with puppy love.

189
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,360
So, you and Liu Siming...

190
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,480
Next question, okay?

191
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:39,840
Honey.

192
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,040
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

193
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,879
You and Liu Siming...

194
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,840
Liu Siming is just like a husky.

195
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,999
Chased by a husky?

196
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,519
I'd rather hide myself.

197
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
This is pretty much what I expected.

198
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,120
Back when you were in school,

199
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
did you have someone chasing you too?

200
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,040
And

201
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,680
did you

202
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,399
find it romantic?

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,879
No.

204
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,120
It was all just trouble.

205
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,120
Everything was out of sync.

206
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
And I was overly scrutinized.

207
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,999
No way.

208
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,799
I'm different from your aunt.

209
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,080
She really enjoys

210
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,159
being chased.

211
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:10,960
You know,

212
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,080
that's so great!

213
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,159
Amazing!

214
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,879
So, how did you handle it?

215
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,440
I didn't need to handle it.

216
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,519
Just let him chase.

217
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,600
If you ignore him,

218
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,360
in two or three months,

219
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,480
he'll move on to someone else.

220
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,799
Take note.

221
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,240
Learn from that.

222
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,360
That guy was not as handsome as my dad.

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
Of course.

224
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,560
Your dad

225
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
is incredibly handsome.

226
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Come on, let's continue.

227
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,320
Come on.

228
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,519
Let's go.

229
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,039
Continue.

230
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,480
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

231
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,840
Oh my.

232
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,519
Alright, Dad, let me ask you.

233
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,919
I choose Dare.

234
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:41,999
No way.

235
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:42,879
You know how to play too?

236
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,240
Didn't you just say so?

237
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,440
Really?

238
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
Why don't I believe it?

239
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:49,679
Ask him,

240
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,320
Sweetie.

241
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,799
Okay.

242
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,639
Truth.

243
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,480
Did you lose your job?

244
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,399
Your dad

245
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,519
had a temporary issue at work.

246
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,200
I guessed it.

247
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,480
Dad,

248
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,799
I believe in you.

249
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,679
You're so capable,

250
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,720
you'll

251
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,679
find a new job soon.

252
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,560
Don't worry.

253
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,759
Plus, with such a handsome dad,

254
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,879
you could be an actor.

255
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Let's continue!

256
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,519
Come on.

257
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:41,999
Again?

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,080
Come on, come on.

259
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,279
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

260
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,080
Alright, Ms. Xu Meng'an,

261
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,320
I've got a question for you.

262
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,320
Do you want to sell

263
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,240
our family car?

264
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
How do you know everything?

265
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,679
How did you find out?

266
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm also part of the family, you know.

267
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,200
Some things,

268
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
even if you don't tell me,

269
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,999
I still find out.

270
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,159
Listen,

271
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,080
Ms. Xu Meng'an,

272
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,879
the car cannot be sold.

273
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,039
It's part of your

274
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,159
CEO image.

275
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,759
Unless

276
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,440
you sell it to buy a better one.

277
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,999
What's up with you two?

278
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
Why don't you look excited?

279
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:32,999
Excited, sure.

280
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,560
Excited.

281
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:34,279
Excited.

282
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,039
Alright.

283
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,879
Let me share a secret with you.

284
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,720
My secret, okay?

285
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:37,720
What secret?

286
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,480
I've mastered a special skill.

287
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,759
I can mimic both your signatures.

288
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,679
They're almost

289
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,560
indistinguishable from yours.

290
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,919
Even teachers can't tell.

291
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:55,759
Have you signed?

292
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,320
How many times?

293
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,480
Any failed papers?

294
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
The teacher didn't notice?

295
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,759
There are big bubbles.

296
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,639
Let me take a look.

297
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,480
In calligraphy,

298
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
this is called copying.

299
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,879
It's part of the process.

300
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,039
Our girl has grown up.

301
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,279
She knows how to comfort us now.

302
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,200
Haowen,

303
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,639
what do you mean?

304
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,679
You didn't come to the check-up today.

305
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,799
Do you really

306
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,639
want the baby?

307
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,240
Honey, honey,

308
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,320
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,679
The new product launch at the company

310
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,560
is starting soon.

311
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,039
Look.

312
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:23,240
Mr. Jia.

313
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,999
It's so lively.

314
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,480
Mr. Jia,

315
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,639
they're selecting products over there.

316
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,279
Are you coming?

317
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,879
I'll be right there. You go ahead.

318
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,720
Hand out some benefits to the customers.

319
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,600
Go ahead.

320
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,399
I'll join you soon.

321
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,240
Okay, okay.

322
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,120
Xin,

323
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:34,960
It's starting soon.

324
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,879
I'm going over now.

325
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,240
Wait.

326
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,159
Who is that woman?

327
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,679
A collaborating influencer

328
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,879
invited by the company.

329
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,320
An influencer?

330
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,039
How come I didn't know?

331
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,320
Honey, I'll make sure

332
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,679
to inform you immediately next time.

333
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,480
Be good.

334
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,600
Check the trunk.

335
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:51,679
There's a secret.

336
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,919
A surprise for you

337
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Don't try to fool me with this.

338
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,720
Always trying to distract me with stuff.

339
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't care.

340
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,279
I wouldn't dare, honey.

341
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm hanging up now.

342
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,519
What are you filming?

343
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:20,799
Mrs. Jia,

344
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,560
hello, hello.

345
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,919
How do you know I'm Mrs. Jia?

346
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,039
I know everyone

347
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,120
in this neighborhood.

348
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,759
It's unethical

349
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,519
to take candid photos.

350
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,240
I'm just following.

351
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,679
Following, you know.

352
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,039
Mrs. Jia, if you need

353
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,240
anything followed,

354
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,039
you can contact me.

355
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,919
I'm not into that kind of thing.

356
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,480
I mean,

357
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,960
if you

358
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,600
is curious

359
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,519
about your husband's whereabouts,

360
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,480
you can add me on WeChat.

361
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,919
I don't need it.

362
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,560
Keep it anyway.

363
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,679
It might come in handy.

364
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,519
It's delicious.

365
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,440
I was just wondering

366
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,600
what to have for lunch.

367
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,960
And then you brought it to me.

368
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,480
Such a great bestie!

369
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,519
Of course!

370
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,720
If your place were closer to our office,

371
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,759
that'd be great.

372
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,759
I could come over

373
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,919
for meals every day.

374
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,720
Nice wish.

375
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,039
I still have to work.

376
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,120
By the way,

377
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,399
how's your work going?

378
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,320
Are you adjusting well?

379
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,320
Pretty good!

380
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Even though I do some

381
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,399
tedious tasks every day,

382
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,720
I feel fulfilled.

383
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,360
After being away from work for so long,

384
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,560
I have to start from the bottom.

385
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,240
Anyone bullies you?

386
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,039
No.

387
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,759
Everyone's been nice to me.

388
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,480
That's a relief.

389
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,039
Does Yu Hai know?

390
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,120
Yes.

391
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,320
He took Huang Sisi

392
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,560
to look at houses that day.

393
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,440
And he even

394
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,039
made a scene with me

395
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,519
How dare he!

396
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,720
He's been house-hunting with Huang Sisi

397
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,879
and still causes trouble with you?

398
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,120
What does he want?

399
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,159
He's gotten so full of himself.

400
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,480
It must be

401
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:27,759
suffocating for you.

402
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,719
Did you do it on purpose?

403
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,280
What do you mean?

404
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:51,719
I was just out for a meal,

405
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,159
and you sent the project plan

406
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:53,639
with the base price

407
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,840
to the client group.

408
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,800
What were you trying to do?

409
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,479
Director Xu,

410
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,719
I didn't know that.

411
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,120
I can't retract it now.

412
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,399
Do you know

413
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:03,959
the whole company is waiting for it

414
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,159
to get paid next month?

415
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,399
Director Xu, I'm really sorry.

416
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:08,719
I won't make the mistake again.

417
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,919
Again?

418
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,000
Rachel will make sure

419
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,080
you remember this forever.

420
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,520
Mu,

421
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,280
sort out the resources

422
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,280
and come to my office.

423
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:25,719
Sit down.

424
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,760
Yes.

425
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,760
We'll increase service items

426
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,919
within the cooperation framework.

427
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:42,840
Or how about

428
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,399
we offer you a new proposal?

429
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,719
Is that okay?

430
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,479
Alright, thank you!

431
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,040
Goodbye.

432
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,600
Adding services items

433
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,719
and extending service time.

434
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,159
Isn't that just a loss?

435
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:05,199
Take an extra shift

436
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,439
to make a new proposal.

437
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,679
You follow up

438
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:09,800
on this project.

439
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,560
Put aside profits for now,

440
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,560
focus on retaining the client first.

441
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,479
What about Yu?

442
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:17,719
Ignore him!

443
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,639
He's upset

444
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,760
because he wasn't laid off?

445
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,000
How could I make

446
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,199
such a rookie mistake?

447
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,399
What should we do?

448
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,879
Since this has happened,

449
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,120
don't dwell on it.

450
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,159
Let's think together

451
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:35,479
about how to resolve the issue.

452
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:38,600
Think about it.

453
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,080
How about

454
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,760
I'll pay for it.

455
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,520
How much do you make a month?

456
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,479
Can you afford it?

457
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,840
The company is laying people off now.

458
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,679
And I make such a rookie mistake

459
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,600
at this critical moment,

460
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
I'll definitely get laid off.

461
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,520
It's so hard to find a job right now.

462
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,639
If I get laid off,

463
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,199
how will I pay rent next month?

464
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,520
Mu,

465
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:55,639
how about

466
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,479
you go talk to Director Xu again?

467
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,919
If it wasn't for the layoffs,

468
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,600
short-staffed and overloaded,

469
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,320
Yu wouldn't have

470
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
made such a rookie mistake.

471
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,439
Let's wait for the result.

472
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,439
Director Xu

473
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,719
has already gone to talk to Rachel.

474
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,600
Went to Rachel?

475
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,679
It's over.

476
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,040
I'm definitely getting fired.

477
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,760
Director Xu said Rachel

478
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,919
will make I remember this forever.

479
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,120
I'm doomed.

480
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,120
Yu, don't be like this.

481
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,959
Let's wait for the result, okay?

482
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,520
It might not be you.

483
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,360
It might not be you.

484
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,840
So,

485
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,040
no bonus this month,

486
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,679
right?

487
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,919
Forget the bonus for now.

488
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,080
I came to see you

489
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,959
mainly because I think

490
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,320
this matter

491
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,120
deserves a penalty,

492
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,760
but can you make it a lighter one?

493
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,159
No way!

494
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,479
I lost my bonus,

495
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,679
yet you want me to go easy?

496
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,199
The stuff you sent

497
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,679
can make up my bonus?

498
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,840
If you go hard on him,

499
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,120
we'll lose another person!

500
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,120
We just had layoffs

501
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,800
and we're short-staffed.

502
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,080
If you kick out another one,

503
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,479
forget the bonus next month,

504
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,959
as we might not even get paid.

505
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,879
It's not up to me.

506
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,199
You're in charge of HR.

507
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,959
How could it not be your call?

508
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,080
I only handle the result.

509
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,360
Regardless of Yu's mistake now.

510
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,639
The loss he caused

511
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:25,479
is up to Mr. Zhou to calculate.

512
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:27,040
If Mr. Zhou knows,

513
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,080
Mr. Zhang must know too.

514
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
You know it well,

515
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,719
he's not on our side.

516
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,040
Why don't you talk to Mr. Zhou?

517
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,879
Better forget it.

518
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,360
Anyway, no matter what,

519
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,800
when it gets to you,

520
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,959
make sure to keep my people.

521
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,399
I'm leaving.

522
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,639
Wait.

523
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,239
Your health report.

524
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,040
It's been here for two months.

525
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,719
And you didn't come to get it.

526
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,919
I really forgot.

527
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,919
These checkups

528
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,199
are just formalities, right?

529
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,120
A formality still takes blood.

530
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,040
The calories are a bit high.

531
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,439
What's wrong?

532
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:17,120
It says I have a hormonal imbalance.

533
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,600
I really didn't get my period this month.

534
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,560
Could it be menopause?

535
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,879
Or a second pregnancy?

536
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,239
Menopause sounds better.

537
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:29,120
Let me tell you,

538
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:30,679
It's early menopause.

539
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,800
What's early menopause?

540
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,040
Look it up yourself.

541
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,639
This looks good.

542
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:38,919
That's fine too.

543
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,600
Hey, aren't you giving them to me?

544
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,320
Stingy.

545
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,159
Insomnia.

546
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,399
Of course.

547
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,760
Night sweats.

548
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,679
Night sweats?

549
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,040
Nope.

550
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,760
Anxiety, definitely.

551
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:13,199
Irritability.

552
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,320
Absolutely.

553
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,719
Who isn't irritable at such an age?

554
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,040
Scientific term.

555
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,399
Menopause.

556
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,600
Menopause?

557
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,159
What day last month?

558
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,520
Milk.

559
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,879
I don't drink it.

560
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,040
What day?

561
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,959
What are you reading?

562
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,679
Menopause?

563
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,360
Why are you reading about menopause?

564
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,399
How could you

565
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:43,479
be going through menopause now?

566
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:44,520
Don't touch me.

567
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,600
So annoying.

568
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,560
Got your period?

569
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,600
I'm checking for menopause.

570
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,040
And you're asking about my period?

571
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,239
Are you doing this on purpose?

572
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:55,879
Guess you don't care me anymore.

573
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,600
Let me tell you,

574
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:58,760
if my days

575
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,600
are over,

576
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,639
so are your good days.

577
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Throwing a fit?

578
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,199
What's going on? Let me see.

579
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,399
Everything looks fine.

580
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,320
Where did you go?

581
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,239
I went to buy medicine.

582
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,199
So hurtful.

583
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,760
Hurtful?

584
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,320
Hurt who?

585
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,199
I just got diagnosed with early menopause,

586
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,280
and you went to buy me medicine.

587
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,320
Let me tell you, Li Lin,

588
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,320
even if I am going through menopause,

589
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,959
only a doctor can prescribe my medicine.

590
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,320
Not you buying it randomly.

591
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,080
No, I didn't buy randomly.

592
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,879
And it's not

593
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,040
menopause medicine.

594
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,000
You vomited,

595
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,520
you might've overeaten.

596
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:33,199
Try some digestive tablets.

597
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,199
If it gets worse,

598
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,000
it might be poor digestive motility.

599
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,360
Try Motilium to help.

600
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,399
When you were brushing your teeth,

601
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,159
you gagged.

602
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,800
80% chance

603
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,719
it's pharyngitis.

604
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,280
Try some pharyngitis tablets.

605
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,639
At worst,

606
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:47,719
it could be pregnancy.

607
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,800
Take a test.

608
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,600
I just found out I'm in menopause

609
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,199
and you're telling me it's pregnancy?

610
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,360
Mocking me?

611
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,879
No, I'm not.

612
00:25:58,879 --> 00:25:59,760
The health report

613
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,719
doesn't say anything about you.

614
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,679
Don't

615
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,560
dig yourself into a hole.

616
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,760
You mean I'm being dramatic.

617
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,199
Don't act like you're in menopause,

618
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:06,719
okay?

619
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,760
Act?

620
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,000
No.

621
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:10,919
No, no.

622
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,159
I'm in menopause.

623
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,080
I'm in menopause.

624
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,760
Get away.

625
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:14,840
Meng'an,

626
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:15,439
I...

627
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,239
Get away!

628
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,719
Okay, okay, move aside.

629
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,520
Those who go through menopause

630
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,040
have their husbands care.

631
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
I'm in menopause now,

632
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,919
and you said I'm acting.

633
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,719
Do I need to do that?

634
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,399
Okay, okay.

635
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:31,199
I'll comfort you.

636
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:31,959
I'm here to comfort you.

637
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:32,719
Get away from me.

638
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:33,600
Meng'an

639
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,560
Get away!

640
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,600
I'm trying to comfort you.

641
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:36,520
Back off.

642
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,600
Alright, alright.

643
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,399
I'm leaving now.

644
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,320
I'm rolling to you.

645
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,760
Hey, stop!

646
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,040
What are you doing?

647
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,520
Alright, you're

648
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,800
not in menopause.

649
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,560
Besides,

650
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,719
our married life

651
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,639
is pretty harmonious.

652
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,159
Just shut up!

653
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,280
Okay, I'll be quiet.

654
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,239
What have I done to deserve this?

655
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,560
Congratulations!

656
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,399
You're pregnant!

657
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,280
I guessed it!

658
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,360
Let's start with an ultrasound

659
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,199
to check it out.

660
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,800
There's already a heartbeat.

661
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,879
Look.

662
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,679
Right here.

663
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,239
Well.

664
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,360
Can I still have a baby?

665
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,320
Why not?

666
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:45,919
Don't you want it?

667
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,600
It

668
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,479
was unexpected.

669
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:55,919
Getting pregnant now

670
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,280
shows you're in great health!

671
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:58,679
Let me tell you,

672
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
a lot of people these days

673
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,080
have to go through IVF,

674
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,120
and it's a struggle for them to conceive.

675
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
But you got pregnant naturally!

676
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:05,879
At your age,

677
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,600
it's kind of like the last chance.

678
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,800
Go home and talk it over

679
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,919
with your husband.

680
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,919
Think about it carefully.

681
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,560
Hello?

682
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:17,479
Hello?

683
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,120
Yunjie is almost done with class here.

684
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Where are you?

685
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,320
Well,

686
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,600
I... I'm still at the hospital.

687
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,320
I still have to

688
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,360
go back to the office for overtime.

689
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,040
You take her to my parents first.

690
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
What did the doctor say?

691
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,199
Just

692
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
a common issue.

693
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,919
We'll talk about it at home.

694
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,000
I told you,

695
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,159
it's definitely not menopause.

696
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,120
You're just overworked.

697
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,520
Later, let

698
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,719
brother-in-law

699
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,199
prescribe some herbal medicine for you.

700
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,719
No, no, no need.

701
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:49,760
By the way,

702
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
did you tell the teacher

703
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,360
about stopping Yunjie's piano lessons?

704
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:57,560
Not yet.

705
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,120
Make sure to tell them.

706
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:02,600
Okay.

707
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:15,879
Yunjie,

708
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,800
for this piece,

709
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,120
we need to handle the staccato

710
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,320
and legato properly.

711
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Practice it more

712
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,320
when you get home.

713
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:24,360
Mr. Li,

714
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:25,639
Yunjie played

715
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:26,520
very well today.

716
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,560
Just keep practicing

717
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,399
at home

718
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,360
and she'll be ready

719
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,399
for the exam.

720
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,320
Ms. Huang,

721
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,479
I'd like to finish the lessons

722
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:33,320
for this month

723
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,360
and then stop for a while.

724
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,800
I'm in my third year of middle school,

725
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,040
and I don't have time to practice.

726
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,560
So, you're not signing up for this exam?

727
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,560
That's right.

728
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,679
Yunjie,

729
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:44,560
who told you to stop classes?

730
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,479
Playing the piano is

731
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,719
something you love!

732
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,560
You shouldn't give it up!

733
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,280
I'm not giving up.

734
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,959
I just don't want to take the exam.

735
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,040
Besides,

736
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,479
I'm not going professional,

737
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:56,479
I can just play at home

738
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,520
for fun.

739
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm in my final year of middle school,

740
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,040
and I don't have much time for it.

741
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:02,879
How about

742
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,239
after my high school entrance exams,

743
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,120
I'll come back for lessons if I have time?

744
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,159
That's really a pity.

745
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,879
We've prepared for so long.

746
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,840
Mr. Li,

747
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,439
is this

748
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,520
your family's decision too?

749
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,800
Thank you.

750
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,719
Your yard

751
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:25,199
is really nice.

752
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:25,800
Really?

753
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,360
This yard is

754
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,320
much bigger than before, isn't it?

755
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,520
Of course.

756
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,439
See

757
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,520
our old house?

758
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,360
After living there for so long,

759
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,320
we got attached and didn't want to move.

760
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,239
So my second daughter and her husband

761
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,600
bought this yard as well.

762
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,399
After connecting them, it's bigger.

763
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,280
That's true.

764
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,560
Your second daughter

765
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,719
bought herself a villa

766
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,280
and got you a house too?

767
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,239
I'm so jealous.

768
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,520
You raised two great daughters

769
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,959
and got two good sons-in-law.

770
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:55,840
Lining,

771
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,040
I remember

772
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,760
at your younger daughter's wedding,

773
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,719
I always thought

774
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,959
she's so pretty

775
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:01,800
but married

776
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,919
such an ordinary guy.

777
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,080
Turns out he's wealthy!

778
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,600
That's not fair.

779
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:07,600
Let me tell you,

780
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,520
when Mengxin got married,

781
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,600
my second son-in-law

782
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,879
had nothing.

783
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,280
No looks,

784
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,560
no money, no education.

785
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,959
But my

786
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,479
elder son-in-law was a graduate.

787
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:20,479
After Mengxin got married,

788
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,959
they two worked hard together,

789
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,320
and their life just

790
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
kept getting better.

791
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,120
I've realized

792
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,040
my daughter brings luck to her husband.

793
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,879
Oh, that's true!

794
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,399
Yes, yes, brings luck!

795
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:32,159
Mom, Dad.

796
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:34,520
Look, here they come!

797
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,479
Auntie.

798
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:37,879
So many people! Go ahead and chat.

799
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,639
Alright.

800
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:39,159
Mom,

801
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,719
I'm not eating at home.

802
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,919
I have a meeting later.

803
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,520
Mengxin bought all of them.

804
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,959
Hello, Aunties.

805
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,520
There's more in the car. I'll get them.

806
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,439
Share with you all.

807
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:49,760
Great, thanks!

808
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,280
I'll go get it.

809
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,719
See, my son-in-law,

810
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,360
whenever he comes back,

811
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,760
never comes empty-handed.

812
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,879
Always with big and small packs,

813
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:56,719
and

814
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,040
always well prepared!

815
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,320
You're really living the life!

816
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm so envious.

817
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,199
We're just an ordinary family.

818
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,120
Oh, come on.

819
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,360
Yunjie,

820
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,399
when you see your grandparents,

821
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,760
don't mention anything

822
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,719
about our family.

823
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,080
Because

824
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,120
it won't solve anything

825
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,959
but only make them worry, right?

826
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Okay, got it.

827
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,600
Don't worry.

828
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,719
Good girl.

829
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,959
Auntie's here!

830
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,120
Lin,

831
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,560
what a coincidence!

832
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:30,919
Quick,

833
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,719
give me a hand.

834
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:32,719
I bought these.

835
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,199
You bought them all.

836
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,520
I can't carry so much, Lin.

837
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,319
Come on, help me out.

838
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:37,839
So much stuff!

839
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,359
How much did you buy?

840
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,120
What do you mean by that?

841
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,359
I bought these.

842
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,920
And you bought those.

843
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,960
I brought some wine.

844
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,560
Enjoy a couple of drinks

845
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,520
with Dad at lunch.

846
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,480
Wait, it's too much.

847
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,920
I can't carry it all, Lin.

848
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,279
You sure know how to show off.

849
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I bought these.

850
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,120
And you bought those.

851
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
All from you, Lin.

852
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,839
Don't say anything like

853
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,239
I bought them all.

854
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,359
Mom.

855
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,239
Lin is here.

856
00:34:59,239 --> 00:34:59,679
Mom.

857
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,480
You're here.

858
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,960
Where is Meng'an?

859
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,279
She's working overtime today.

860
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,319
Lin, you came just in time.

861
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:09,040
I was about to ask,

862
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,159
when are you moving

863
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,040
into that riverside apartment?

864
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,960
I'm off.

865
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,199
It'll be ready in six months.

866
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,199
You know?

867
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
The riverside apartment he bought

868
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,080
is gorgeous!

869
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,040
And it's close to here,

870
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,080
just a five-minute walk.

871
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,359
If I bring hot soup over,

872
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:27,560
it won't even get cold.

873
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,159
That's great.

874
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:28,719
Lining,

875
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,159
you're so lucky.

876
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:31,040
Not like me.

877
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,759
I still have to pay for my son's house.

878
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,600
Having daughters is better.

879
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,920
Yeah.

880
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
two daughters,

881
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,960
one pays,

882
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,120
one helps.

883
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,120
What a happy life!

884
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,040
Exactly.

885
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,279
Why are you standing up?

886
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:45,359
Sit down, come on.

887
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,319
I'm a busy bee.

888
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,400
I still have to go home

889
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
and cook for the kids.

890
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,040
See you.

891
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,679
I wouldn't dare to keep you.

892
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,520
Are you all leaving?

893
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,679
Yes, we're going.

894
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,679
Come visit again.

895
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,279
Sure thing.

896
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,759
Wait, wait!

897
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,120
My son-in-law brought you some gifts.

898
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,199
Just a token, take it.

899
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:01,920
No, no, thanks.

900
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,319
I'm telling you,

901
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
the riverside apartment he bought

902
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,920
is just across from the bus stop.

903
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,080
You can see it clearly.

904
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:10,400
It's really nice.

905
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,600
I have a good eye for it.

906
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:27,279
The size is just perfect.

907
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:28,520
Take another turn and look.

908
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:30,199
Stop.

909
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Your hair

910
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,359
doesn't quite fit.

911
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,400
Your hair is so black and shiny,

912
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
so smooth and thick.

913
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,679
Your phone looks old.

914
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,040
I'll get you a new one.

915
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,520
How about that?

916
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:51,639
No need.

917
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,159
I can't bring it to school anyway.

918
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,920
I can only use it at home after school.

919
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,759
Then I'll buy you a tablet.

920
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,199
You can use this, right?

921
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,359
I already have one.

922
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,040
Yours is old.

923
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,759
I'll get you the latest model.

924
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,279
It's got a huge screen.

925
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,480
For watching movies,

926
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,080
drawing,

927
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,080
and doing homework,

928
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,920
it's really convenient.

929
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,400
How about it?

930
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,199
No need.

931
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,799
Then I'll trade you my piano.

932
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,600
I'm not planning to learn it anymore.

933
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:17,920
Why?

934
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,839
Piano lessons are too expensive.

935
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,279
Each class costs 400 to 500.

936
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,159
So what?

937
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,080
You've been learning for years.

938
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,600
I have the high school entrance exams,

939
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,319
and Piano won't give me extra points.

940
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,520
Xiongxiong can learn.

941
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,759
He's at the perfect age

942
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,199
for it.

943
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,000
So,

944
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:35,920
Xiongxiong,

945
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
come on, say thank you to your sister.

946
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,560
She's giving you the piano!

947
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Sis, please!

948
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,719
I don't want to learn piano!

949
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,040
Here, this is for you.

950
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,719
Keep the piano for yourself.

951
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,639
Naughty kid!

952
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,560
Don't mind him

953
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,920
He's not cut out for the piano anyway.

954
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,319
Seen anything you like lately?

955
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,279
I'll buy it for you.

956
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,279
No need.

957
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,080
You know what?

958
00:37:57,279 --> 00:37:59,040
I've been selling stuff online lately.

959
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,080
Selling things?

960
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,880
Things you don't need can be sold,

961
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,719
and you can buy too.

962
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,880
It's quite a deal.

963
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,480
I've swapped for some good stuff.

964
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,920
Are you short of pocket money?

965
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,759
Tell me,

966
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,560
and I'll give you some.

967
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,679
No.

968
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,839
We have too much stuff at home.

969
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:13,960
So I sell them online.

970
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,719
Does your mom

971
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,719
know about this?

972
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,839
Of course.

973
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:18,960
Auntie,

974
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,040
do you have anything to sell?

975
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,440
I can

976
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,279
help you sell it.

977
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,600
No, I' m not selling anything.

978
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,920
I couldn't part

979
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,040
with my treasures.

980
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,520
At first, I was reluctant too,

981
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,040
but then I thought,

982
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,120
if I can help my mom make some money,

983
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,319
I'm happy.

984
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,400
I'll show you.

985
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,719
These are all things I've swapped.

986
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:38,080
See for yourself.

987
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,040
Mr. Xiao,

988
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,319
are you satisfied

989
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:54,199
with our new proposal?

990
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,279
I can assure you,

991
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:57,440
within the provided budget,

992
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,639
we will

993
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,600
offer you the most comprehensive

994
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,120
digital marketing services.

995
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,040
This price

996
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,400
is a bit surprising.

997
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,159
With this quote,

998
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,040
how much did you use

999
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,920
to earn from us?

1000
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,279
Not really.

1001
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,279
You know

1002
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:14,120
how the market is nowadays.

1003
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,080
Even our suppliers have cut prices,

1004
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,520
so we can't

1005
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
overcharge you.

1006
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Don't you agree?

1007
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,239
Alright, Meng'an,

1008
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,880
let's go with this new proposal.

1009
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,319
In the future,

1010
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:25,960
our products should follow this pricing.

1011
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
We'll see then.

1012
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,799
If prices go up,

1013
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,279
we can't do business

1014
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:31,319
with you at a loss,

1015
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,120
right?

1016
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,520
Alright, that's settled.

1017
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,040
Meeting adjourned.

1018
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:34,520
Okay,

1019
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,400
goodbye.

1020
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,359
If it weren't for you,

1021
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,719
we wouldn't need to work extra hours.

1022
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,159
And I wouldn't have to lie to people.

1023
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,159
Now Mu is in charge

1024
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,080
of this project,

1025
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
so learn from him

1026
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,960
and don't make such mistakes again.

1027
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,279
It's not about getting credit,

1028
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:00,040
it's about not making mistakes,

1029
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,719
especially such basic ones.

1030
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,719
Got it?

1031
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,719
This is too short, isn't it?

1032
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,159
Not at all.

1033
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,759
With this batwing sleeve design,

1034
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:15,440
if you think it's too short...

1035
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,639
It shows the waist.

1036
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,560
Wear a high-waisted skirt

1037
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,799
or pants underneath.

1038
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,880
That'll cover it up.

1039
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
But does your mom even have a waist

1040
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,679
for that high-waisted skirt or pants?

1041
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,719
This design looks nice.

1042
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,480
See the batwing sleeves?

1043
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,120
And the color

1044
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,080
makes your skin look so fair and youthful.

1045
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,639
It's great.

1046
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,920
Yeah, yeah, the color is youthful,

1047
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,520
but your mom is old.

1048
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,080
Old?

1049
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,159
Are you kidding?

1050
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:35,920
Not old at all.

1051
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,880
This one, you'll surely like.

1052
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,520
It's pleated,

1053
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,080
see?

1054
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,040
It's a bit longer.

1055
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:41,839
This can go with anything.

1056
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,000
Black or white, you name it.

1057
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,679
Right?

1058
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,799
This one's okay.

1059
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:46,960
Long enough.

1060
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,080
Only care about the length.

1061
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,799
Check them out later.

1062
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:50,560
I bought you so many.

1063
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,639
You can mix and match them yourself,

1064
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,359
okay?

1065
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,159
Alright.

1066
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:54,880
But you're

1067
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,560
spending money too recklessly.

1068
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,319
Bought so much stuff.

1069
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:58,199
Buying things for you

1070
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,719
isn't wasting money at all.

1071
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,239
Spending money is how you make money.

1072
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,040
Alright, alright.

1073
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,960
Everything you bought looks great.

1074
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:06,759
Let me ask you something.

1075
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,199
How much did my sister borrow

1076
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,080
for that house they bought?

1077
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:14,520
I heard they borrowed a lot.

1078
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:16,040
She's paying back

1079
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,759
tens of thousands each month.

1080
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,319
You see,

1081
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,759
now she works overtime every weekend.

1082
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,480
It's too much pressure.

1083
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,319
Did something happen

1084
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,679
with them?

1085
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,920
Do you know?

1086
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,000
No, I don't.

1087
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,440
But I saw Yunjie

1088
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,719
selling stuff

1089
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:33,679
on a phone app.

1090
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,679
Selling their home stuff,

1091
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,520
I feel like something's not right.

1092
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,040
Wait,

1093
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,679
selling their home stuff?

1094
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,400
You remind me something.

1095
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,960
You know, Lin

1096
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,359
used to be so busy with work,

1097
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,520
he often had no time to pick up Yunjie,

1098
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,880
and he'd ask me and your dad

1099
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,040
to pick her.

1100
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:54,960
But it's been a while.

1101
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,120
He doesn't need us to pick her up anymore.

1102
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,799
He goes to pick up the kid from school

1103
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,520
in the afternoon.

1104
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:01,799
Also,

1105
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:05,279
once your dad said

1106
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:06,279
he saw him

1107
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:07,960
at the supermarket

1108
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,480
fighting over discounted groceries.

1109
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,080
So your dad thought

1110
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,880
to check

1111
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,719
if something was up.

1112
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,120
He didn't say anything.

1113
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:20,920
And you see,

1114
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,520
they two don't say anything.

1115
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,400
We don't want to pry.

1116
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,040
Then I'll ask my sister.

1117
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,759
Don't go.

1118
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:28,600
You know

1119
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,799
how your sister is.

1120
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,159
She's quite touchy about her pride.

1121
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,920
Your dad and I

1122
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,319
decided

1123
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,199
that regardless of what's going on,

1124
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,120
we'll support her.

1125
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,199
So how do we support her?

1126
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,960
Flip it.

1127
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,440
Go ahead.

1128
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,279
Guess the lid.

1129
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:45,080
Why guess the lid?

1130
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,880
We have to guess it.

1131
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,319
We need to know who goes first.

1132
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,799
How many rounds and wins?

1133
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,080
Just one round, done.

1134
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,199
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1135
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:52,400
I'll go first.

1136
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,040
Let's settle the rules first, Dad.

1137
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
The flag can only be carried by sappers.

1138
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,560
You novice.

1139
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,319
You think you can

1140
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,319
beat an old hand like me?

1141
00:42:59,319 --> 00:42:59,880
Come on.

1142
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,600
Let's go.

1143
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,120
What's the point of all this talk?

1144
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:02,759
Look.

1145
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,799
Heavenly fire burns the ice cellar.

1146
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:13,080
Blow up your commander.

1147
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,400
I have such bad luck.

1148
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,520
I died as soon as I flipped.

1149
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,319
Bad luck.

1150
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:21,480
How much are eggs per catty

1151
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
at the supermarket now?

1152
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:24,600
The cheapest

1153
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,319
5.98.

1154
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:26,600
How much?

1155
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,279
5.98.

1156
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,920
I bought them more expensive.

1157
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
They were over 7.

1158
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,319
You must have gone at the wrong time.

1159
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:36,679
What's the right time?

1160
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:38,239
When the supermarket opens

1161
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:38,880
in the morning.

1162
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,359
At 9:00 AM.

1163
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,480
Dad, let me tell you,

1164
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM,

1165
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,400
just half an hour.

1166
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,920
That's when it's 5.98.

1167
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:45,239
A special offer.

1168
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,679
So?

1169
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
I went too late.

1170
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
I... I...

1171
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,080
I didn't know before.

1172
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,719
It was

1173
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,799
just a coincidence.

1174
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,279
I was passing by the supermarket

1175
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:57,080
on my way to work.

1176
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,839
That's how I knew

1177
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,880
it was 5.98.

1178
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,880
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known.

1179
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,520
How's your business

1180
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,480
going

1181
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,279
with your boss?

1182
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:04,440
Not bad.

1183
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,400
Opened the market?

1184
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,400
It's ongoing.

1185
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:09,799
Wait.

1186
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:11,319
Aren't you in research?

1187
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,319
Why are you dealing with the market?

1188
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,319
Well,

1189
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,159
Dad,

1190
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,520
didn't I tell you that day?

1191
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:19,799
The boss asked me to handle it,

1192
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:20,600
so I had to do it.

1193
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,279
They said getting familiar with the market

1194
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,199
would help with the business.

1195
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:25,920
What about the design part?

1196
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,799
Don't you care?

1197
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,600
I do care.

1198
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:29,239
Of course.
