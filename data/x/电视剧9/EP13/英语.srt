English subtitles are available

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:48,480
Just in Time EP13

3
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,439
Have these items gone moldy?

4
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:51,839
If not, why display them in the sun?

5
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:56,999
Hey, where are you going?

6
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:57,719
Put them here.

7
00:01:58,919 --> 00:01:59,919
Today's a nice day,

8
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,719
making it perfect to

9
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,160
display them.

10
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Fruits

11
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,040
spoil fast.

12
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,639
I assumed you don't know that.

13
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:12,760
Dad,

14
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,240
the turtle is missing.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
I'll buy you five more.

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,879
Buy them in pairs.

17
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,080
Okay.

18
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,960
Where's Yunjie?

19
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:26,999
Where's Yunjie?

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,120
She was just here.

21
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,120
Mom.

22
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,400
Mom.

23
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,640
What happened to you?

24
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,159
Yunjie, you're back.

25
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,240
Are you alright?

26
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm fine.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,640
Where's dad?

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,599
I'm here.

29
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,039
Yunjie, you're back.

30
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
Where have you been?

31
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,039
What's so important?

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,120
Mom gets sick,

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,080
you should look after her.

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,319
In usual,

35
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,920
you are attentive, yet now

36
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,520
mom doesn't even get a glass of water.

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,999
I'm so disappointed in you.

38
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,920
I...

39
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,080
He is also feeling unwell.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm actually sick too.

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,039
You're sick too?

42
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:12,360
No touch.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,120
It's contagious.

44
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:13,999
Keep your distance.

45
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,520
Then why are you standing here?

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,400
Go lie down.

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,319
I...

48
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:17,920
Hurry up.

49
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,960
Come here.

50
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,800
Just do as she says.

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,599
Fine, I'll

52
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,200
lie down.

53
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,039
Tuck in the quilt

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,319
like mom does.

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,240
You two

56
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,559
are adults.

57
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,039
how come you can't look after yourselves?

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,240
When you're not feeling well,

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,400
you should rest in bed.

60
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,120
Good thing I'm back.

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,279
I can take care of you both.

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
I'm off to buy rice soup and medicine.

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,719
You two get some rest.

64
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,360
Don't move.

65
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,640
It's too much to worry about.

66
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,879
You're really sick, huh?

67
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,519
Dr. Yu.

68
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,079
Ms. Chen.

69
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,160
This is for you.

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,559
Rice soup again?

71
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,519
No, it's noodles.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
You have low blood sugar,

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,399
so this is good for you.

74
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,319
Sorry for always

75
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,399
troubling you.

76
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:46,879
Never mind.

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,959
When I was little

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,800
my grandpa would make me noodles

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,840
whenever I felt unwell,

80
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
and I'd feel better.

81
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,319
Okay,

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,360
thank you.

83
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:52,879
Okay.

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,319
Well,

85
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,240
I'll leave you alone.

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm leaving.

87
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,199
Bye.

88
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,079
Is it not good?

89
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,920
It's good.

90
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,840
Yummy.

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,999
It's just not mealtime yet.

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,920
Yeah.

93
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,079
So you don't want it now?

94
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,399
Of course I do.

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Alright, give it to me.

96
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,040
Give it to me.

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,600
There's medicine over there.

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,199
I bought it.

99
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,399
Remember to take it later.

100
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,759
Your mom doesn't need it.

101
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,559
Why?

102
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,240
She already took hers,

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,639
for 12 hours.

104
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:56,680
What about you?

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,399
I'll take the medicine.

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,040
I can take it.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
Though my cold symptoms are mild,

108
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,720
I still need the medicine.

109
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:03,519
Right?

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,319
Yeah.

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,280
Remember to take it later.

112
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,639
What should we do?

113
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,120
We'll just lie here?

114
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,280
I have to keep lying here.

115
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,360
What about me?

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
You just

117
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,040
lie down with me for a bit.

118
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,720
Alright,

119
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,519
I'll lie down for a bit.

120
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,360
Good.

121
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,399
Our daughter bought us rice soup.

122
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,959
Yeah.

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,759
Yet it would be better

124
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,800
with some pickles.

125
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:58,999
Don't move.

126
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,840
Stay here.

127
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,720
I'll go check.

128
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,720
So heavy.

129
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:09,840
So much stuff.

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,240
Yunjie,

131
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,720
let me do it.

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,480
Stop it.

133
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,360
You stop it.

134
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,759
Go.

135
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,280
Get your rest.

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,319
Do you know

137
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,199
how to do it?

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,280
You're in the kitchen.

139
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,879
I'll find out once I put them away.

140
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,680
I don't get it.

141
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,559
Why did you buy so much?

142
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,879
For eating.

143
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,399
Can you finish all this?

144
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,600
Your mom

145
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,759
is sick, right?

146
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
Doesn't she need to eat

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
more nutritious food?

148
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,519
Sick people should eat light.

149
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,360
Look at what you bought:

150
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,680
luncheon meat

151
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,399
and

152
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,160
ham sausages.

153
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,680
I can eat them.

154
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,840
No, I'm sick too.

155
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,959
I'm sick too.

156
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,319
I need nutrition as well.

157
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,120
And there are these

158
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,240
big cherries.

159
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,439
Why didn't I have them when I was sick?

160
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,319
You...

161
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,120
You can eat them whenever you like.

162
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,079
Since you're back,

163
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,360
you can eat them now.

164
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,160
Come on.

165
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:58,999
Stay back.

166
00:07:59,639 --> 00:07:59,920
Stay back.

167
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,519
Go rest.

168
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,959
The kitchen is my domain.

169
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,600
I won't let you do this.

170
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,879
Just do as I say.

171
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
No, you do as I say.

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm your dad.

173
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,240
But you're sick now.

174
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,879
Do as I tell you,

175
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,680
and go rest.

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,720
Do you think

177
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,800
you've grown up?

178
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,519
Do you think you...

179
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,559
You...

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,360
Who's there?

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
I'll talk to you later.

182
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,199
Lanxiang,

183
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,160
why are you here?

184
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,959
To check on you.

185
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,519
This must be Yunjie.

186
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,120
Look how tall she's gotten.

187
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,559
Yunjie,

188
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,920
this is your aunt.

189
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:37,759
Which aunt?

190
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,320
I cared for you when you were 1-3 years old.

191
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,519
Don't you remember?

192
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,159
Right,

193
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,560
your aunt Lanxiang.

194
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,560
Hi, aunt Lanxiang.

195
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,560
Hi, aunt...

196
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,639
Please come in, Lanxiang.

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,320
Your house hasn't changed.

198
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,679
Where's Meng'an?

199
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,039
My mom's sick.

200
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,360
Sick?

201
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,519
Then I came at the right time.

202
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
Good.

203
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,399
I'm full of joy now.

204
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,679
Finally, I get a chance

205
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,240
to have Meng'an

206
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,200
follow me around for once.

207
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,759
Your sister's had a hard time,

208
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,840
having a second child at her age.

209
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,840
She really has.

210
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,879
What about me?

211
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,159
Since I was little,

212
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,759
I've been eating what she left,

213
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,879
using what she didn't need,

214
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,159
and wearing her hand-me-downs.

215
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:37,919
This time,

216
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm going to

217
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,679
taking revenge.

218
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,399
I always thought you didn't care about it,

219
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,440
I didn't expect you

220
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,560
to be jealous of your own sister.

221
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,039
It's not jealousy.

222
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,519
It's revenge.

223
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,519
I've endured too many

224
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,840
grievances growing up.

225
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,320
Your dad and I

226
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,039
never mistreated you.

227
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,519
All the grievances I've endured

228
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,440
came from my sister

229
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,480
when you and Dad

230
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,759
weren't there for me.

231
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,440
Looking back,

232
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,999
those weren't just grievances.

233
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,360
They were

234
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,200
exploitation,

235
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,120
harassment,

236
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,679
and even bullying.

237
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,519
Otherwise, how would you behave?

238
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,879
True.

239
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,200
I've decided.

240
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,320
Look,

241
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,080
Yunjie is doing a great job

242
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,120
with Xiongxiong.

243
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,279
In the future,

244
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,039
I'll teach

245
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,120
my second child

246
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,560
to take good care of

247
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
my sister's second child.

248
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,240
Wait.

249
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,039
Your second child taking care

250
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,120
of the second child of Meng'an?

251
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,759
That's the strangest prenatal

252
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,720
education I've ever heard.

253
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,600
Yunjie,

254
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,120
I took care of you from age one to three.

255
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,679
You really don't remember me?

256
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,759
I was only three at the time.

257
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,080
How could I remember?

258
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,240
Right.

259
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,840
Your house hasn't changed

260
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
a bit over the years.

261
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,440
Aunt,

262
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,840
we're about to move.

263
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,879
To a big apartment with a river view.

264
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,720
It's so good.

265
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,600
Really?

266
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,799
That's great.

267
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,799
Stop doing that.

268
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,120
Come here

269
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,799
and hand me the stuff.

270
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll organize it.

271
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,080
Okay.

272
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,679
Hey,

273
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,200
give that to me.

274
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,560
Who's here?

275
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,159
I heard Yunjie calling aunt.

276
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,360
Lanxiang,

277
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,519
Lanxiang is here.

278
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,639
Lanxiang?

279
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,279
Didn't we already tell her

280
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,200
not to come?

281
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Why is she here again?

282
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,999
Didn't you call your sister?

283
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,360
I did tell her.

284
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,320
Then how come?

285
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,279
I'll call her again.

286
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,399
Hello?

287
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,519
Hello, Jing.

288
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,999
Lanxiang went to your place?

289
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,879
Yes.

290
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,679
Jing,

291
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,639
didn't my brother-in-law tell you

292
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,159
not to introduce Lanxiang

293
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,120
here?

294
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,360
He said no,

295
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,799
but you didn't say no.

296
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,639
Right?

297
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,799
Meng'an said

298
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,919
she would help.

299
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,519
Let me tell you again.

300
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,960
Mengxin doesn't need

301
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,159
anyone at home.

302
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,440
Well,

303
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,320
how about this?

304
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,480
Let Lanxiang stay here first.

305
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,639
She can look for work slowly.

306
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,240
See?

307
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,519
See? Meng'an knows how to get things done.

308
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,120
Listen,

309
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,360
Lanxiang has had a hard time.

310
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,279
We

311
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,360
should help if we can.

312
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,720
I'll hang up now.

313
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,720
Are you sure to keep her here?

314
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,519
At least for today.

315
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,279
I'll go get ready.

316
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,399
Welcome, Lanxiang.

317
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,120
Meng'an.

318
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,639
Long time no see.

319
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,080
You haven't aged

320
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,399
a bit over the years.

321
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,919
I'm old.

322
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,960
Yunjie is turning 16,

323
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,200
and you must be over 40 by now.

324
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:17,919
Back home,

325
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,440
women your age could be grandmothers

326
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
in just a few more years.

327
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,519
Yet look at you,

328
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,159
still looking so young and beautiful.

329
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,320
What? I'm only 14.

330
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,159
How could mom be close to being a grandmother?

331
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:28,999
Nominal age.

332
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,519
She means in terms of nominal age.

333
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,159
Yes.

334
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,159
I don't like nominal age.

335
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,679
Come on,

336
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,360
have a seat.

337
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,240
Come on,

338
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:35,799
take a seat.

339
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,519
How have you been recently?

340
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,279
What's your plan for coming to Chunjiang?

341
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,799
My son is still in school.

342
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,279
I'm thinking of finding a job

343
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,279
in the city.

344
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I want to check if Mengxin

345
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
is in need of staff.

346
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,360
Xin already

347
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,919
has a driver and nanny.

348
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,799
It's not good for us to intervene.

349
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,279
I thought we can wait

350
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,679
and try to find another

351
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,720
job for you.

352
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,120
Just stay here

353
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
for now.

354
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,279
Aside from

355
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
having a few more items,

356
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,320
our house is unchanged from before.

357
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,879
Work will

358
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,039
come slowly.

359
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,560
Let's find a good one.

360
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,919
Okay.

361
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,480
Meng'an,

362
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,679
you're right.

363
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,080
Thank you.

364
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,240
It's nothing.

365
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,639
Haven't eaten yet?

366
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,639
I'll make dinner.

367
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,279
Hurry up.

368
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:27,639
No.

369
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Lin, stop.

370
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,320
I'll do it.

371
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:30,840
No need.

372
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,039
I'm familiar with your kitchen.

373
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,600
I cook more quickly.

374
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,879
You can just

375
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,919
wait to be served.

376
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,639
Dad,

377
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,240
you're losing your job again.

378
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,799
What do you mean again?

379
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,799
Yunjie,

380
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,720
come here.

381
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,639
I need to tell you something.

382
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,919
What is it?

383
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,840
Let's talk on the bed.

384
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,279
Come.

385
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,120
Sit down.

386
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,519
What's up?

387
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,440
Well,

388
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,320
your aunt Lanxiang

389
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,200
might be staying with us

390
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,360
for a while.

391
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,120
Even though she's

392
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,200
a distant relative,

393
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,799
there are some things

394
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,399
we shouldn't let her know.

395
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,720
Why?

396
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,720
I'm worried

397
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,519
if she knows,

398
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,600
your aunt might know.

399
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,639
And if your aunt knows,

400
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,039
the whole world will know.

401
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,759
It's okay if the whole world knows,

402
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,639
but she'll criticize us,

403
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,159
lecture us,

404
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,440
and regulate us.

405
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,759
Then what

406
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,799
shouldn't she know?

407
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,799
Your dad's unemployment

408
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,039
must not be mentioned.

409
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,639
Okay.

410
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:16,639
And your mom's

411
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,679
situation too.

412
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,639
What about you?

413
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,360
It's just your mom

414
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,600
loves work.

415
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,799
She's ill,

416
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,159
but still working.

417
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,999
We can't let her know.

418
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,519
Also, don't let her know

419
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,519
about my poor exam results.

420
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,399
Definitely.

421
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,240
Anything else

422
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,480
she shouldn't know?

423
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:45,960
Let's think about it.

424
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Yes, let's think.

425
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:47,879
Okay.

426
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:13,639
See?

427
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:14,439
That's the difference

428
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,360
between a pro and an amateur.

429
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,199
Looks like dad still has a lot of room

430
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,399
for improvement.

431
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,919
Plenty of room.

432
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,439
Your dad's

433
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,560
like a mole,

434
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,639
totally out of place.

435
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:25,679
Just go take a rest.

436
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,560
It's okay.

437
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,560
But you can't just abandon him.

438
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,239
You know

439
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,120
aunt Lanxiang can't

440
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,639
stay with us forever.

441
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,520
Still have to depend on your dad in the future.

442
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,080
This smells just like the Chunjiang

443
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,120
fish banquet I had.

444
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,919
Didn't fill up on the rice soup?

445
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,800
But it's mealtime now.

446
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,879
Hurry up.

447
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:13,520
Is it good?

448
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,239
Great.

449
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I'll clean up now.

450
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,919
Stay still,

451
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:20,840
I've got this.

452
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,800
Leave it to me.

453
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,040
I can handle it.

454
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:24,280
Lanxiang,

455
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,479
I can't cook better than you,

456
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:26,520
but I can handle

457
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,360
washing dishes.

458
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,600
As long as I'm here,

459
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:31,239
you won't have to do anything.

460
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,399
Teach me later.

461
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,320
Sure, no problem.

462
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Thanks, aunt.

463
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,080
Trust me.

464
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:39,560
I should

465
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,600
take it to her.

466
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,959
Better not go over there.

467
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,719
Lanxiang came unexpectedly

468
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,679
and feels a bit awkward.

469
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,479
She's working hard

470
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,199
to make

471
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,199
a good impression.

472
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,439
You should understand it.

473
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,159
Agree.

474
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,320
It's time for you to take a break.

475
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,639
After she finds a job,

476
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,120
check

477
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,600
the market rate

478
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,399
and we'll pay her.

479
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,199
It'll be worth

480
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,399
her effort.

481
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,520
Yes.

482
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,159
So, Wanzhen,

483
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,919
are you now

484
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,360
working in real estate sales?

485
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,760
Part-time or full-time?

486
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,840
Full-time.

487
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,639
But I just started.

488
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,239
Grace,

489
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,000
if you want to buy a property,

490
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,040
feel free to contact me.

491
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,320
Actually,

492
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:23,560
recently,

493
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,280
I'm thinking of moving.

494
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:25,919
Really?

495
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:27,800
Pregnant?

496
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,520
Congratulations.

497
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,560
Look.

498
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,639
Check the layout.

499
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:32,280
It's 140 square meters in size.

500
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,239
Perfect for you.

501
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:33,639
Really?

502
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,320
It has reserved space

503
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,479
for a future second child.

504
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,439
Don't say that.

505
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:39,239
A second child?

506
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,120
I'm still struggling with

507
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,159
the first one.

508
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,919
When's your due date?

509
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,360
In three months.

510
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,040
Soon.

511
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,439
Pregnancy is tough.

512
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,159
It turns out you are right.

513
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,000
You know?

514
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,399
Look,

515
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
we're the same age,

516
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,199
and here I am, an elderly pregnancy woman,

517
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,239
while you've had two children,

518
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,080
who are already up now,

519
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,959
freeing you from worry,

520
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,360
allowing you to work with ease.

521
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,840
But I believe your choice is better.

522
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,959
You're a director now,

523
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:05,959
meaning a stable career,

524
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,159
and more security

525
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:07,760
for both the child and yourself

526
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
once the baby is born.

527
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,120
And the pain of giving birth

528
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,959
is nothing compared to

529
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,080
the challenges of raising a child.

530
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,600
To tell you the truth,

531
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm struggling now.

532
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,080
I don't know

533
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,199
what's wrong.

534
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,120
Perhaps it's because I'm getting older.

535
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,600
I feel like I lack energy, always feeling sleepy,

536
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,199
and I can't pull all-nighters anymore.

537
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,959
You're familiar

538
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,000
with our work.

539
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:24,919
Engaging in one project

540
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:25,560
means staying in a hotel

541
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,639
for months.

542
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,560
At the company,

543
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,399
I'm pretty much

544
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:31,879
on the fringe,

545
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,399
no longer a main player,

546
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,560
relegated to a support position.

547
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:35,239
So my husband

548
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,360
often says to me at home,

549
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,000
"For the little money and the work amount

550
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,679
You might as well quit

551
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,000
and stay home raising our kid."

552
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,800
I'm nearly persuaded.

553
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,360
You must stick with it.

554
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,399
I hate to admit it,

555
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,439
but I'm a bad example.

556
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,080
You?

557
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,800
Isn't your husband doing well?

558
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,199
That's my ex-husband.

559
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,639
I'm raising my kids by myself now.

560
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,719
So, you're in sales now.

561
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,239
How did that happen?

562
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,040
So I believe in

563
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,679
taking

564
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,399
control of my own fate.

565
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,159
But it's

566
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,239
not too late now.

567
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:09,520
Alright.

568
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,239
I'll definitely

569
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,760
buy this house from you.

570
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,399
Thanks, Grace.

571
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:15,560
I'll have another look at the manual.

572
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,199
Okay.

573
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,280
Aren't you thinking of

574
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,879
going back to your old field?

575
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,360
I have thought about it,

576
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,080
but I've been

577
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,399
away for so long.

578
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,399
My experience and age

579
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,639
are disadvantages.

580
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,280
I understand.

581
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,120
Mr. Zhou is here. Hi, Mr. Zhou.

582
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:28,959
Hi, Grace.

583
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:29,919
Windy.

584
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,840
Zhou Yao.

585
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,199
Old colleagues' reunion.

586
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:33,320
Indeed.

587
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
You're working now?

588
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:35,840
Are you working here?

589
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,959
No.

590
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:37,879
I'm now

591
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,360
in real estate sales.

592
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,320
Here's our company's brochure.

593
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,360
If you're interested,

594
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,280
take a look.

595
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:44,959
Here's my calling card.

596
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,120
Call me

597
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,000
if you need anything.

598
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,959
I'll read it for sure.

599
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:48,959
I have a meeting,

600
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:49,520
so I got to go now.

601
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,000
Okay, go ahead.

602
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,560
Keep in touch.

603
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:51,399
Okay, bye.

604
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:51,919
Bye.

605
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,120
Alright, I'm leaving.

606
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Take care.

607
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,199
Okay, bye.

608
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:58,639
Bye.

609
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,000
Excuse me.

610
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Enjoy some fruit.

611
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,120
This is Lanxiang.

612
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,840
Wanzhen,

613
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,879
have you met before?

614
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,639
Yes,

615
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,080
when Yunjie was little.

616
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:19,520
Yes.

617
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,159
We've met before.

618
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,199
Yeah.

619
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,320
I think she looks

620
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,479
much better now.

621
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,479
Prettier, isn't she?

622
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,360
Right?

623
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,280
Let me tell you,

624
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,879
she's really impressive now.

625
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,199
Keep it up.

626
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm going to do groceries.

627
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:34,879
Okay.

628
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,560
Have fun.

629
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,760
Why are you

630
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,840
here today?

631
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,639
Slacking off during work hours,

632
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:45,919
that's not like you.

633
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,760
Staying home during work hours

634
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,639
isn't like you either.

635
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,719
Wanna know why?

636
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,679
Yes.

637
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,800
Miscarriage prevention.

638
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:01,280
You've made up your mind?

639
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes, I've decided to keep the baby.

640
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,439
I used to

641
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,879
find a lot of reasons

642
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,239
not to have the baby,

643
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,479
but

644
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:13,879
deep inside,

645
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,040
I still have feelings

646
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,199
for the baby.

647
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,719
But my heart

648
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,239
felt unsettled.

649
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,639
Once I decided to keep it,

650
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,439
I felt so much more at ease.

651
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,080
You get it, right?

652
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,320
Just like when you decided

653
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,159
to divorce.

654
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,800
What did the doctor say?

655
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,239
Just take care of myself.

656
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,520
As an elderly pregnant woman,

657
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,080
I should avoid stress and anger,

658
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,399
and eat more progesterone.

659
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:44,159
I think it will be fine.

660
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,679
I even want to go back to work.

661
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,239
All the reasons given for not having baby

662
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,520
no longer hold water.

663
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:52,040
Now I eat my words.

664
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,280
It tells us that

665
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
in the face of genuine desire,

666
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,919
all external obstacles

667
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,000
are but paper tigers.

668
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,879
You're right.

669
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,320
Alright, let's talk about you.

670
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,199
Did you need something

671
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,159
or just want to chat?

672
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,439
Just to chat with you.

673
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:11,399
Okay.

674
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,679
I was promoting properties

675
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,199
to old colleagues today,

676
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,679
back at where

677
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,560
I used to work.

678
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,080
The financial building

679
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,320
by the river?

680
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,320
Feeling nostalgic?

681
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,520
Seeing old colleagues

682
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,560
as directors

683
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,439
or bosses,

684
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,000
and watching them start new projects

685
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:36,560
and have meetings,

686
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,560
I felt a lot of envy.

687
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:39,840
I really miss

688
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,399
those days in investment banking.

689
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,360
Instead of missing the past,

690
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,199
miss the person you used to be.

691
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:49,959
Yes,

692
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,639
I used to be

693
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,320
so confident,

694
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,360
believing I was the best

695
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,000
investor in the world.

696
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Fresh out of college,

697
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,439
I even fancied myself

698
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,520
becoming the best journalist

699
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,320
in all of China.

700
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,040
Everyone has dreams after all.

701
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,800
Do you think I still

702
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,600
have a chance to return to

703
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,520
the investment industry?

704
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:12,959
Would you like to return?

705
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,679
Yes.

706
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,840
Then go for it.

707
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,560
But the finance industry

708
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,199
is so competitive now.

709
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,800
Even top graduates

710
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,879
struggle to find jobs.

711
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,159
Me,

712
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,120
after being away for so many years,

713
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,760
even if an opportunity comes,

714
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,080
I might not catch it.

715
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't agree.

716
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,159
If the opportunity

717
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,040
does come,

718
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,320
you have to do your utmost

719
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,959
to grab it.

720
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,320
You studied

721
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
in this major

722
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,919
with a master's degree,

723
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,639
plus five or six years of experience.

724
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,919
You're

725
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,239
qualified.

726
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,360
It's true,

727
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,199
but others are qualified too.

728
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,840
And they're younger.

729
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,360
True.

730
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,639
Your industry

731
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,520
has a high entry barrier.

732
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,919
Those who can enter

733
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,719
have similar

734
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:01,919
skill levels.

735
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,239
So, compete on your soft skills:

736
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,399
execution,

737
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:07,439
management,

738
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,439
stress handling,

739
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,399
and coordination.

740
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,120
You're already divorced.

741
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,719
Don't you already have those skills?

742
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,280
Don't doubt me.

743
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,159
Really.

744
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,239
If you think

745
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,760
I'm like a female warrior,

746
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,399
then let me ask you,

747
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,080
are female warriors' friends

748
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,879
weaklings?

749
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Of course not.

750
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,600
Meng'an,

751
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
you're really my energy booster.

752
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:37,320
Here are my antennas.

753
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,320
Chatting with you

754
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,040
when I'm down

755
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,000
makes me enlightened.

756
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,399
How do you cultivate?

757
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:45,399
Cultivate?

758
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
By self-acceptance.

759
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Do you know the biggest difference

760
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,840
between us and younger generation?

761
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,919
Young people

762
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,439
accept themselves reluctantly,

763
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,080
while we accept with pleasure.

764
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Though life is harsh,

765
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,320
we still possess the ability

766
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,639
to face the gifts

767
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,879
it bestows upon us

768
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
with grace.

769
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,000
Quite a journalist,

770
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,080
you're great with words.

771
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:15,879
I'm good at stirring emotions.

772
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,159
Meng'an.

773
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,199
Go for it.

774
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:22,919
I got your back.

775
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,239
It took you for so long.

776
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,199
Mr. Jia,

777
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:44,639
I browsed through the mall.

778
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,760
These two cosmetics

779
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,679
are indisputably

780
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,760
the most luxurious

781
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,840
in the entire mall.

782
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,280
Are these the most expensive?

783
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,360
Definitely.

784
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
You can count on me.

785
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,360
Would you like something to eat?

786
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:53,959
No, thanks.

787
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:54,840
I ran too fast.

788
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,760
Is someone missing me?

789
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,600
Mrs. Jia, hello.

790
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,000
What are you doing here?

791
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,320
Are you interested in your

792
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,520
husband's whereabouts?

793
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,399
No.

794
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,760
Look at this.

795
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,520
These are candid shots

796
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,560
from our external

797
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,639
photographers.

798
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:19,239
It's free.

799
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,159
Take a look.

800
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:26,919
What's this?

801
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,080
It's just my husband shopping.

802
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,560
Toys, bags, and cosmetics.

803
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,919
Why are you taking pictures of these?

804
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,120
Look at this.

805
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:40,199
Two sets of luxury cosmetics.

806
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,760
What wrong about two sets?

807
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,800
One for my face and one for my feet.

808
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,040
Bye, Mrs. Jia.

809
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,639
I'm willing to help

810
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
anytime, anywhere.

811
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,479
Your dad only bought you this?

812
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:56,719
Yeah.

813
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:57,840
What about building blocks?

814
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,439
He didn't buy me building blocks.

815
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:05,040
Mom, look.

816
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,399
I don't have this yellow one,

817
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:07,840
or this red one.

818
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
And this blue one neither.

819
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
It's so cool.

820
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,120
Safe travels.

821
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,639
Okay.

822
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,520
Thanks so much.

823
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800
You did me a favor today.

824
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,679
Thank you.

825
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,520
Let's meet again and talk.

826
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,320
Okay?

827
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,439
Okay.

828
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,560
Take care.

829
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:26,959
Okay.

830
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,040
Bye.

831
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:28,439
Okay.

832
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,040
Honey.

833
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,879
Honey.

834
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:33,800
Take a look

835
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,199
at what I've bought for you.

836
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,919
Luxury face cream.

837
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,040
Use this one in the morning,

838
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
and this one at night.

839
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,360
Shouldn't there be two sets?

840
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:48,239
Honey,

841
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,120
if you like it,

842
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,320
I'll buy another set tomorrow,

843
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,479
one set for your face

844
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,719
and the other for your feet,

845
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:57,919
as long as you like it.

846
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,600
What else?

847
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm such a fool, honey.

848
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,560
My fault, honey.

849
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,520
Let's go shopping

850
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,040
tomorrow.

851
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,800
We'll shop from street to street,

852
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,639
buying from the first store

853
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,800
to the last,

854
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,120
as long as you like it.

855
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,040
Honey,

856
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,760
I was wrong.

857
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm guilty.

858
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,560
I'm sorry.

859
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,760
Mom,

860
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,959
come have breakfast.

861
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,399
Our breakfast is upgraded today,

862
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,919
moved from the usual trio.

863
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,199
What's wrong with the usual trio?

864
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,320
You

865
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,120
used to enjoy them.

866
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,959
But now we have something better.

867
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,959
I need to praise my aunt more

868
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,320
to make you ambitious.

869
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,560
Trying to provoke me, eh?

870
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,040
Don't disparage others.

871
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,560
I learned it from you.

872
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,320
When did I do that?

873
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:59,600
I'm done eating.

874
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,000
I'll bring He Lu a rice cake.

875
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,679
She'll definitely love it.

876
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,159
Do you feel a bit

877
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,600
awkward about

878
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,719
riding their car to school?

879
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,320
I'm riding their car today.

880
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,439
Be careful on the way.

881
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,199
Bye.

882
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:13,840
Yunjie, take it slow.

883
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,639
Bye.

884
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,959
Here, Meng'an,

885
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,800
this is for you.

886
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,520
It's hot.

887
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,399
Thanks.

888
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,600
Leave them here.

889
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,320
Take a seat.

890
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,239
Let's chat.

891
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,639
You made such a great breakfast.

892
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,919
Must got up really early.

893
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,560
I usually wake up early.

894
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:33,840
Let's grab a bite.

895
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,639
Have more.

896
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,520
Meng'an,

897
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
what

898
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,800
exactly is wrong with you?

899
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,439
When I worked

900
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,439
at the home service company,

901
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:43,760
I studied nutrition.

902
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,679
I'd like to help you

903
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:45,919
improve your health.

904
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,199
No need.

905
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,040
I was just feeling unwell

906
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,600
a few days ago,

907
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,399
but I'm fine now.

908
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
I was planning

909
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,000
to go back to work tomorrow.

910
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,600
Tomorrow?

911
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,120
Aren't you on a vacation?

912
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:01,239
I'm fine to go back to work.

913
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,719
Can I have a cup of coffee?

914
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,320
No.

915
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,600
You can't drink coffee.

916
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,120
Why drink coffee?

917
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,439
I made this soybean milk myself.

918
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,439
I boiled it. It's so good,

919
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,560
unlike the watered-down ones

920
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,639
you get outside.

921
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:21,280
Give it a try.

922
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,320
Okay.

923
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,520
Soybean milk

924
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:23,959
is healthy.

925
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:24,800
Yes.

926
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,399
I'll drink it.

927
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,280
Is it good?

928
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,080
Yes.

929
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:33,719
Have more.

930
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:52,280
Well...

931
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,040
Meng'an,

932
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,919
are you pregnant?

933
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,800
My bad, I didn't notice it.

934
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,560
Why didn't you tell me?

935
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,760
Well,

936
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,199
we didn't mention it

937
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,000
because

938
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,360
it wasn't stable.

939
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,199
Yes.

940
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:15,320
Does Jing know?

941
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,040
She doesn't know.

942
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,959
We haven't even told An's parents.

943
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,399
Got it.

944
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,040
I won't tell her.

945
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,919
Don't.

946
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,919
We don't want false hope.

947
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:24,800
Okay.

948
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,840
You can’t eat greasy food now.

949
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:27,719
I'll make you an egg.

950
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:31,120
Oh no.

951
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,040
The whole world will be informed.

952
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,399
Get ready.

953
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,520
Alright.

954
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,199
♪Flowers burst into bloom in the spring♪

955
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,600
♪Warm sun shines overhead♪

956
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:48,600
Honey.

957
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,520
Honey.

958
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,320
What?

959
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,439
I'm going out.

960
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,239
You're in a good mood.

961
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,520
Where are you going?

962
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:56,520
Honey, I'm meeting someone.

963
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,800
Meeting who?

964
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,280
Dressed so formally.

965
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,879
An important client.

966
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,120
Important?

967
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,199
Who's important?

968
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,719
You're important, honey.

969
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,560
To me, you're the most

970
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,919
important person.

971
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,040
My heart is all yours,

972
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,199
no one else.

973
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,759
I'll be back soon.

974
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,239
Honey.

975
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,639
Mr. Jia,

976
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,199
are these the two gifts?

977
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,679
Alright, good.

978
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,400
Hurry up and go.

979
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,199
Lanxiang,

980
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,120
come here.

981
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:41,839
Okay.

982
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:48,719
Come.

983
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,199
Take a sit.

984
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,239
What's up?

985
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:53,239
Listen,

986
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,040
this is a tablet,

987
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,319
and this is a phone.

988
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:56,759
You can

989
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,719
send them to Ming and Pingping.

990
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,639
The kids are grown up now,

991
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:00,600
they can definitely use them.

992
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,159
I... can't,

993
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:02,120
these are too valuable.

994
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,440
I can't accept them.

995
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,400
It's okay.

996
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,199
They're not new,

997
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,719
just things we've used before.

998
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:07,239
You

999
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,080
just send them to the kids.

1000
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,199
Great.

1001
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,520
The kids need

1002
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,600
them for school.

1003
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,040
I could never bring myself to buy them.

1004
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,319
Thank you so much.

1005
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:18,520
Now you don't have to buy.

1006
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:19,600
Also,

1007
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,719
here's 2,000 yuan.

1008
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,400
Take it.

1009
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,120
I really can't take this, Meng'an.

1010
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,799
You've already

1011
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:25,600
provided me food and a room.

1012
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,279
It's good enough for you

1013
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:27,279
not to ask me for money.

1014
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:28,520
I can't take it.

1015
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,199
If you don't want the money,

1016
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,639
use it to buy groceries.

1017
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,040
We'll eat

1018
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,839
whatever you buy.

1019
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:36,199
You used to do that, right?

1020
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:36,920
Fine.

1021
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,199
I can do that.

1022
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,199
I'll take it then.

1023
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
I don't know how long

1024
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,199
you'll be here.

1025
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,319
Home service companies are

1026
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:46,639
short-staffed now.

1027
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:47,719
You'll probably

1028
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,839
have to leave soon.

1029
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,799
Meng'an,

1030
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,199
is Mengxin truly

1031
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,600
not recruiting?

1032
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:55,799
No,

1033
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:56,799
she's already arranged everything.

1034
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,719
You know

1035
00:35:58,759 --> 00:35:59,319
how hard it is

1036
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:00,759
to take care of Xin.

1037
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,120
I actually

1038
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,880
want to work

1039
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,199
for my own family.

1040
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,639
Money isn't everything.

1041
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,080
Really.

1042
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,679
Just offering me food is fine.

1043
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:10,719
How can that be?

1044
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,480
Everyone works

1045
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,199
for money.

1046
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,319
Don't worry.

1047
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:15,279
Tomorrow

1048
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:16,960
I'll go with you to the company

1049
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,040
and register.

1050
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,199
If there's a suitable family,

1051
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,239
I'll go with you

1052
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,000
to check it out.

1053
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:23,400
We'll find a good one.

1054
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,040
You...

1055
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,120
You don't want to go?

1056
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,120
Or...

1057
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,040
Meng'an, to be honest,

1058
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,679
this time

1059
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,839
I ran away from home.

1060
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,679
Why?

1061
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
My husband

1062
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,520
hits me and the kids

1063
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,400
whenever he's drunk,

1064
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:52,359
The kids have

1065
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:53,719
gone to school now,

1066
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,839
and I couldn't

1067
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,400
stay at home anymore.

1068
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,719
I thought I'd find a job.

1069
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,279
But wherever I went,

1070
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,719
he followed.

1071
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Before I finished work,

1072
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,400
he'd throw a fit for money.

1073
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,400
People are scared of him.

1074
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,040
So

1075
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:10,000
now no home service company

1076
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:12,279
wants to hire me.

1077
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Then you stop looking for jobs,

1078
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,839
just stay here.

1079
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,239
We're relatives,

1080
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,239
he probably won't dare to come here.

1081
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,120
If he does,

1082
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:21,960
I'll call the police.

1083
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:22,759
Okay?

1084
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,359
Meng'an,

1085
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:27,359
thank you.

1086
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,040
Thanks.

1087
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:28,960
You're welcome.

1088
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:29,799
We're family,

1089
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,839
there's no need to say that.

1090
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:42,839
I bought a soft-shelled turtle.

1091
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,040
I brought a lot of cubilose.

1092
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,839
And then?

1093
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,799
And then...

1094
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,480
Then we came here.

1095
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,839
Alright then,

1096
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,159
I'm pregnant

1097
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,400
with the second child.

1098
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,600
We knew it!

1099
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,639
Come on.

1100
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,159
Give me five.

1101
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:06,639
Give me five.

1102
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,679
Why are you so happy about it?

1103
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,239
Who spread the news?

1104
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,480
Look at you.

1105
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,719
What are you guys,

1106
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,679
spies?

1107
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,480
We have our sources.

1108
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,359
We knew about it long ago.

1109
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,440
We wanted to call you,

1110
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,880
but your mom didn't dare.

1111
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,520
I said we'd wait for

1112
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,400
a few more days.

1113
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,319
Actually, your mom and I knew

1114
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:31,839
why you didn't

1115
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,040
tell us.

1116
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,000
You didn't want us to worry.

1117
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,600
What's there to worry about

1118
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,960
with the good news?

1119
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,040
Exactly.

1120
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,639
Let me tell you,

1121
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,560
your mom and I

1122
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,080
are overjoyed

1123
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,199
these days.

1124
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,120
You know?

1125
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,759
For example,

1126
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,639
you know,

1127
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,120
before, your mom couldn't sleep

1128
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,719
with even the slightest bit of light,

1129
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:51,560
but now

1130
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,279
she needs

1131
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,639
the curtains open.

1132
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:54,839
Why?

1133
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:55,719
Because she spends her nights

1134
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,639
gazing at the stars.

1135
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,880
She's restless in bed,

1136
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,000
unable to sleep,

1137
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,600
then she paces

1138
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,880
back and forth,

1139
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,000
and moves around.

1140
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,000
Just look at my dark circles.

1141
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,759
Yeah.

1142
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,040
Severe.

1143
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,960
Yeah.

1144
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,639
My bad.

1145
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,400
No.

1146
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,199
We're so happy,

1147
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:14,960
full of joy.

1148
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:16,839
Alright,

1149
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,359
enough with the happiness.

1150
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,199
Let's get to the point.

1151
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,159
- Nothing. - The thing is...

1152
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,880
What's up?

1153
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:23,839
Got anything?

1154
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:26,880
Step aside.

1155
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:34,839
Okay.

1156
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:37,480
I'll check it out.

1157
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,600
Well,

1158
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,679
Lanxiang probably can't cook the turtle.

1159
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,520
I need to check.

1160
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:43,639
Asking my dad to step aside,

1161
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,400
suggests this matter is quite serious.

1162
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,440
It's not a big deal.

1163
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,239
You're having a second child.

1164
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,279
Have you read

1165
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:52,639
the national policy on this?

1166
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,560
Have you learned it?

1167
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:54,679
What policy?

1168
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,239
I inquired at the police station,

1169
00:39:58,319 --> 00:39:58,759
and it turns out these days

1170
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:00,080
a child can take

1171
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,759
either

1172
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:02,400
the father's or mother's surname.

1173
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,920
This option is also available for the first child.

1174
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,359
It hasn't changed for years.

1175
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,600
Well,

1176
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,480
it's not like that.

1177
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,600
Now you can choose

1178
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,839
the surname of the paternal

1179
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:12,600
or maternal grandparents.

1180
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,719
Wu Lining,

1181
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,080
do you want the child

1182
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,679
to take your surname?

1183
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,480
Yes.

1184
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,040
Isn't that too much?

1185
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,639
No.

1186
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,759
Not me.

1187
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:26,120
It's

1188
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,719
having your dad's surname, Xu,

1189
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,319
Xu?

1190
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:30,440
That's also way too much.

1191
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,920
Too much?

1192
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,279
Isn't it too much?

1193
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,480
Wu's daughter,

1194
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:36,839
she...

1195
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:37,839
What does Wu's family

1196
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,880
have to do with us?

1197
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,159
An, please...

1198
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,520
Stop it,

1199
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,839
I'm not my dad.

1200
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,239
Seriously.

1201
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,520
Well,

1202
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,279
I just wish for the Xu's

1203
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:56,199
household registration

1204
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,359
to carry on.

1205
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:58,960
Xin and I

1206
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,199
are not on the registration booklet?

1207
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,880
But the registration would end after you.

1208
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,920
Whose fault is that?

1209
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,679
It's not my fault.

1210
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,920
It's your dad.

1211
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,520
Fine,

1212
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,839
then ask my dad to talk to me.

1213
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,719
Dad,

1214
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,440
come on in, let's talk.

1215
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:14,239
No, no.

1216
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:14,839
This...

1217
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,319
None of your business.

1218
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:17,520
It's fine.

1219
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,480
Step aside.

1220
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,279
Quite confident.

1221
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,199
Taking it all on?

1222
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,520
No...

1223
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,520
I know what you're thinking.

1224
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,040
You feel like

1225
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,440
you've let my dad down

1226
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,839
by not giving him a son, right?

1227
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,719
How does that

1228
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,560
concern us?

1229
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,319
I'll be serious with you now.

1230
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,359
This matter

1231
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:45,400
ends here.

1232
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,839
Don't mention it to anyone,

1233
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,920
especially Li Lin and Yunjie.

1234
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,880
If you bring it up again,

1235
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,239
I'll really get angry. Got it?

1236
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,520
Can't we discuss it?

1237
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
No way.

1238
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,600
Sit properly.

1239
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,239
What's wrong with you?

1240
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,639
You mustn't give my dad a hard time later.

1241
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,000
Did you see

1242
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,520
her attitude just now?

1243
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,440
She was so harsh,

1244
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,120
leaving no room for negotiation.

1245
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,759
What's wrong with the surname Xu?

1246
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:29,040
She bears the surname Xu as well.

1247
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,159
Isn't that a good thing?

1248
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,000
She should be supporting us.

1249
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,520
Why is she...

1250
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,839
She's been like this,

1251
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,000
always against me.

1252
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,480
Did I raise a daughter

1253
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,920
or a mother?

1254
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,719
Gosh.

1255
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:41,199
Am I right?

1256
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,880
You're right.

1257
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:46,719
She's your child. Why get angry?

1258
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,839
It's not about anger.

1259
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,239
This is for

1260
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,920
the Xu family's good.

1261
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,839
Isn't it?

1262
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:54,520
Why is she so stubborn?

1263
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,080
You see...

1264
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,120
You didn't see

1265
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,279
her attitude.

1266
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:58,839
Looks like...

1267
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,239
What did she say?

1268
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:02,040
She said,

1269
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:03,839
"No way. Don't even think about it."

1270
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,480
"It's impossible."

1271
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,560
That firm attitude.

1272
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,839
Oh my.

1273
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,040
I just don't understand.

1274
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,239
Listen,

1275
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,120
Lili,

1276
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,279
actually, it's my fault.

1277
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,440
I always say to you

1278
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,839
how excellent

1279
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:22,920
my brother's sons are.

1280
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,040
I wasn't saying it

1281
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,279
for you to hear.

1282
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,639
Isn't it nice

1283
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,920
to have two children,

1284
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,319
one surnamed Xu

1285
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,120
and the other Li?

1286
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,799
It's perfect.

1287
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:35,080
Why is she overreacting like that?

1288
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,639
Yeah, you are right.
