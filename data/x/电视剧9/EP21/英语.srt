Just in Time EP21

3
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,560
How

4
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,400
to make friends with the ex-wife?

5
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,710
Let me answer your question.

6
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,190
In general,

7
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,710
it's scarcely possible for a man

8
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,430
to maintain friendship

9
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,680
with your ex-wife.

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,040
But if you

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
still hope

12
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,830
to be friends after the divorce,

13
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,400
you may

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
still get a chance.

15
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,630
That's good.

16
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,310
So, first of all,

17
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,030
it had to be a peaceful separation

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,120
for your divorce.

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
You didn't kick up a row.

20
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,830
Absolutely not.

21
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,750
So if both sides

22
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,430
keep on good terms with each other,

23
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,640
it means they're broad-minded

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,710
and generous.

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,150
Wanzhen is good in this respect.

26
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,480
Above all,

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
if the ex-wife

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,990
or the ex-husband

29
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,200
doesn't look for

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
a new partner,

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,710
your marital relations

32
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,240
may be maintained.

33
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,960
I'll never find another woman.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,030
Wanzhen probably won't do it either.

35
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,080
How to remarry the ex-wife?

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,430
Actually eighty-five percent

37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:54,990
of divorce

38
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,310
can be restored.

39
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,990
First of all,

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,550
you listen to what she says.

41
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,550
Show her your sincerity.

42
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,710
I said it all.

43
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,590
No use, man.

44
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,270
Use the resources of marriage.

45
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,990
For example,

46
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,150
create some

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,030
warm and beautiful moments

48
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,710
between parents and children.

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,080
Use resources.

50
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,920
Since

51
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,750
you two

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,030
are divorced,

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,800
it means

54
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,680
some characters of you

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,360
made her

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,920
weary.

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,080
If you wish to get remarried with her,

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,550
you've to figure out

59
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,590
what these flaws are.

60
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,310
Then

61
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,270
you strive to meet what your ex-wife

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
really needs.

63
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,400
Only if you do that,

64
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,400
can your marriage be restored.

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,990
What she really needs.

66
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,240
Resources.

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,680
Hello.

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,310
Hello.

69
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,360
Zhou Yao.

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,750
It's me, Chan Wanzhen.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,750
Oh, Wendy.

72
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,390
What's up?

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,750
Wanna catch up?

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,510
I'm calling you

75
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,280
as I think

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
you're the best player

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,190
in financial field.

78
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,800
So,

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,950
I have a question for you.

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,390
Okay, what is it?

81
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,280
I've been investigating

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,070
the financial status of a company.

83
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,190
So through various channels

84
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,480
some financial data has been collected.

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
What's your discovery?

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,840
This group runs their main business

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,840
in the secondary industry,

88
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
It's a pillar type.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Moreover,

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,550
it's a big company.

91
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,390
To the outsiders,

92
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,480
they're very successful.

93
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
But I found

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,630
their debt ratio

95
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,160
was very high.

96
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,190
It's already higher

97
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
than the warning level of the bank.

98
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,390
if I'm

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,120
right,

100
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
they're gonna go bankrupt soon.

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,550
A huge business empire

102
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,190
is about to crash.

103
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,190
I know

104
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,240
which company it is.

105
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,750
I've been keeping eyes on it, too.

106
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,800
If any of your friends

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,680
owns its stocks

108
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,550
and financial products,

109
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,550
please advise them to sell off at once.

110
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,600
Your judgment is very accurate.

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,870
The company is gonna collapse.

112
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm an

113
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,360
unlicensed practitioner,

114
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,310
yet you're so confident in me.

115
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,630
Thank you, Zhou Yao.

116
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,510
Wendy.

117
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,240
You know

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,510
the most powerful capability of you

119
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,720
is the intuition.

120
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,800
You intuition judgment is awesome.

121
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,750
Chen Wanzhen,

122
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,720
I sincerely invite you

123
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,680
to join

124
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,160
Yaohui Investments.

125
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,920
Got it.

126
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,310
Come on, give it to me.

127
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,600
Don't

128
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,280
use lipsticks any more.

129
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,190
It makes me look good.

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,430
Rest assured.

131
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,120
Just use the formula I gave you on time,

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
I promise you will look good.

133
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,240
When you weren't at home yesterday,

134
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,360
I cleaned up the room.

135
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
I checked

136
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,280
all these makeups,

137
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,950
including this lipstick.

138
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,920
Most of them are in inferior quality.

139
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
They contain lead and mercury.

140
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,870
Mercury, you know?

141
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,310
It's

142
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
poisonous.

143
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,510
Then what?

144
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,240
You can't use it.

145
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Only this one

146
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,990
can be used

147
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,190
as I checked.

148
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,160
I picked it out for you

149
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,840
and put it here.

150
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,310
This is made from plants.

151
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,720
You can use it.

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm putting them away, okay?

153
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,360
Are you gonna throw them away?

154
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,550
No.

155
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,310
I will keep them for you.

156
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,950
After you deliver the baby,

157
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,160
I gonna give them back to you, okay?

158
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,360
Okay.

159
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
Come on.

160
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,430
You sit over here.

161
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,800
Come on.

162
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,600
Let me check.

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
Unhealthy.

164
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,750
It'll be put away.

165
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,840
Below standard.

166
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,190
Pack them in.

167
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
What are you doing, Jing?

168
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,280
And this one.

169
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,990
The induction cooker

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,600
and pot

171
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,750
can't be used.

172
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,750
They're radiative.

173
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,120
Not this one.

174
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,920
We need it to steam buns

175
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,840
and rice.

176
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,510
No!

177
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,840
We can use gas.

178
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,320
Enough.

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
Leave me alone. I can handle it.

180
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,960
Hang on.

181
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,840
Hang on.

182
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,600
Hang on.

183
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,480
Just a moment.

184
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,870
Oh...

185
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,560
What the hell is going on here?

186
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Give this to Meng'an.

187
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,720
What's this?

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,840
Listen.

189
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I bought her

190
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,600
radiation protective clothes for pregnant women.

191
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,840
A lot of computers

192
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,270
are in her offices.

193
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,320
She can put it on

194
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,240
for radiation protection.

195
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,480
What's the use?

196
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,200
She won't wear it.

197
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,960
The radiation

198
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,630

199
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,870
for daily use

200
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,960
is almost unharmful.

201
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Don't listen to the false ad.

202
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,360
It's useless.

203
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,870
But they sell it.

204
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
We'd rather

205
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,360
believe the ad.

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,990
Besides,

207
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,240
Those radiation

208
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,320
unharmful to us

209
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,440
is still unsafe to pregnant women.

210
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,270
You know?

211
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,510
No more talking.

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,670
Just give it to her.

213
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,750
She won't wear it.

214
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,720
How can you be

215
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,440
so sure?

216
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm her husband.

217
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Of course, I know.

218
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
You let her make the decision.

219
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,750
Enough.

220
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,990
Don't keep your wife waiting.

221
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,510
Hurry, hurry.

222
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,670
Just take it and give it to her

223
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,440
Go, go.

224
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,600
Don't keep her waiting.

225
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,150
That's it.

226
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,480
It's...

227
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
It's too hard to convince him.

228
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
Oh...

229
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,390
He knows nothing about scientific knowledge.

230
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,120
Geez.

231
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,510
Okay.

232
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,150
I'll wear it!

233
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,390
No!

234
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,080
If you get the knowledge, you won't wear it.

235
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,150
It's not about knowledge,

236
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,910
but a worldly wisdom.

237
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,790
What do you mean?

238
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,630
See?

239
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,870
You've got to have the wisdom.

240
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
You know she is stubborn,

241
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
right?

242
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,150
Even if I'm not wearing it today,

243
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,270
she's gonna put it on for me

244
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,080
tomorrow.

245
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,320
I might as well just tell her

246
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,990
I wore it.

247
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,600
Then I can put it in the car.

248
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,390
She won't know

249
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,670
whether I wore it or not.

250
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,720
Right?

251
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,200
She came out.

252
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,720
Hurry.

253
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,600
Let's go.

254
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,480
No!

255
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,120
Put it on.

256
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:28,960
Put it on.

257
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,600
Put it on?

258
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,670
I put it on and show her,

259
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,150
then she'll let it go, you know?

260
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,960
Jing.

261
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,120
You've put it on?

262
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,960
How do you like it?

263
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
I love it.

264
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,390
I was trying

265
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,320
to buy one on line

266
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,360
a few days ago.

267
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,200
Great.

268
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,560
Li Lin,

269
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,080
I told you.

270
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,240
Let her make the decision.

271
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,670
We'll be late.

272
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,150
Jing, we gotta go.

273
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,320
Wait.

274
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,840
Get off.

275
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,750
My dear sister,

276
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,870
we're gonna be late.

277
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,390
Get off!

278
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Why?

279
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,080
Get off.

280
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,910
Come.

281
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,200
Tell me.

282
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,240
What's wrong now?

283
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,870
She's pregnant,

284
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,960
isn't it?

285
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,670
She needs to be highly concentrated for driving.

286
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
She's to brake frequently.

287
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,150
It's dangerous and may cause miscarriage.

288
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,150
I'll drive.

289
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,870
Right?

290
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,150
Bingo.

291
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,990
Sorry for my inconsideration.

292
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,150
You were indeed inconsiderate.

293
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:28,910
Come.

294
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,150
You just sit in the car.

295
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,840
Don't drive.

296
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,030
Okay?

297
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,510
Don't drive during your pregnancy.

298
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,120
Come.

299
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,960
Watch out.

300
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,480
Okay.

301
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,200
Here, fasten the seat belt.

302
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,840
Close the car door.

303
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Drive carefully.

304
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,240
Just close it!

305
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,030
Be careful.

306
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,150
Move aside. I'm turning off.

307
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,390
Yeah.

308
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,360
You're almost like He now.

309
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,120
Where did you wash your face?

310
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,150
At home.

311
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,790
My husband's sister

312
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,270
took all

313
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,320
my makeups away. I've got no choice.

314
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,840
The spare ones come in handy.

315
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,360
What's this?

316
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,670
An apron?

317
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,080
Why do you take this?

318
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,790
Radiation protective clothes for pregnant women.

319
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,080
You haven't seen it, I guess.

320
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,990
Wow, look.

321
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,670
You just declared your pregnancy yesterday.

322
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,720
Now you're wearing it.

323
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,720
You're showing everyone that

324
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,840
you're pregnant.

325
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,790
My husband's sister bought it for me.

326
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,630
Does it work?

327
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,790
Yeah.

328
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,720
If I need to take the subway

329
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,720
when my license plate number

330
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
is in the traffic restriction,

331
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,560
I'll wear it.

332
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,270
Someone will surely offer a seat to me.

333
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,630
Good idea.

334
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,630
I'll buy one later on.

335
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,270
Right?

336
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,630
I've found

337
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,600
something is inevitable in life.

338
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,630
When I was getting married,

339
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,960
I was quite happy for a period

340
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,510
as I wouldn't have a mother-in-law.

341
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,440
Unexpectedly,

342
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
my husband's sister

343
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,790
comes.

344
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,320
She is even harder to get along than a mother-in-law.

345
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:51,790
Am I right?

346
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,510
Something in life

347
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,630
is inevitable, right?

348
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,270
Exactly.

349
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Make vigorous efforts

350
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,670
for big achievements.

351
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,560
Let's go!

352
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,150
I heard

353
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,750
Ms. Xu wanted to promote me.

354
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,560
Is it true?

355
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,240
Yes, I heard of it.

356
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,320
Meichuan,

357
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,790
you've to know how to do well.

358
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,510
Okay.

359
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,480
Go ahead.

360
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,720
What do you want for lunch?

361
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,960
Ms. Xu!

362
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
Let me help you.

363
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,840
Come on.

364
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,790
No, well.

365
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,480
Slow down.

366
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,360
Take care of the baby.

367
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,240
Make way.

368
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,030
Make way, everyone.

369
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:45,960
Knock it off.

370
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,030
Nobody is here.

371
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,390
It's a rehearsal.

372
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,200
Go, go.

373
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,560
No.

374
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,670
In advanced maternal age,

375
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,870
you've to be careful.

376
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,270
Meichuan,

377
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,320
hold Ms. Xu.

378
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
You're making a fuss.

379
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,750
Ms. Xu,

380
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,910
I have some projects

381
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,480
to report

382
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,630
to you.

383
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,750
Let's go to my office.

384
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,240
Okay.

385
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,630
Ms. Xu.

386
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,960
Just go ahead with your work, okay?

387
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,030
Sit down.

388
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,510
These are all baby's stuff

389
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,030
I bought.

390
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
Oh, that's too kind of you.

391
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,510
After all, it's good news.

392
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,320
Mr. Zhang told me

393
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,750
to learn from you

394
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,480
and do a good job.

395
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,670
So that the content department

396
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,750
can transit and operate well

397
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,510
during your pregnancy and maternity leave.

398
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,440
The transition period has to be copped with.

399
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,870
But first of all, I wish you

400
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,600
to get familiar with the business soon.

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,480
Then you can take that responsibility.

402
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,120
I hope you'll take over my job.

403
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,200
Thank you Ms. Xu. I'll work hard.

404
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,870
Have a seat.

405
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,440
Sugar-free?

406
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,870
On discount.

407
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Four pieces are enough.

408
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,080
She's to eat them every day.

409
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,840
They're on discount.

410
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,320
You don't have to follow me.

411
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,720
I can buy things myself.

412
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,990
I'll be with you.

413
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,510
What's up?

414
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,670
Lost your job?

415
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,990
No, I didn't.

416
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,320
I work at a university now.

417
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,390
I've time before going to work.

418
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,360
I'll be here with you.

419
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,840
I know

420
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,080
you're just worried about me buying things

421
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,480
recklessly.

422
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,910
Right.

423
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,870
I don't want you to spend money recklessly.

424
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,630
You're right.

425
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,670
Don't worry.

426
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,910
I'm more experienced in shopping than you.

427
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
I know what to buy.

428
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,270
Take some of these.

429
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,630
Get the hawthorn, not others.

430
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,390
Hawthorn is good.

431
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,790
Meng'an has a bad appetite lately.

432
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,720
Get her hawthorns to whet her appetite.

433
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
It contains too much sugar.

434
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,030
She can't eat this.

435
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,150
What can she eat?

436
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,360
Spare ribs.

437
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,270
I'll get some

438
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,270
to stew tonight.

439
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,080
Okay. Yunjie also likes to eat.

440
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,080
Don't care too much

441
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,750
about Yunjie.

442
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,910
Just

443
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,630
take good care of Meng'an.

444
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,200
That's not reasonable.

445
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,670
Yunge is fifteen years old.

446
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,840
It's her growth period.

447
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,360
Better for her to eat some nutritious food.

448
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,990
Alright.

449
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,360
Jing,

450
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,960
you can stay here.

451
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,600
But

452
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,390
make no trouble for me.

453
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,910
What trouble have I gotten you into?

454
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,790
You came here,

455
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,360
then Mengxin's wound

456
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,600
tore apart.

457
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,560
What's going on?

458
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,710
Not my fault.

459
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,320
She has a bad temper.

460
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,870
Really?

461
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,150
Yeah.

462
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,320
How long are you gonna stay here?

463
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,430
You've seen her

464
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,470
and felt relieved.

465
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,910
Then

466
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:31,910
you can go back.

467
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,840
These white fungi are good.

468
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
I can make white fungi soup with pears.

469
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,800
You think I have nothing to do?

470
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,520
Meng'an is

471
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,040
pregnant,

472
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,430
I just wanna help.

473
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,360
It's also

474
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,470
for the descendant of the Li family.

475
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,040
I know you mean well.

476
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,470
500 grams, please.

477
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,190
But

478
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,320
as the saying goes,

479
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,560
harmony at home brings prosperity.

480
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,280
The key word is harmony.

481
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,230
It means we've to know

482
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,840
our place in life

483
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,430
and say proper words.

484
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,670
You're

485
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,910
my sister.

486
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Not a mother-in-law.

487
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,840
Did I say I was the mother-in-law?

488
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,840
I get along with Meng'an.

489
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,560
Don't I?

490
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,760
You've been talking nonsense.

491
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,230
How annoying!

492
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,190
What are you doing?

493
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,040
Put it inside.

494
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,560
Lower your voice.

495
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,870
The smell of cinnamon is too strong.

496
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,360
Meng'an is pregnant.

497
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,520
She can't stand this.

498
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,430
I need it for cooking.

499
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,120
Put it here.

500
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,320
She doesn't want this.

501
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,430
I know her well.

502
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,760
Take it back.

503
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,520
No.

504
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,080
Take it back.

505
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,670
No.

506
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,150
I decide what I'll buy.

507
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,320
You hear me?

508
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,560
It's on me.

509
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,560
Too bad.

510
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,120
Too bad.

511
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,910
Ms. Xu,

512
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,710
I got you cubilose drink.

513
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,670
Remember to drink it later.

514
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,910
Thank you.

515
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,630
You're welcome.

516
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,470
Ms. Xu,

517
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,670
will we still hold the meeting this afternoon?

518
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,120
Yeah. Why not?

519
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,870
We are worried that you'll be too tired.

520
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,080
Maybe we can do it tomorrow.

521
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,190
No, go ahead as scheduled.

522
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,080
Tell them

523
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,560
I'm fine with it.

524
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,470
Okay.

525
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,800
Ms. Xu, you are here.

526
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,760
I've been looking for you.

527
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,120
Oh my.

528
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,320
They are all bought

529
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,390
by other colleagues?

530
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,320
Yeah.

531
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,390
Well,

532
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,710
I also bought you a lot.

533
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,910
Can you eat them up?

534
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,190
Definitely not.

535
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,320
Do you want to eat some for me?

536
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,190
No.

537
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,000
But these things

538
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,560
are high in oil and sugar.

539
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,320
You'd better not eat too much.

540
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,600
You're experienced in this.

541
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,910
My wife,

542
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,520
about the same age of you,

543
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,870
has just conceived a second child.

544
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,360
When did she get pregnant?

545
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,280
How many months of it?

546
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,950
Just three months.

547
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,950
It's indeed almost the same time.

548
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,710
But I think

549
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,870
you and your husband

550
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,120
are brave.

551
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,280
To be honest,

552
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,430
it took me and my wife

553
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,870
a careful consideration

554
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,320
before we made our mind to have a second child.

555
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,840
Are you kidding?

556
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,320
You're a vice president.

557
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,430
To raise one more child

558
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,800
wouldn't be a financial burden to you.

559
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,950
It's not what you think.

560
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,430
Let me tell you.

561
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,840
A child already

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,320
makes us stressed out.

563
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,870
If a second one comes,

564
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,760
I really need to get another job

565
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,670
for raising the child.

566
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,950
You didn't really drink

567
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,630
on the business luncheon, did you?

568
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes, I did.

569
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,870
Are you serious?

570
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,840
You're pregnant,

571
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,080
yet you still drank it?

572
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,950
Well, it's for business, right?

573
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,320
It's okay. If I drink too much,

574
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,360
I can just go home to throw it up.

575
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,760
You work so hard.

576
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,560
It's been hard on you.

577
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,320
But take care of your health.

578
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,390
Eat in moderation.

579
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:05,950
I'm leaving.

580
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,710
Work so hard.

581
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,150
So nice.

582
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,630
Someone is awaiting me.

583
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,040
Wonderful.

584
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
Wonderful.

585
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,520
A long time since last time.

586
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,560
I wanna talk with you about something important.

587
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,390
Your business

588
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,390
is definitely important to me.

589
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,800
Some of your friends

590
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
registered

591
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,520
in my company.

592
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,910
But I can't reach them.

593
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,280
Can you put me in touch with them?

594
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
I need to talk to them.

595
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,670
Were they not answering your calls?

596
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,190
Which one, you mean?

597
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,670
Why didn't he answer?

598
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,560
He could be your friend

599
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,430
on your side.

600
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,470
No, no.

601
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,150
I've not said a single bad word

602
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,390
about you before anyone.

603
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,320
I know.

604
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,120
Maybe I'm salesperson now.

605
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,630
It's reasonable for them to block me.

606
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,600
So, you see.

607
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,560
Why do you have to

608
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,520
do sales?

609
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,870
Don't worry. It won't last long.

610
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,080
I won't bother you anymore.

611
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,760
You've quit?

612
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,520
Then, what...

613
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,120
What are your planning to do?

614
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,760
Do I have to report it to you?

615
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,390
I'm sending you the name list.

616
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,910
Oh, Mr. Wu wasn't answering your calls, too.

617
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,910
Mr. Wu, this is Yu Hai.

618
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,600
My...

619
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,710
My kid's mom

620
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,150
is a salesperson.

621
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,360
So, she needs to talk to you.

622
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,910
Don't hang up.

623
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,600
She's right next to me.

624
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,870
She'll talk to you.

625
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,560
Just listen to what she says.

626
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,040
Hello, Mr. Wu.

627
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,430
Hello.

628
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,670
This is Chen Wanzhen.

629
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,870
Did our salesperson

630
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,800
call you?

631
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,360
Yeah. Don't buy a financial product.

632
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,630
You'd better think about it carefully.

633
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,800
It's a risk.

634
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,870
Is it over?

635
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,040
Thank you.

636
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,230
I'm leaving.

637
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,120
No, no.

638
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,000
You've already here.

639
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,950
How about

640
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,080
going to the Chinese restaurant over there

641
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,710
to have a meal?

642
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,840
No, I already had.

643
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:13,870
So,

644
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,320
go to my room for a while.

645
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,520
What do you want?

646
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,230
No, no.

647
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,230
You're overthinking.

648
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,120
I brought presents for our child.

649
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,870
It's in the suitcase.

650
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,800
It's not good

651
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,950
to open it in the lobby.

652
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,760
Smelly shoes

653
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,630
and socks are in it.

654
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,710
The toy

655
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,840
is packed with these things?

656
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,360
I don't want it.

657
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
No, no.

658
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,950
No.

659
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,230
It's wrapped

660
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,280
by the ziploc bag.

661
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,080
They're

662
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:33,840
separated.

663
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,320
Let's go.

664
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,470
Just a moment.

665
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,390
I'll bring it out for you.

666
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,840
You can take it and leave.

667
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,080
You still don't live at home.

668
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,560
It's no fun going home.

669
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,430
None of you are there.

670
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,950
So it's deserted.

671
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,190
Such a big house.

672
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,320
It's a pity.

673
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
You might as well rent it out.

674
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,710
You can earn some money.

675
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,470
Why would I rent it?

676
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,840
I won't let someone else sleep in my bed

677
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,230
and use

678
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,760
our kitchen and utensils,

679
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,760
and our toilet.

680
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,950
That's our home.

681
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,760
Our former home.

682
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,190
Former home.

683
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,040
Our former home.

684
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,360
Actually,

685
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,840
you know,

686
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,280
only a place with families

687
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,430
can be called home.

688
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,600
Alright, I've got the present.

689
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,360
I'm leaving.

690
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,470
Wait.

691
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,360
Wait a minute.

692
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,520
I have a meeting

693
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,150
with an investor this afternoon.

694
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,360
I wanna

695
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,630
wear this suit,

696
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,950
and

697
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,430
the shirt.

698
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,320
You...

699
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,950
pick a tie for me, okay?

700
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,470
Please.

701
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,390
The blue one.

702
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,670
This one?

703
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,950
Perfect.

704
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,470
Look.

705
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,040
If I have a meeting with someone

706
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,150
and don't know which clothes to wear,

707
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,800
I'll take pictures for you

708
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,910
to help me choose from?

709
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,520
No need, Yu Hai.

710
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,080
If you have nothing to say,

711
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,230
you don't have to find a topic to talk.

712
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,470
It's so hard

713
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,120
for you

714
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,150
to find a topic

715
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,910
to talk with me.

716
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
Isn't it

717
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,560
because we have nothing in common?

718
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,560
It proves

719
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,870
it's a wise decision for us to get divorced.

720
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,150
No.

721
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:41,800
Why do you

722
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,040
have to say like that?

723
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,390
I used to help you match your clothes

724
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,910
as I was your wife.

725
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,470
It was what a wife would do.

726
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,520
But now I think

727
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,000
what matters is not what you wear.

728
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,760
What the investors

729
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,600
hope to see is your strength.

730
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,430
Even if you wear a hoodie

731
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,150
and sweatpants,

732
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,840
they'll still choose to be your partner

733
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,470
as long as Blue Ocean is worth investing in.

734
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,800
What do you say?

735
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,320
You're right.

736
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,560
So,

737
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
don't get yourself distracted.

738
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,950
Just focus on your career.

739
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,390
That's what the investor

740
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,320
wish to see,

741
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,840
a diligent boss of a startup.

742
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,870
Wish you success!

743
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,080
So

744
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,470
being pregnant with a second child

745
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
is a good thing.

746
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,840
It can get me

747
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,560
more attention

748
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
in the company.

749
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,670
And I have a sense

750
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,040
of presence.

751
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,040
Are you done?

752
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,950
Yes.

753
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,390
It's overtime.

754
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,840
It only takes two or three minutes

755
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,080
for you to be self-consistent.

756
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,080
But It took you five minutes and 36 seconds today.

757
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,600
The point is it doesn't work out so well.

758
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,280
What do you think I can do

759
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,760
to get everyone

760
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,870
have less attention on me?

761
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,670
It's unlikely to lessen it.

762
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,800
But we can divert their attention to others.

763
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,360
How?

764
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,470
Mass pregnancy,

765
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,120
including all.

766
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,670
Mr. Zhou

767
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,950
is gonna have a second baby.

768
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,000
Why doesn't everyone

769
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,120
pay more attention to him?

770
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,710
What trick did he use?

771
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,840
Analyze the reason for me.

772
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,230
Due to gender difference.

773
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,840
I'm frustrated to hear this.

774
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,150
No need to be frustrated.

775
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,080
Having a second child

776
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,870
is indeed a happy event in the long run.

777
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,760
But just for this period,

778
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,520
it will indeed

779
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,470
impact a working woman's career.

780
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,470
But I think six months

781
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,150
is just

782
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,190
like a pit in your life.

783
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,230
You can exert your strength to jump it over.

784
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,080
So I'd like to say

785
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,150
it's great to talk to you.

786
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,630
You're far-sighted.

787
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,080
Look,

788
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,910
you're ten years younger than me.

789
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,230
How can you

790
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,560
see these things through?

791
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,470
The onlookers see most clearly.

792
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,230
It's just normal

793
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,470
if you can't see the problems

794
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,320
through like me

795
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
as you're pregnant.

796
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,150
That really comforts me.

797
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,230
So tell me

798
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,390
what I should do next.

799
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,120
The due date is more than six months away.

800
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,840
You can

801
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
arrange all the work during this time.

802
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
Use the power of a team

803
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,320
to get through

804
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,760
this special time.

805
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,760
That's what I'm planning.

806
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,760
However,

807
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,000
you've to deal with Mr. Zhang.

808
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Have you thought about it?

809
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,710
How do you prove to him

810
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,560
that you can still

811
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,040
lead the team

812
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,670
to meet targets during your pregnancy?

813
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,190
You've to

814
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,710
make him feel assured.

815
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,870
I see.

816
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,120
Your files.

817
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,470
Thank you.

818
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,520
I'm at the sales office.

819
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,000
The real estate company

820
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,150
where we bought our apartments.

821
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,600
They've launched wealth management products.

822
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,910
The interest rates are high.

823
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,670
Come and have a look.

824
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,190
Okay.

825
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,710
Hello, sir.

826
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,080
Hello.

827
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,120
Are you here to buy financial products?

828
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,710
Yeah.

829
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,910
I'm a regular customer

830
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,670
of this company.

831
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,760
My two apartments

832
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,120
were bought from them.

833
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,150
Buying an apartment is okay.

834
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,150
But you've to be prudent

835
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,040
about the wealth management product.

836
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Why?

837
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,430
You're...?

838
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm a salesperson of this company.

839
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,670
Feifei's call.

840
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,390
So,

841
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,950
you do sales.

842
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,230
But you talk to me not to buy it.

843
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,760
What do you mean?

844
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,390
If I buy it

845
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,190
and take a share,

846
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,040
then you can't

847
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,390
leave it for your family, right?

848
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,230
Sir, you take me wrong.

849
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,840
I'm trying to help you.

850
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,870
Ms.,

851
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,630
you seem kind to me.

852
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,190
What?

853
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,520
But you even deceive the elderly.

854
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,800
Sir, I'm trying to help you.

855
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,120
No, no. I'm not talking to you.

856
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,950
Stop. Stop talking.

857
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,710
That's what

858
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,470
about the online sales arrangement.

859
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,600
Anything else?

860
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,390
No.

861
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,760
Mr. Zhang, we...

862
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,150
The meeting is over then.

863
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,280
It's over.

864
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,120
Do you have any other instructions?

865
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,560
It's your department's internal meeting.

866
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,430
Why do you ask me to sit in?

867
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,430
After the content division merger,

868
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,870
it's

869
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,430
the first quarterly outlook.

870
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,230
And the team building

871
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,800
is done.

872
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,950
I'm supposed to report it to you.

873
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,080
Not to make me feel assured?

874
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,230
It's not

875
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,430
Rachel's stupid idea

876
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,390
for you?

877
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,080
You found it.

878
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,000
Of course.

879
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,800
I've been leading you both for years.

880
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,520
What are you two up to together

881
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,870
won't be hided from me.

882
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,950
Just like

883
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,000
you can figure out my intention.

884
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,000
No.

885
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,870
It's normal for you to know what we're up to.

886
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,320
But it matters

887
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,630
for a worker to understand

888
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,910
the leader's intention

889
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,040
in the workplace.

890
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,600
Everybody does it.

891
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,040
Right.

892
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,230
To make you rest assured,

893
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,360
I invited you to attend the meeting.

894
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
You know,

895
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,470
I'm pregnant.

896
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,150
But I'm still competent for the job.

897
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
After all, I've got the wisdom and experience needed.

898
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,600
I wish you won't worry about it.

899
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,390
Meng'an,

900
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,000
I'd like to be frank

901
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,430
with you.

902
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,320
I can understand

903
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,120
and feel happy

904
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,630
that you're pregnant

905
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,000
with a

906
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,470
second child.

907
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,760
It's a happy event

908
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,430
for you to give a safe and smooth birth

909
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,080
of the baby.

910
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,320
But

911
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,470
as a boss,

912
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,280
I've to say

913
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,000
your six-month maternity leave

914
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,430
is a long period.

915
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,390
We make content for growth.

916
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,320
A new media company

917
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,630
can't afford it.

918
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,760
I'm getting anxious

919
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,150
at the thought of your leave

920
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,150
for six months.

921
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,430
I know.

922
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,230
And I can understand it.

923
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,560
So,

924
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,870
let me put it this way.

925
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,080
As long as I can work here,

926
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,190
I'm gonna fight till the end of the day.

927
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,870
During my maternity leave,

928
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,190
I'll definitely

929
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,760
make the project, the team

930
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,910
and the work all set.

931
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,430
I won't promise the performance will be great.

932
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,190
But I'll make sure

933
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,000
not to let the department fall behind.

934
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,800
Alright.

935
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,910
I feel a lot more secure

936
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,390
as you say it.

937
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,190
Then if I'll do something

938
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,790
to make you

939
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,270
feel upset next,

940
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,630
don't take it personally, either.

941
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,790
I won't.

942
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,000
If I get emotional,

943
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,790
it must be due to high progesterone.

944
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,040
Please understand it.

945
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,880
You know,

946
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,040
don't make me sit in on the internal meeting

947
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,790
of your department again.

948
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,830
I could have used the time to develop

949
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,310
two more projects.

950
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,880
Rachel gave me a stupid idea this time.

951
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,790
Now the whole family

952
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,710
are way joyful

953
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,670
for my mom's pregnancy.

954
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,440
They always wear big smiles

955
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,960
that I can't bear with it.

956
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,880
My aunt came from our hometown

957
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,670
to take care of my mom.

958
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,710
She made the braised fish,

959
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,150
yet I'm not allowed

960
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,150
to eat more.

961
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,230
She said it was for my mom.

962
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,230
No need to be mad.

963
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,400
Don't go back home for dinner tonight.

964
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
I'll buy you some grilled fish.

965
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,710
I didn't say it

966
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,960
for that dish.

967
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,230
I get it.

968
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,600
You're not mad at the dish.

969
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,830
You just feel upset.

970
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,960
I support you.

971
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,230
Yes.

972
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,750
My status in the family

973
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,270
was won by myself.

974
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,560
How did you do it?

975
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,710
I'll tell you.

976
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,400
Remind them

977
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
frequently.

978
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,480
They can't only care the second child and ignore the first one.

979
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,710
They've to care

980
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,600
the first child,

981
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,670
then

982
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,560
the second one.

983
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,350
They've to

984
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,520
be fair at home.

985
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,150
Just say these words

986
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,880
in front of them more often.

987
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,920
Is this workable?

988
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,080
They're adults,

989
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,000
smarter than us.

990
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,400
Well, it depends on the time you say.

991
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,480
You've to say it

992
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,440
at the right time.

993
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,000
Listen.

994
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,880
Here is a trick.

995
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,190
For example,

996
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,880
my parents may tell me off.

997
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,880
He Lu,

998
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,440
why didn't you do the exam well?

999
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,000
Then I'll say

1000
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,520
you all care so much

1001
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,350
on my brother.

1002
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,880
You've not paid attention

1003
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,040
to my study at all.

1004
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,350
Now you're

1005
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,440
asking me why?

1006
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,350
You can be an actress.

1007
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,400
These are my tricks.

1008
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,040
If you

1009
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,520
don't do well next time,

1010
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,600
tell your mom and dad that.

1011
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,520
Yunjie,

1012
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,710
Ms. Xue asked you

1013
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,040
to go to the office.

1014
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,480
Let's go.

1015
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,830
Why does Ms. Xue need to meet her?

1016
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,400
Didn't she do well in the exam?

1017
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,920
You failed either, didn't you?

1018
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,670
You're even at the bottom of the score.

1019
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,560
Mind your own business.

1020
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,080
Yunjie,

1021
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,190
you scores are poor this time.

1022
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,400
I don't think

1023
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,830
you've focused

1024
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,960
on your studies lately.

1025
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,630
You failed in the exam twice in a row.

1026
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
You were still among top students

1027
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,960
for studying new knowledge during last semester.

1028
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,310
Why did you

1029
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,560
lag behind

1030
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,310
in the review stage?

1031
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,350
How disappointed your parents will be?

1032
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,790
As a Chinese teacher,

1033
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,560
I favor you a lot.

1034
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,310
You have

1035
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,000
better literary quality.

1036
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,880
I don't require you to be a top student,

1037
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
But you shouldn't

1038
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,790
fall too far behind.

1039
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,790
I'll rearrange seats of the class.

1040
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,520
Don't sit

1041
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,630
with He Lu.

1042
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,560
I'll arrange you as Zhu Kexin's deskmate.

1043
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,960
She's got good grades.

1044
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,230
Hope you can learn from the good student

1045
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,630
and improve your grades as soon as possible.

1046
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,080
Do you understand?

1047
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,670
Yes.

1048
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,120
Thank you, Ms. Xue.

1049
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,920
I'll be talking

1050
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,670
to your mom about your performance, too.

1051
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:54,830
Don't!

1052
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,150
Ms. Xue,

1053
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,190
my mom's been occupied lately.

1054
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,080
Does she have something

1055
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,310
more important

1056
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,190
than your study?

1057
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,710
Our family

1058
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,120
is gonna have

1059
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,480
another child soon.

1060
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,480
Come in.

1061
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,190
Mr. Qian.

1062
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,000
Mr. Qian.

1063
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,310
I just received

1064
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,880
the salary information of this month.

1065
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,230
But only half of my commission

1066
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,790
is paid, why?

1067
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,120
Well,

1068
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,350
you go to the finance account department

1069
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,150
to open an account.

1070
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,440
The wealth management products

1071
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,230
of the amount will be transferred to you.

1072
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,880
I don't want the products.

1073
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,080
I need cash.

1074
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,560
All employees of our company

1075
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,080
have a financial account.

1076
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,040
And it has revenues.

1077
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,190
Much higher than the yield of depositing them in the bank.

1078
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,790
If there're written rules,

1079
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
please show me.

1080
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,270
You're my subordinate.

1081
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,630
You've to play by my rules.

1082
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,790
If you want it, okay.

1083
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,400
If not, that's your loss.

1084
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,790
If so,

1085
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,520
may I

1086
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,630
complain to

1087
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,400
the head office

1088
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,230
or labor arbitration department?

1089
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,830
Chen Wanzhen,

1090
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,400
don't you want the job?

1091
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,920
Mr. Qian, to be honest.

1092
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,790
I'm worried

1093
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,790
as so many wealth management products are released.

1094
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,830
In case there's a run on a bank,

1095
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,440
what should we do?

1096
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,440
Our company is large,

1097
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,000
and with so many real estate projects.

1098
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
We don't need

1099
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,000
you to give your advice here.

1100
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,630
You're in the management.

1101
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,560
I bet you know it's not that profitable

1102
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,880
to sell real estates.

1103
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,190
I know you studied finance.

1104
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,350
If you wanna work here, it's okay.

1105
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,560
If not, you can quit.

1106
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,710
Don't mess around here.

1107
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,880
Moreover,

1108
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,560
don't say openly

1109
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,790
about what you just mentioned.

1110
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,880
Or, I'll fire you at any time.

1111
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,600
Believe it or not?

1112
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,040
You can fire me.

1113
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,190
But I need

1114
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,830
to get my commission.

1115
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,000
If I can't get it,

1116
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,880
I'll stay

1117
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,670
and see

1118
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,040
if the revenue of wealth management products

1119
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,880
is that promising

1120
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,270
like you said.

1121
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The score is not good.

1122
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,230
She...

1123
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,270
She didn't do well this time.

1124
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,350
We caught up with the teaching schedule

1125
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,630
last semester.

1126
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,710
The lessons were taught much in a short time.

1127
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,560
Many students fell behind on their studies.

1128
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,440
But Yunjie did well

1129
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,190
at that time.

1130
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,270
She was even

1131
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,880
among the top 20 percent of students in the class.

1132
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,920
But lately

1133
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,790
we were in the overall review phase.

1134
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,080
She wasn't doing well

1135
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,440
twice in a row.

1136
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,630
Was something

1137
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,230
going on at home?

1138
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,350
Her grandpa got sick some time ago.

1139
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,310
And her aunt had a premature labor.

1140
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,270
The family was in chaos.

1141
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,920
I guess her dad cared less about her.

1142
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,190
It maybe won't last long.

1143
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,670
This knowledge

1144
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,750
should be reviewed more.

1145
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,190
Yes.

1146
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,190
One more thing I wanna ask.

1147
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,630
Yunjie said

1148
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,150
you were pregnant.

1149
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,670
Yes.

1150
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,670
I've just got pregnant for a short time.

1151
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,400
I was doing fetus protection a couple of days ago.

1152
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,000
She might be

1153
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,120
affected by this.

1154
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I can understand it.

1155
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,120
I've been a head teacher for long.

1156
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,040
Now

1157
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,630
the birth policy is relaxed.

1158
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,830
More and more families

1159
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,670
are in the same situation like yours.

1160
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,000
Many parents

1161
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,150
choose to have another child.

1162
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,150
It's your choice.

1163
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,350
But it's a key period

1164
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,350
of the high school entrance examination for Yunjie.

1165
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,560
Please pay more attention to her, too.

1166
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,960
The baby is still

1167
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,350
unborn after all.

1168
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,600
Exactly.

1169
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,350
Not born.

1170
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,000
When students play games,

1171
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,270
it goes around

1172
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,190
among them

1173
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,080
a joke.

1174
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,150
It tells us something.

1175
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,920
It goes "the first child is the main account

1176
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,440
while the second one is an alt account.

1177
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,440
Even the parents are busy

1178
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,190
with the second,

1179
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,480
the first child cannot be neglected."

1180
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,150
No.

1181
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,230
We won't.

1182
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,710
Honey,

1183
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,270
coming back for dinner?

1184
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,560
How about I ask my sister to cook some meat dishes?

1185
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,630
You've even got time to think about the dishes?

1186
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,830
Have you checked messages in the parent WeChat group?

1187
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,350
WeChat group?

1188
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,190
What did they say?

1189
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,350
I knew you hadn't watched it.

1190
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,230
Wang Zhe's mom said

1191
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,190
there was a lecture

1192
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,230
about mathematical logical thinking.

1193
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,880
I know it.

1194
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,600
I'm planning

1195
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,350
to talk to you about it.

1196
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,270
No need to talk to me about it, okay?

1197
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,080
You're responsible

1198
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,350
for Yunjie's study, aren't you?

1199
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,080
You know

1200
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,000
where I am?

1201
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,880
I'm at school.

1202
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,710
I was called by the teacher to the school again.

1203
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,560
The teacher asked you to go again.

1204
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,440
Why does she call you to go there a lot?

1205
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
You know what?

1206
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,230
It means you're not doing a good job.

1207
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,560
You're talking to me

1208
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,520
about the lecture?

1209
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,880
Tell me. What's your decision?

1210
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,520
What's your plan?

1211
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,310
Calm down.

1212
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,230
Don't be angry.

1213
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,520
So,

1214
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,440
let's sign up.

1215
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,230
Okay?

1216
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,080
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

1217
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,190
If you can't talk Yunjie in,

1218
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,880
just wait and see what will happen tonight.

1219
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:34,880
What's wrong?

1220
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,080
Why was she so upset?

1221
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,120
Hello, Wang Zhe's mom?
