English subtitles are available

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:45,530
Just in Time EP09

3
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,160
I've had enough!

4
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,520
Stop!

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,999
Honey,

6
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:03,719
I'm coming.

7
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm coming.

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,079
Here they are.

9
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:06,520
Honey, look

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,760
at these big, red cherries.

11
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,359
They're super sweet,

12
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,040
the highest grade,

13
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,999
as big as pigeon eggs,

14
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:10,760
absolutely delicious.

15
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,719
Who told you to buy this?

16
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:13,439
Are you trying to raise my blood sugar

17
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:13,999
even higher?

18
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,279
Do you want me to die?

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,600
Honey.

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,160
Wait!

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
Do you want me to die

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,719
so you can find someone else?

23
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,039
Honey,

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
don't talk like that.

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,080
Sit down.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,800
Don't be mad.

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,559
We're not eating it.

28
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,279
It's too sweet and it'll make throat dry.

29
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,520
We won't eat this.

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,480
Your favorite brand of shoes

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,080
has a new collection. It's beautiful.

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
It's like crystal boats,

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,279
all sparkly.

34
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,080
Jia Haowen,

35
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,759
are you trying to annoy me on purpose?

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,200
My feet are already

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,960
swollen.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Crystal boats?

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,319
I want crystal shoes.

40
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,159
Alright.

41
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:45,920
Honey.

42
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,120
We won't wear them.

43
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,480
After we have the baby, swelling goes down,

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,159
then we'll wear them.

45
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:50,800
Let's just buy them

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,719
and keep them at home to look at.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Let's go buy a bag.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,360
A new collection.

49
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,120
It's beautiful.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,360
A popular beach bag,

51
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,920
very roomy.

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,719
Are you saying I'm good at acting?

53
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,759
You are saying I'm good at acting.

54
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,960
Jia Haowen!

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,719
You've learned

56
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,279
to insult people indirectly now.

57
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,520
Honey,

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,319
I wouldn't dare!

59
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,039
You can scold me directly,

60
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,960
no need for indirect insults.

61
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,520
You can even hit me

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,439
if you want!

63
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,520
Honey...

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,839
Darling...

65
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,879
Give me a knife.

66
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,120
I'll cut everything in the house in half.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,960
Let's live separately.

68
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:37,960
Honey.

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,719
Don't touch me.

70
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,279
Live separately.

71
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,120
Honey,

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,120
let's go buy a house.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,080
The apartment you like the most.

74
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
Let's go buy a house.

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,879
Live separately.

76
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:19,599
Honey,

77
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:20,800
don't eat too much.

78
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,960
It's too sweet.

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,199
It is the most

80
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,879
in-demand layout.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Three large rooms, with great lighting

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,999
and ventilation, an open kitchen and bathroom.

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,160
Perfect for both investment and living.

84
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,399
But there aren't

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,399
many left.

86
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,399
Did you hear that?

87
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,879
Not many left.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,120
Got it, honey.

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,959
I'll pay right away.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,280
Yanzi,

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
take Mr. Jia to sign the contract.

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,879
Alright, where is it?

93
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,920
I use my strategy

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,600
to get this house.

95
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,199
What's this, a bitter scheme?

96
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,319
Who cares?

97
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,480
He said he'd buy me an apartment.

98
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,999
Let's finalize it quickly.

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,720
Mengxin,

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,639
I know you're thinking of me.

101
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,959
I just have performance pressure.

102
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,519
Please, don't think that way.

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,439
I've always

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,519
wanted to have a house

105
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,720
of my own,

106
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,319
a place I could decorate

107
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,360
and design according

108
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,120
to my tastes,

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,160
to turn it

110
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,519
into the home of my dreams.

111
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,480
You know,

112
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,559
after having kids,

113
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,879
everything starts to revolve around them.

114
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,040
I just wanted a space

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,079
where everything

116
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,280
is what I like.

117
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,720
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,879
Now your dream

119
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,959
has finally come true.

120
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,879
Thanks to you.

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,959
Mengxin,

122
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,680
this is the first house I've sold

123
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,519
since I became a real estate agent,

124
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,959
and it's all thanks to you.

125
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Once I get the commission,

126
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,840
I'll treat you to a big meal.

127
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,399
Yeah!

128
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,639
Actually, I should be thanking you.

129
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,759
It was your idea

130
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,040
to invest in real estate

131
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,759
that inspired me.

132
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,959
Did you know?

133
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:49,959
Haoze's mom

134
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,959
got kicked out of the villa.

135
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,840
And now, another woman

136
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,280
has moved in.

137
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
She even brought her child.

138
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,639
I heard Haoze's mom

139
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,800
is now staying

140
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
in a hotel with her child.

141
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,999
I need to be prepared, too.

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,360
I've been hearing too much gossip lately.

143
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,879
The more I hear, the more uneasy I feel.

144
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,879
Mengxin, you're always

145
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,600
listening to this gossip every day.

146
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,879
Is this for prenatal education?

147
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,480
No, I...

148
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm just killing time.

149
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,720
How's it going with the baby's dad?

150
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,600
How are the talks?

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,800
Still talking.

152
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:19,840
Let me tell you,

153
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,399
you must fight for the best

154
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,399
interests for yourself and the child.

155
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,120
Don't ever suffer losses

156
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,480
in the name of so-called dignity.

157
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,240
If it doesn't work out,

158
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,040
get a lawyer to help you.

159
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,999
I understand.

160
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,759
Alright then.

161
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,759
Just take good care

162
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,600
of yourself first.

163
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,519
Chen Wanzhen.

164
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,800
Haven't you finished these yet?

165
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
I'll do it.

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,959
You haven't transferred to sales yet.

167
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,280
Shouldn't you at least finish

168
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
your work first?

169
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,360
Ms.,should this water

170
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,959
be placed in this room?

171
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,240
I'll do it.

172
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
It'll be done soon.

173
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,120
I'll take you there.

174
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay.

175
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
She really thinks she's special.

176
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:41,840
Mom.

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,999
I finished my homework.

178
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,120
But you haven't finished yours.

179
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,720
Try doing homework

180
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,399
for three people.

181
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,280
Why should I do homework for three?

182
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:48,879
And our teacher

183
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,999
wouldn't agree that.

184
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,840
That's the difference

185
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,519
between a boss and a teacher.

186
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,040
So cherish it.

187
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
Study hard,

188
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,160
or one day

189
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,120
you'll work for a boss.

190
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,319
Then you'll have something to cry about.

191
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
I knew it.

192
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,319
You always end up saying

193
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,680
"study hard."

194
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
All moms are like this.

195
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,360
Dad, sign this for me.

196
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
Is my handwriting that bad?

197
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,999
Ask your mom.

198
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,959
Her signature looks great.

199
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,439
Don't you feel guilty?

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
What are you saying?

201
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:22,399
So rude.

202
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,519
Fine, I'll sign it myself.

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,720
What are you doing?

204
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,639
What's wrong?

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
She wants to sign it herself.

206
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,480
I'll sign it.

207
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,999
I have good handwriting.

208
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,519
At least for my name.

209
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,600
Tomorrow, take Yunjie

210
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,680
to visit my parents.

211
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,519
My Dad called.

212
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,639
He said he wants to cook something nice.

213
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,960
What about you?

214
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm not going.

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,519
I'll come pick you up later.

216
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,799
We need to keep the pregnancy a secret.

217
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,480
I should also avoid

218
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
hanging around them.

219
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,879
I'm showing signs now.

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,679
They're experienced.

221
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,320
They can tell right away.

222
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,200
I was just thinking,

223
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,080
if there's surgery,

224
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,159
what about Yunjie?

225
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,999
Maybe

226
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,600
we could send her to my parents' place.

227
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,399
Then we can tell them

228
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,879
we're going back to our hometown

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,519
to visit my sister and brother-in-law.

230
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,480
It's sister.

231
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,879
Not answering.

232
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,519
Not answering.

233
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
That's not good.

234
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,720
It's bedtime.

235
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:39,919
It's so late.

236
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,279
What if something happens?

237
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,159
What could happen?

238
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,720
Sister.

239
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,320
Are you asleep?

240
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,279
Not yet.

241
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,360
Li Lin is here too. Look.

242
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,039
Sis,

243
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,799
you're still awake.

244
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,519
I thought

245
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,120
you won't go to bed so early.

246
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,279
Take a look

247
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,480
at what I make for you.

248
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,999
Black sesame balls.

249
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Lin and Xu.

250
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,999
Strictly speaking,

251
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,999
this isn't really medicine.

252
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
But it doesn't taste bad.

253
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,159
It's actually very tasty.

254
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,279
Black sesame, walnuts, dates,

255
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,200
and donkey-hide gelatin.

256
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,120
They all help nourish and boost blood.

257
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,080
Sis.

258
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,679
Well,

259
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,919
if we want something,

260
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,999
we'll just buy it ourselves.

261
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,840
You don't need to worry.

262
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,999
It's not necessary.

263
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,759
Sis.

264
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,840
How did you know

265
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,279
I need to boost my energy and blood?

266
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,120
Homemade is

267
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,279
always the best.

268
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,360
Thank you.

269
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,960
Please send it to me later.

270
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,320
Meng'an is really understanding.

271
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
Meng'an, I heard

272
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,560
your menopause started early.

273
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,759
It's depleting your energy and blood.

274
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,679
Just eating these isn't enough.

275
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,679
You need to get a pulse diagnosis.

276
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,279
I'll come over to your place

277
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,840
and give you a proper check-up.

278
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,600
I'll send it to you later.

279
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,240
Okay.

280
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,999
Alright.

281
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,960
Rest well, bye.

282
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,960
This

283
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,999
is unnecessary worry.

284
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,480
What did you say to your sister?

285
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,759
I went home last week.

286
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,320
Your mom heard about your early menopause

287
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,279
and insisted I ask brother-in-law

288
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:11,960
for a prescription

289
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
to help you with it.

290
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,279
Mom told me to call.

291
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,639
I couldn't just ignore it.

292
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Right?

293
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
I didn't say anything else.

294
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,560
Li Lin, I warn you,

295
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,120
if you dare privately...

296
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,159
It's impossible.

297
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,720
You know what kind of person I am.

298
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,560
I will never let my sister

299
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,120
get involved in our family matters.

300
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,560
You know that.

301
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,840
That's just how my sister is.

302
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,679
Always meddling.

303
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,320
She drives me crazy.

304
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,999
I've been annoyed since I was a kid.

305
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
She's the one who raised you.

306
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,519
So heartless.

307
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,360
We can't be like him.

308
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,080
This bow

309
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,679
looks nice, doesn't it?

310
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,960
Lin, did you take Meng'an

311
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,039
to see a traditional Chinese doctor

312
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,720
for her illness?

313
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:22,960
My sister

314
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,639
sent some tonics

315
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,679
for her.

316
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,440
She said next time

317
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,639
when brother-in-law

318
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,600
comes here,

319
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,679
he'll check on her.

320
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,320
Don't we have a traditional Chinese doctor here?

321
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,320
Do we really have to wait until then?

322
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:35,519
Fine.

323
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,480
She's pretty busy this week.

324
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,080
She'll be on vacation next week.

325
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,519
I'll take her to see a doctor then.

326
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,399
We're supposed to visit Auntie back home.

327
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,679
Yeah.

328
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,720
That's what I said.

329
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:47,999
Next week

330
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,600
we'll go back and visit them.

331
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,080
By the way,

332
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
we'll ask your uncle

333
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,720
to check on your mom.

334
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,120
You have to know that traditional Chinese medicine

335
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,480
isn't something that works

336
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,519
in just one or two sessions.

337
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,200
How long is

338
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
her annual leave?

339
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,399
Two weeks.

340
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,519
Two weeks?

341
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,320
Why don't you ask her to stay here?

342
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,480
No need.

343
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,320
Staying here would just trouble you all.

344
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,360
At home,

345
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,759
I can take good care of her.

346
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
What trouble?

347
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,200
Just go back and have a look.

348
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,320
How long has it been since last visit?

349
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,560
Stay a few more days.

350
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,159
See how capable my dad is?

351
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,279
He just got a new job,

352
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:26,840
and already he can take a vacation.

353
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,560
There's another one over there.

354
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
There's another one over there.

355
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,720
So beautiful, I can't even choose.

356
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,120
Are there more of these fish?

357
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:34,720
Yes.

358
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,080
Mu.

359
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,480
Come over here.

360
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,240
There's some work

361
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,279
I need to hand over to you.

362
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,360
Have you submitted promotion application?

363
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:21,679
Yes, I have.

364
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,200
Thank you, Ms. Xu,

365
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,960
for giving me this opportunity.

366
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,560
It's not me giving you the opportunity.

367
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,840
It's the result

368
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,720
of your own hard work.

369
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,080
This USB drive contains

370
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,159
several projects

371
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,120
we've been working on recently.

372
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm taking two weeks off.

373
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,679
You'll be in charge of these projects.

374
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,320
Can I handle it?

375
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
You won't be around.

376
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,159
What if I'm unsure about something?

377
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,960
Can I call you?

378
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,720
Can you call me

379
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,759
for the rest of your life?

380
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,039
Mu,

381
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,279
I have no doubt about your abilities.

382
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,360
I trust my judgment.

383
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,120
You must trust yourself even more.

384
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,200
As a department head,

385
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,399
besides having strong

386
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,279
professional skills,

387
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,600
you also need decisiveness and judgment.

388
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
More importantly, you need

389
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,279
the ability to take responsibility.

390
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,159
Understand?

391
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,799
Got it.

392
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
If there's something you can't handle,

393
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,519
you can call me.

394
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,560
I will help you.

395
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,759
Okay.

396
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,560
Go ahead.

397
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:20,440
Alright.

398
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,440
Does it look good?

399
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,120
Let me see.

400
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,879
It looks great.

401
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,720
You're wearing too much

402
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,560
around your neck.

403
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,480
We're leaving now.

404
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,519
Come back early, okay?

405
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,120
Sure.

406
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,639
Xin,

407
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,159
we're going for a walk.

408
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,840
Do you want to come with us?

409
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,480
Wanna join us?

410
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,639
No, you go ahead.

411
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,519
Alright.

412
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,600
Take care.

413
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Be safe.

414
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,120
Don't worry.

415
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,480
Why are you here instead

416
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
of staying at mom and dad's?

417
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
Did you get into a fight again?

418
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,159
I came to check on you.

419
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,080
Check on me?

420
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,480
What's so interesting about me?

421
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,279
You're reacting.

422
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,679
Reacting? What do you mean?

423
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,519
Why are you staring at me like that?

424
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,720
Is there something on my face?

425
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,879
It's in your belly.

426
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,960
Who told you?

427
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,720
No one told me.

428
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,360
I guessed it myself.

429
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,480
You have that kind of ability?

430
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Of course.

431
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,560
While cleaning the yard, mom said

432
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,879
you were going through menopause

433
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
and asked traditional Chinese doctor

434
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,960
to check you out.

435
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,360
But brother-in-law was hesitant,

436
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:17,280
saying it wasn't necessary.

437
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,199
Then he said Meng'an

438
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,479
had taken two weeks of vacation.

439
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,320
And back to hometown for a check-up.

440
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,679
That was too funny.

441
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,320
I figured it out immediately.

442
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,159
As a workaholic,

443
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,360
you would you take a vacation

444
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
for this?

445
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,199
Could I believe it?

446
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,399
It's ridiculous.

447
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,919
Can't even lie properly,

448
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:37,760
can he?

449
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:38,719
No.

450
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,159
I'm just too smart.

451
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,520
I figured it out in an instant.

452
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,879
Sorting vegetables, brother-in-law?

453
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,879
Thanks for your hard work.

454
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,600
No worries.

455
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,399
It's no big deal.

456
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:49,879
Need help?

457
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:50,320
No need.

458
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
You go rest.

459
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
My sister is pregnant.

460
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,320
And she doesn't want to keep it.

461
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,320
I guess it all right.

462
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,520
I'm telling you, Li Lin.

463
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,639
If my sister doesn't want it,

464
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:16,800
you better not force her.

465
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,439
My sister is different from me.

466
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,719
She's a career woman.

467
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,679
The right to choose motherhood

468
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,399
must be in the hands of

469
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:22,679
us women ourselves.

470
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:23,560
Got it?

471
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,080
Remember that.

472
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,000
Why hire paparazzi?

473
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,719
I think you're better than them.

474
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,760
They just take pictures,

475
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
and you also do the analysis.

476
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,479
I'll continue analyzing.

477
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,120
You don't want it, right?

478
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,280
Why wouldn't I want it?

479
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,800
You do want it?

480
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,959
Why wouldn't I want it?

481
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,320
You're getting older.

482
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,360
You're already 40.

483
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,159
So what if I'm 40?

484
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,560
If I can still get pregnant at 40,

485
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,320
it means I'm in good health.

486
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:15,320
Alright.

487
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,760
You're amazing.

488
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,080
You're healthy.

489
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,600
But I'm not discussing

490
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,479
whether you can conceive or not.

491
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,280
I'm discussing

492
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,399
whether you should give birth or not.

493
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,639
You're 40.

494
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,280
You give birth,

495
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,719
and after that,

496
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,479
can you recover?

497
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,399
Will you be able to bounce back?

498
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,879
You can't recover.

499
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,040
I'm asking you,

500
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,600
after giving birth,

501
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,000
will you still work?

502
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,120
Of course, I'll still work.

503
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:39,959
I'm not like you.

504
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,679
Fine.

505
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:41,600
You'll work, but you'll need at least

506
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,959
three to five years to recover, right?

507
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,080
At least until kid starts school, right?

508
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,360
When the child starts school,

509
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,120
you won't have to worry business.

510
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,280
By then, you should be retired.

511
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,399
What job will you still have?

512
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,080
I'm not that old and I won't be retired.

513
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,000
Alright, not that old.

514
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,080
Almost 50, maybe.

515
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,080
What company

516
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,719
would hire someone who's nearly 50?

517
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,360
After all the effort,

518
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,959
you find a job,

519
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:04,760
and after a few years,

520
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,360
you still retire.

521
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,679
Then why can you have a second child?

522
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,360
Right now,

523
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,479
I'm only 34 with my second child.

524
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:19,560
How old are you?

525
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,600
Can 30 and 40 be the same?

526
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,120
That's a big difference.

527
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,080
Think about it yourself.

528
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,199
After you gave birth to Yunjie,

529
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,719
was your body the same as before?

530
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,159
Definitely not the same.

531
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,120
Exactly.

532
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,959
And you were only in your 20 back then.

533
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
Now you're already 40.

534
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,439
You're already 40 now.

535
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,600
I now

536
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
can already foresee your future.

537
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,679
Mr. Zhang.

538
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,479
Sorry to keep you waiting.

539
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,560
Never mind.

540
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:01,879
Hello.

541
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:02,520
I just finished a meeting.

542
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Take a seat.

543
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,520
No worries, just waited a bit.

544
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,719
Please have a seat.

545
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:07,479
Take your time.

546
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,560
Here.

547
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,719
Have some tea.

548
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:16,719
Mr. Zhang.

549
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,320
I'm on the way.

550
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,199
Ten minutes.

551
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:20,320
At most ten minutes.

552
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,399
What are you doing?

553
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,239
Even the administrator

554
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,199
has to work overtime this weekend?

555
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,360
I was just working out there.

556
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,719
Mr. Zhang suddenly asked me to come over.

557
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,719
Do you know who I saw him with

558
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,159
at the café?

559
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,959
Huang Sisi.

560
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:56,879
You knew?

561
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,280
Mr. Zhang asked me about her.

562
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,479
There's no news from the headhunter yet.

563
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,639
But Huang Sisi's resume

564
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,520
is indeed impressive.

565
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,159
Not just well-crafted...

566
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,760
She's handled so many projects.

567
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,080
She must have some abilities.

568
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,320
But I've heard

569
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
she's not an easy one to deal with.

570
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,120
Over at Blue Ocean,

571
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,000
her affair with Mr. Yu

572
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,320
was quite a scandal.

573
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,760
She couldn't stay there anymore,

574
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,959
so she's looking for a new place.

575
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,679
With someone like her

576
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:24,959
coming to our company,

577
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,600
is it a good thing

578
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,959
or bad thing for you?

579
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,120
Ask for my opinion, huh?

580
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,719
So give me your stance.

581
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,719
Objectively speaking,

582
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,399
the position of content Deputy Director

583
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,959
really can't stay vacant.

584
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,120
Got it.

585
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,239
Mu's promotion request

586
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,399
has already come to me.

587
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,120
I'll go talk to him later.

588
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,959
You should bring it up to Mr. Zhang first.

589
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,120
If he settles it with Huang Sisi,

590
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,959
I won't be able to do anything about it.

591
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,159
Wait for me.

592
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,560
Mr. Zhang.

593
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,080
Come in.

594
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
Is this a good time?

595
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,719
I want to talk to you about Mu.

596
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,520
Hasn't the layoffs ended?

597
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,719
And Mu's performance

598
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,360
has been pretty good.

599
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,320
You're going to lay him off?

600
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,159
No, I'm not laying him off.

601
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,320
I just want to talk to you

602
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,360
about promoting Mu.

603
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,120
Then let's sit and talk.

604
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,399
Where do you want to promote him to?

605
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,760
Since the Content Department was merged,

606
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,159
we've been missing a Deputy Director.

607
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,280
I was thinking

608
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:34,600
that Mu is quite

609
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
steady

610
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,879
and loyal.

611
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,560
He has a vibrant mindset.

612
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,800
His approach is different from

613
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,879
traditional media.

614
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,000
He's been with the company for three years

615
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,479
and has always been a good team player.

616
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,679
We've had a good understanding.

617
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:46,959
So I was thinking

618
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,600
maybe we could

619
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,080
promote him

620
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,719
to Deputy Director.

621
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,840
That's quite a leap.

622
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,560
You just said he's a kid and has only been

623
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,959
with the company for three years.

624
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,199
You want to promote him

625
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:58,959
to that position?

626
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,520
His experience is a bit shallow.

627
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,320
His experience

628
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,560
is indeed a bit shallow.

629
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,080
But this is a special time, right?

630
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:09,159
The company just finished the layoffs.

631
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,639
Everyone who needed to go has left.

632
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,479
So shouldn't we

633
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,800
reward someone?

634
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,800
Right?

635
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,600
This could also

636
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,199
boost everyone's morale.

637
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,159
if you encourage him.

638
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,399
why not just pay him?

639
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:19,159
Why did you want

640
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,239
to give him a promotion?

641
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,159
Money

642
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,800
would be nice.

643
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:27,719
But, you see,

644
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:28,959
I need to take a vacation.

645
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,159
So if I'm

646
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,399
not around,

647
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:32,040
someone has to manage the company.

648
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,520
Wait

649
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,320
a minute.

650
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,679
When did I

651
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:35,800
approve your vacation?

652
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,719
Last time when I asked for leave,

653
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,399
you said,

654
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,520
after completing that bid,

655
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,959
I could take a break.

656
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,320
Did I?

657
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,080
Mr. Zhang,

658
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,959
that's not quite fair.

659
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,439
You're just tired and looking

660
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,600
for someone to share workload.

661
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,639
Alright.

662
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,080
Go on your vacation then.

663
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,080
The company cover your travel expenses.

664
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,360
All of them?

665
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,000
Meals won't be covered.

666
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,080
Who knows what you'll eat?

667
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,719
We'll cover domestic travel expenses,

668
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,479
but if you're going abroad, that's on you.

669
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,280
Alright, what about Mu?

670
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,439
Take a proper vacation,

671
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:11,600
and we'll talk when you get back.

672
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:15,719
Anything else?

673
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,520
No, that's it.

674
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,879
Alright, I'm leaving.

675
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:19,439
Go ahead.

676
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,520
Don't tell anyone else.

677
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,959
This is a special perk

678
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,320
just for you from the company.

679
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,479
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

680
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,080
Sighing like that...

681
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,159
She seems unhappy with me, huh?

682
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,479
Everyone, please stop what you're doing.

683
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:43,959
I have an announcement.

684
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,679
Chen Wanzhen is officially

685
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,879
joining us starting today.

686
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:47,959
Let's give her a warm welcome.

687
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,280
Hello, everyone.

688
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,879
Wanzhen,

689
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,399
this will be your desk from now on.

690
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,719
And here's your work card.

691
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,560
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

692
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,719
After your probation period,

693
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,719
we'll sign a formal contract.

694
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:00,199
Okay.

695
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,159
Everyone, get back to work.

696
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
Please take care of me, everyone.

697
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,679
Chen Wanzhen,

698
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,199
make 15 copies

699
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:23,959
and put them in the meeting room.

700
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,360
Sales department needs them.

701
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,959
Okay.

702
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,639
Hello, Mrs. Mo.

703
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,760
You've arrived?

704
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,719
I'll come out right away.

705
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,800
Mrs. Yu,

706
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,399
long time no see.

707
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,159
Yeah, it has been a while.

708
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,840
Are you

709
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,439
in the real estate business now?

710
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
No.

711
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,520
I'm just working here.

712
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
I'm doing sales now.

713
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,719
I see.

714
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:16,679
You must have been

715
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,159
resting at home for a long time,

716
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,040
and now

717
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,600
you're out to experience life.

718
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
The kids are grown up now,

719
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,800
so I decided to come out and work.

720
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,760
And how's

721
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,320
Mr. Yu's business going?

722
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,520
It seems like you

723
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,159
aren't living in the villa area anymore.

724
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,479
I'm living in the downtown now.

725
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,479
You know,

726
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,040
high-rise apartments in the downtown

727
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,120
have very high living standards.

728
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,679
Let me tell you,

729
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,959
my husband and I

730
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,520
are just thinking of buying

731
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,959
an apartment in the downtown for our son.

732
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,600
That's great!

733
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,520
Let me take you

734
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,159
to see the model unit.

735
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:46,399
Come on.

736
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:46,800
Let's go.

737
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,439
Mo, come along and have a look.

738
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
You go ahead.

739
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,879
I'm waiting for a call.

740
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,800
Okay.

741
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,120
Men are all about work.

742
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,320
Mrs. Mo, I'll take you there.

743
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:55,879
Let's go.

744
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:56,120
Sure.

745
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,560
Let's go.

746
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,040
Mrs. Mo,

747
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:58,679
What type

748
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,439
of layout do you want?

749
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,040
And how big an area?

750
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,000
I'll explain everything to you.

751
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,679
Sounds good.

752
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,320
Mr. Yu,

753
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,560
what's going on with your family?

754
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Covering vacation expenses?

755
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,760
Even the stingiest man is spending money.

756
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,000
Only you could pull this off.

757
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:16,560
You've got some skills.

758
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,520
I think he's feeling guilty.

759
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:20,800
Making up for whole thing of Huang Sisi.

760
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,439
Huang Sisi?

761
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,120
No chance.

762
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,760
Any news?

763
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,159
Mr. Zhang couldn't win her over.

764
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:27,959
First, she's still

765
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,959
at Blue Ocean and hasn't resigned.

766
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,639
Second,

767
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,679
she's already a director there.

768
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,840
In terms of position and salary she wants,

769
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,639
Mr. Zhang can't meet that.

770
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
I mentioned the matter with Mu.

771
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,280
He did say

772
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,520
he'd make proper arrangements.

773
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,159
So there's still hope!

774
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,560
You should've done this a long time ago.

775
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,879
Develop your own people.

776
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:49,280
Build your own team.

777
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,239
More efficient work.

778
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,120
Isn't that great?

779
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,600
And it prevents outsiders

780
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,360
from taking your credit

781
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,199
and your share.

782
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,000
Does this sound like

783
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,239
something an HR director

784
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,639
should say?

785
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,040
In this field,

786
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,280
you're not as good as me.

787
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,040
I'm just doing it for the company

788
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,479
to build a stable

789
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,600
and strong talent pipeline, alright?

790
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,320
As for Huang Sisi,

791
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,000
she's competent.

792
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,959
But she's a bit of a wild card.

793
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,719
In my opinion,

794
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,239
even if we hire her,

795
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,120
we need to be cautious.

796
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,199
When are you having the surgery?

797
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,879
I haven't decided yet.

798
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,280
Still haven't decided.

799
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,919
You're being so indecisive.

800
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,159
That's not like you.

801
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,520
I think you should have the baby.

802
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,199
If I were you, I'd go for it.

803
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,479
You want a baby?

804
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,800
Just find a man and have one.

805
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,959
But I need to find one first.

806
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
Aren't men easy to find?

807
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,879
It's actually quite hard.

808
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,800
I'm doing fine on my own right now.

809
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,959
I'm quite happy living alone.

810
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,120
Finding someone

811
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,360
might not make my life better.

812
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,719
If it's going to be worse,

813
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:52,800
why would I look for someone?

814
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,719
Not necessarily.

815
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,639
Look at me and Li Lin.

816
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:56,679
Aren't we doing just fine?

817
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,520
If all men were like Li Lin,

818
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,520
the whole world would be celebrating.

819
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,399
Otherwise, just give Li Lin

820
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,080
to me.

821
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,120
I don't mind that he's a second marriage.

822
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,399
Get lost.

823
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:11,760
I'm not done talking.

824
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:13,719
I've decided.

825
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,280
When I turn 40,

826
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,159
I'll find a man

827
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,040
and have a child.

828
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:19,159
The thing is

829
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,280
it'll help delay menopause.

830
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,919
But you also need

831
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,280
to have a good body like mine.

832
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,520
In this aspect, you're not as good as me.

833
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:26,560
Look at me now.

834
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,959
Working out

835
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,320
and delaying aging.

836
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:35,479
Mrs. Mo,

837
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,840
buying a house is a big deal.

838
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,959
You should think it over.

839
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:38,719
It's okay.

840
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,080
Here are

841
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,320
some materials about the property.

842
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,600
Take them home and take a look.

843
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,199
Give it to me.

844
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:44,760
What kind of floor and orientation

845
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,679
do you prefer?

846
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,439
I'll try

847
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:47,520
to reserve it for you.

848
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,760
Let me know

849
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,560
when you decide.

850
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,800
You can talk a bit more.

851
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,080
I'll check if the car has arrived.

852
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Goodbye, Mr. Mo.

853
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,280
Wanzhen,

854
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,000
your child is still so young,

855
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,320
and you're already working.

856
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,159
And you're working in sales.

857
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,600
What about

858
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,679
your husband's dignity?

859
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,560
I understand how you feel,

860
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:10,679
but our husbands

861
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,080
are all in business.

862
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,199
At least give him some respect.

863
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,159
It saves you

864
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:16,600
from being talked about outside.

865
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,000
Mrs. Mo,

866
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,479
not everyone

867
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,959
is as fortunate as you.

868
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,399
Every family has its troubles.

869
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:25,520
Yes.

870
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,760
I'll leave now.

871
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,800
I'll see you out.

872
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:28,239
Let's go.

873
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:37,479
Chen Wanzhen,

874
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:38,719
get in the car.

875
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,280
Go home.

876
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,320
What are you doing?

877
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,520
Get in the car.

878
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,520
Stop right there.

879
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,080
What are you doing?

880
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:48,159
You're really something.

881
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,800
Selling a house

882
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,719
to my friend.

883
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,560
Mrs. Mo is also my friend.

884
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,399
Do you know?

885
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,040
You're not just

886
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,959
disrespect yourself.

887
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,280
You're also disrespecting me.

888
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,719
Do you know that?

889
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,000
How did I disrespect?

890
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,320
Mr. Mo.

891
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,199
He just called me.

892
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:03,879
He asked if

893
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:04,760
there was a problem with the financing.

894
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,679
Why is my wife

895
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,719
selling houses here?

896
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
Mr. Mo is a veteran

897
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,159
in the investment field.

898
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,600
What he says carries weight.

899
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,320
Do you know?

900
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,439
How do you expect people to think of me?

901
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,679
I'm in the middle of financing.

902
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,719
Yu Hai, I'll say it again.

903
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,280
I want a divorce.

904
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,520
If you think it's embarrassing

905
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,560
that I'm selling houses,

906
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,399
or if it makes people doubt

907
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,120
your abilities,

908
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,719
I'll find a way to clear things up.

909
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,520
I'll say that you are

910
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
a bachelor

911
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,360
and that your ex-wife didn't take

912
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,959
a single share in your company.

913
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:28,679
It won't

914
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:29,679
affect your career.

915
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,520
Is that good enough?

916
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,520
Enough talk.

917
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Quit your job now.

918
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,280
Let go of me.

919
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,199
Are you out of your mind?

920
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,080
Mr. Zhang,

921
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm fine.

922
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,520
Zhenghao Teahouse, right?

923
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,600
Okay.

924
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,520
I'll be right over.

925
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:46,520
Yes.

926
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,560
Thank you for introducing

927
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,399
so many good friends last time.

928
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:49,959
Got it.

929
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,000
I'll have the driver come downstairs.

930
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,120
I'll be right there.

931
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,959
What's wrong with you?

932
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,239
Shopping should be fun.

933
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,679
Why do you always look so gloomy?

934
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,199
You're right.

935
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,239
I'm not happy at all

936
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,399
right now.

937
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,399
Why?

938
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,959
I'll let you in on a secret.

939
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,199
But don't tell anyone.

940
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,560
Yunjie.

941
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,199
He Lu.

942
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,560
I'm here.

943
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,080
I came at the right time, didn't I?

944
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,360
I know you guys are tired from shopping.

945
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,719
I brought you milk tea.

946
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,879
Yunjie.

947
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,080
You like this one.

948
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,879
He Lu, you're this one.

949
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,679
Is that right?

950
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Why does it always

951
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,959
seem so surprising

952
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,000
when you show up?

953
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:26,919
Let's go.

954
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,399
What's so surprising?

955
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,679
I showed up just in time.

956
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,280
I brought you milk tea when you're tired.

957
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:33,520
Wait a moment.

958
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,000
Here you go.

959
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,959
Thanks, Wu.

960
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,120
Clock out when it's time.

961
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,080
We're not a state-owned enterprise.

962
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,719
Isn't it off-duty time now?

963
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:04,560
Besides, my work

964
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,320
is already done.

965
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,600
There's no need to work overtime.

966
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
I have a viewing group later.

967
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,320
You need to handle the reception.

968
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,199
Fei.

969
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,040
Mr. Sun.

970
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:14,959
It'll be fine when I'm here.

971
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,439
Aren't you picking up the kids?

972
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,520
Hurry up.

973
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,719
That's not possible.

974
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,359
Mr. Qian just said

975
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,520
that

976
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,520
Wanzhen needs to stay for learning.

977
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,600
You can't just work

978
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,520
nine to five in sales.

979
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,639
Look here.

980
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,120
In our sales department,

981
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,480
no one leaves on time.

982
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,080
Do you really want to switch roles?

983
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,799
How about this?

984
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,440
Wanzhen, after picking up the kids,

985
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,520
come back right away.

986
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,960
I'll keep an eye on things here for you.

987
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,560
Is that okay?

988
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,480
Never mind, Mr. Sun.

989
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,679
I'll handle it myself.

990
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:47,560
Thank you.

991
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,719
And she still wants to switch to sales.

992
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,159
Hello, Wanzhen.

993
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,040
Mengxin.

994
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:11,000
Sorry.

995
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,120
I'm asking another favor.

996
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,560
I have to work overtime today.

997
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,839
Could you pick up Wan and Zhen

998
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,159
on your way?

999
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:17,480
No problem.

1000
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,799
I'm already at the school,

1001
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,279
waiting for them.

1002
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,040
That's great.

1003
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,120
Let them play

1004
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,960
at your place for a while.

1005
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,719
I'll pick them up

1006
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:24,719
after work.

1007
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,560
It's fine, don't worry.

1008
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,799
You focus on your work.

1009
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,480
Xiong wants to play

1010
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,159
with the older kids a bit longer.

1011
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,359
Thank you, Mengxin.

1012
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,719
No need to be polite.

1013
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,719
If anything like this happens again,

1014
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,799
just call me anytime.

1015
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:38,920
I'll let you know

1016
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,799
once I've picked them up.

1017
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,759
Okay.

1018
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,600
Bye.

1019
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:45,480
Bought the favorite toy car.

1020
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,120
Come on, Yunjie.

1021
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,520
Come in quickly.

1022
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,639
Grandson.

1023
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:49,359
In a moment...

1024
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,400
Hello, Grandma.

1025
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,199
Hello.

1026
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:52,920
Let's go.

1027
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,400
Hurry up.

1028
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,839
This is the secret you told me

1029
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:57,799
about your family?

1030
00:35:58,839 --> 00:35:59,759
You're my best friend.

1031
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,799
That's why I told you.

1032
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:02,000
You have to keep it a secret.

1033
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,319
Don't worry.

1034
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,080
As your best friend,

1035
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,960
I'll definitely keep it confidential.

1036
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,520
Good.

1037
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,600
You sit over there for now.

1038
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,520
I'll get you some snacks.

1039
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,199
Alright.

1040
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,040
Here.

1041
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,279
You have so many snacks at home.

1042
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,759
These aren't mine.

1043
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:23,080
They're the little prince's.

1044
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:24,120
Why do you always call your brother

1045
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,040
the little prince?

1046
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,960
Before he was born,

1047
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,880
I didn't even know

1048
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,120
we had a throne to inherit.

1049
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,920
Once he was born,

1050
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,960
I was completely sidelined.

1051
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:36,719
When I visited your house before,

1052
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,440
I hadn't heard

1053
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,520
that you had a younger brother.

1054
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,080
Not just you,

1055
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:41,159
even I only

1056
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,000
met my brother

1057
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,080
when he was one year old.

1058
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,199
Seriously?

1059
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,560
My parents had the second child

1060
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
without telling me.

1061
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:50,040
At that time, my parents tricked me,

1062
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,480
saying that my mom had just gained weight.

1063
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,839
Her belly was so big.

1064
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:53,960
I actually believed it.

1065
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,040
Later on,

1066
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,759
when my mom went back to her hometown,

1067
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:58,960
she stayed for several months.

1068
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,799
When she came back,

1069
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,480
my brother

1070
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,520
appeared out of nowhere.

1071
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,000
No wonder.

1072
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,880
I never

1073
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,000
saw your brother before.

1074
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,759
He was staying in the hometown before

1075
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:11,960
with my grandmother.

1076
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,080
Now,

1077
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,239
since he's starting kindergarten,

1078
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,400
we brought him back.

1079
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:17,880
Your brother seems pretty well-behaved.

1080
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,639
He even brought

1081
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,719
you snacks.

1082
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,279
Be grateful.

1083
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,560
What's so great about it?

1084
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,080
All these snacks

1085
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,880
are all bought by my grandma

1086
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,759
for my brother.

1087
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
But when I wanted a five-yuan hairpin,

1088
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,600
my grandma wouldn't buy it for me.

1089
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:30,480
Anyway,

1090
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,080
if my grandma won't give me money,

1091
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,359
I just ask her son for it.

1092
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,000
Eat more.

1093
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:35,839
I really didn't notice

1094
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,080
that your grandma is so biased.

1095
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,080
Of course.

1096
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,080
It's all about carrying on family line.

1097
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:41,799
But that's not right.

1098
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,120
Isn't it the woman who has the baby?

1099
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:44,400
You're right. But you can't

1100
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,520
have your mother's last name.

1101
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
So my grandma says

1102
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,799
only boys can carry on the family line.

1103
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,839
Girls,

1104
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,000
are someone else's.

1105
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,319
What century is this?

1106
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,759
Such feudal thinking!

1107
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,600
Anyway, my grandma says

1108
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,520
that money

1109
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,839
is reserved for Lulu

1110
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,080
as a dowry in the future.

1111
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:02,759
But the car and the house

1112
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:05,120
are all for my eldest grandson.

1113
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,799
Your grandma looks quite kind.

1114
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,080
But the things she says

1115
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,960
are really hard to explain.

1116
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,359
If you're the only child in your family,

1117
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,159
you won't have a sense of crisis.

1118
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,679
No one's competing with you,

1119
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,719
or trying to take anything from you.

1120
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,600
But that's not the case for me.

1121
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,440
Have your parents talked to you

1122
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,719
about having a second child?

1123
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,600
My mom is already in menopause.

1124
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,279
What about menopause?

1125
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,759
I read online that

1126
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:32,639
women can't have babies after menopause.

1127
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,799
That's actually a good thing.

1128
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,159
What's so good about it?

1129
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:36,080
It's a condition that needs treatment.

1130
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,279
It's quite troublesome.

1131
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,799
My mom still has to

1132
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:39,600
take time off

1133
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,799
to see a doctor.

1134
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,679
And they say

1135
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,080
that women in menopause have bad tempers.

1136
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,080
My mom already had a bad temper.

1137
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,520
It's probably going to get worse.

1138
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,480
I'll have a hard time in the future.

1139
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,199
Why is everything so difficult?

1140
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,080
Every family has its own troubles.

1141
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,279
Just forget about it.

1142
00:38:58,319 --> 00:38:59,719
Dinner's ready, Yunjie.

1143
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:01,520
Today we're having braised ribbon fish.

1144
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,719
Isn't your mom working overtime?

1145
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,759
You can eat at here.

1146
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,839
Stay and have dinner.

1147
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,799
Spend a bit more time with me.

1148
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:07,960
Alright.

1149
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,159
They're not coming back to eat.

1150
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,080
Should I still cook?

1151
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,319
Go ahead and cook.

1152
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,120
Who is it?

1153
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,440
It's me, your brother-in-law.

1154
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,480
Haowen.

1155
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,960
Great.

1156
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,960
You've brought something again.

1157
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,319
Of course.

1158
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:28,759
Come on in!

1159
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:29,279
Okay.

1160
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:30,679
I was just about to cook.

1161
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:31,600
Where's my sister?

1162
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,120
She's

1163
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,839
working overtime.

1164
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:34,520
And...

1165
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,159
What about Yunjie?

1166
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,839
She went to He Lu's house.

1167
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,520
Look,

1168
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,400
so many dishes.

1169
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,279
Isn't it a coincidence?

1170
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:40,440
Don't cook.

1171
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,560
I'll take you out to eat.

1172
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,759
I don't want to eat out.

1173
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:43,639
I'll be done here soon.

1174
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,359
Just sit for a while.

1175
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,199
So troublesome.

1176
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:45,960
For what?

1177
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,239
The smoke from the oil is unbearable.

1178
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,679
Cooking is not a hassle for me.

1179
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,719
I'll treat you to a big meal.

1180
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:52,359
Is it more barbecue?

1181
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:53,600
You choose.

1182
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:54,960
Is that true?

1183
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,120
Why would I lie to you?

1184
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,040
Let's go.

1185
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,440
Hmm.

1186
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:58,159
I

1187
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:58,880
I

1188
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,679
I

1189
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,799
have to change clothes.

1190
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:01,319
Change clothes.

1191
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,600
Alright, hurry up.

1192
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:03,880
Soup is coming.

1193
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,759
Yunjie,

1194
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,639
I have already talked

1195
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,199
to your mom.

1196
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,040
Just enjoy

1197
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,159
your meal at here.

1198
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,199
Thank you.

1199
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,319
You're welcome.

1200
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,000
Eat up.

1201
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,040
Your mom seems

1202
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,359
to have a good temper.

1203
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,440
You haven't seen her

1204
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,400
when she's angry.

1205
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,480
she and my grandma...

1206
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,920
Mom,

1207
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,799
you secretly gave Rui

1208
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:22,880
bone-strengthening powder again?

1209
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,520
That's all hormones and it's not good.

1210
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,560
Our child

1211
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,199
is shorter than others.

1212
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,199
Eating it might make him a bit stronger.

1213
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:29,960
Hormones won't help him

1214
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,799
grow taller.

1215
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:32,040
The children of your eldest sister

1216
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,520
all took it.

1217
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,639
Would I harm my

1218
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,520
precious eldest grandson?

1219
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,719
That's all hormones and it's not good.

1220
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,520
Come on, eat.

1221
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:38,159
They haven't sat down yet.

1222
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,120
Don't touch the chopsticks yet.

1223
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,239
It's fine.

1224
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,719
Ever since He Rui came back,

1225
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,920
it's been like this.

1226
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,159
My mom and grandma are chasing

1227
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,839
after He Rui every day to feed him.

1228
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,480
My dad just avoids them if he can.

1229
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,520
Yunjie's here.

1230
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,440
Hello.

1231
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,679
Sit down.

1232
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,239
Son.

1233
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,279
You eat first.

1234
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:54,960
Son,

1235
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:55,960
come over here.

1236
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:57,759
Stop arguing.

1237
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:58,920
You need to help us settle this.

1238
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,199
Help us settle this.

1239
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,359
Look at mom.

1240
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,080
Look at this.

1241
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,799
Can you stop arguing with mom?

1242
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,960
I've been busy all day.

1243
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:06,560
Now I have to mediate your arguments.

1244
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,719
Two people at home

1245
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,960
can't even take care of one child.

1246
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,159
Since He Rui came back,

1247
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,639
our home

1248
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,319
has been chaotic every day.

1249
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:21,080
Let's eat first.

1250
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,199
Ignore them for now.

1251
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,120
We've got a viewing later.

1252
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Is everything ready?

1253
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,040
It's ready.

1254
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,520
If I close a deal today,

1255
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,799
I'll treat everyone to a meal.

1256
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,359
Fei is so generous.

1257
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,600
Mr. Qian,

1258
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,120
I'd like to ask for your help.

1259
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,319
Of course.

1260
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,400
Let's talk over there.

1261
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,319
Mr. Qian,

1262
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,080
could you help me

1263
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,120
get some permissions? I need you

1264
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,520
to reserve a few apartments for me.

1265
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:00,880
Which ones do you need?

1266
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,520
Building 1,

1267
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:05,719
Building 6,

1268
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,000
Building 7, and Building 3.

1269
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,080
The ones you want are all prime locations.

1270
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Looks like you're picking up

1271
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,920
sales quickly.

1272
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:17,839
But if I reserve these

1273
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:18,560
for you,

1274
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,359
others might have an issue.

1275
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:21,719
I've been with the company

1276
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,600
for some time now.

1277
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,799
I think our sales team needs

1278
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,359
a bit of competition

1279
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:27,120
to motivate everyone.

1280
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
Now that I'm switching roles,

1281
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,199
I will definitely

1282
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,279
affect the earnings

1283
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,159
of the other salespeople.

1284
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,600
So I hope you can

1285
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,839
give me the maximum

1286
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,199
resource support.

1287
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:38,239
This way

1288
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:39,719
my performance will look great,

1289
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,600
and your profits

1290
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,839
will also be maximized.

1291
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:43,239
Wanzhen,

1292
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,600
you're good at negotiating.

1293
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,719
So, tell me,

1294
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,319
what's your plan?

1295
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,600
I want to hold a viewing event,

1296
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:51,520
to leverage my resources

1297
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,359
and turn them into performance.

1298
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,319
So, I need your full support.

1299
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:56,960
Sure.

1300
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,759
Just make sure it's well-organized here.

1301
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,239
Mr. Zhou,

1302
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,319
the usual?

1303
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:01,920
Yangchun noodles?

1304
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,560
Add a marinated egg for me today,

1305
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,359
and some luncheon meat.

1306
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:05,159
Got it.

1307
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,960
This way, please.

1308
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,920
Thank you.

1309
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,719
Please wait a moment.

1310
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,480
Your noodles will be ready soon.

1311
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,159
Okay.

1312
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,199
Please give me the noodles

1313
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,159
that the guest just ordered.

1314
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,239
Mr. Zhou.

1315
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,560
What a coincidence.

1316
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:21,600
You're here for dinner too?

1317
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,120
I came for a bowl of noodles.

1318
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,400
The Yangchun noodles here are delicious.

1319
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,120
You know it serves great noodles too?

1320
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:27,920
Come, have a seat.

1321
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,040
Sure.

1322
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,560
That was quick.

1323
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Sir, your noodles.

1324
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:37,920
Put it here.

1325
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,600
It's the noodles I ordered.

1326
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:43,759
Alright.

1327
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:47,560
The noodles I just ordered

1328
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
are the same kind.

1329
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,880
I ordered Yangchun noodles with extras.

1330
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,920
With a marinated egg and luncheon meat.

1331
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,159
I also ordered
