[EP16]

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Is Haowen really hurt?

4
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,800
Yes.

5
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:12,960
This morning, you know,

6
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,279
[when I got to his home,]

7
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,400
[I found that]

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,120
he was almost lying on the floor.

9
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,360
There was a big bump

10
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,800
on his head,

11
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,279
bruised and swollen,

12
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,520
and even some blood was coming out.

13
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,559
As a mother,

14
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,520
how could I not worry about it?

15
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,039
I just want to ask Xin

16
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,800
what's going on with them?

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,480
[Why did]

18
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,200
[they have a fight?]

19
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,400
[Mrs. Xu]

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,319
[I've seen that]

21
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,719
[your house is quiet]

22
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,640
[spacious.]

23
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,319
[Why not let Xin]

24
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,400
[stay with you for a while.]

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,480
I'll have the nanny

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,599
bring Xin's things

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,480
back here.

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,719
What's your opinion?

29
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,039
She's been in a bad mood these days,

30
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,200
which swings a lot.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
If they fight again,

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,999
I do feel hurt

33
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:56,200
if Haowen gets hurt.

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
If Xin gets hurt,

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,960
that would hurt

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,279
not just her,

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,039
it would hurt the baby, too.

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,999
The consequences

39
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,240
are unimaginable.

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,159
I think it's better to

41
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,319
have Xin stay with you

42
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,439
for as long as she wants.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,559
What do you think?

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,039
Mom.

45
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,039
Xin, you get up.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,999
I finally get to sleep in.

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
I heard you talking outside,

48
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,400
so I get up quickly.

49
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,879
I'm already an adult

50
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,839
and pregnant

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
with my second child.

52
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,360
How can't I decide

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
where I want to stay

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,319
and for how long?

55
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,439
Xin

56
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,879
You can decide

57
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,520
to stay wherever you want.

58
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,480
For a young couple,

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,719
it's normal to argue from time to time.

60
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,439
But why do you have to hit him?

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,640
When did I ever hit him?

62
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,240
I didn't hit him.

63
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,400
On Haowen's head,

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,999
there's such a big bump,

65
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,480
bruised and bleeding.

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
Wasn't that you?

67
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,200
I just don't understand.

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Way back in the day,

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,240
you two started from scratch.

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,920
Together, you

71
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,279
worked hard to build your business.

72
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,559
You've been through tough times.

73
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,439
But I never saw you fight.

74
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,920
Now that life is better,

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,439
and you are living in such a big house.

76
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,520
You have everything you want.

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,879
Why are you starting causing trouble?

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
You're not just making trouble,

79
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,559
you even hit Haowen.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,360
This is between

81
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,159
Jia Haowen and me.

82
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,759
Mom, please leave us alone, okay?

83
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,400
How can I do nothing?

84
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,039
When I entered the home,

85
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:24,879
I saw the home

86
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,840
was totally a mess.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,079
Xiongxiong told me

88
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,439
you two were getting divorced.

89
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,079
He's not even going to school.

90
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:32,999
Who told you that?

91
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,399
It's Jia Haowen, right?

92
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:34,959
He told you I made the home

93
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,199
into chaos

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
and I hit his head

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
and gave him a big

96
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:38,559
bleeding bump.

97
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,439
That's what he said, right?

98
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,360
Just ask him to come here

99
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:40,920
and clear this up

100
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,680
in front of me.

101
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,480
Did I really hit him?

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,079
Did I even touch him?

103
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,999
As a grown man,

104
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,240
he's still telling mommy on me.

105
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
He wants a divorce, right?

106
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,559
Okay!

107
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,240
Fine, then divorce.

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,639
You see,

109
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,920
look at Xin's temper.

110
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,800
Yes, yes.

111
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:54,879
Well.

112
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,519
She's pregnant, so her temper is bad.

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,879
Please

114
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,519
don't be angry.

115
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,840
That's just angry words.

116
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,559
They won't divorce, they won't.

117
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,959
Here, have some water.

118
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
Alright, alright.

119
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,079
Please, calm down.

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,600
Okay.

121
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Mrs. Jia

122
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,240
You hardly ever come here.

123
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
I thought about it.

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,559
We will not cook at home.

125
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,840
[Why don't we go out for a walk?]

126
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,840
Let's go eat outside.

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,120
Yes.

128
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,879
Let us hang out.

129
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,680
[Mrs. Jia]

130
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,999
[After we cross this bridge,]

131
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,480
[we'll show you that tower.]

132
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,040
See?

133
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,600
That tower.

134
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,040
It's said to be hundreds of years old.

135
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm telling you.

136
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,240
It's a real antique.

137
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,519
After that, we'll come back to

138
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,199
this street, it is full of restaurants.

139
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,079
You pick one.

140
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,519
They have Northeastern Chinese cuisine,

141
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,600
Shanghai cuisine,

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
and Cantonese cuisine.

143
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,480
It's said that this restaurant

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,840
is quite good.

145
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,999
We'll have

146
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:46,920
whatever you want.

147
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,240
Right.

148
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,920
But my family...

149
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,360
Haowen

150
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:49,920
Haowen

151
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,800
I see you.

152
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,199
[Over here.]

153
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,079
[Come over here.]

154
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:54,800
Go

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,120
Come here.

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,040
get a few boat tickets.

157
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,559
Over here.

158
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,439
Mom.

159
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:01,800
Dad.

160
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,199
What a nice surprise!

161
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,840
I can show you around if you want.

162
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,639
Put your hand down.

163
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,280
Put it down.

164
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm just scratching, Mom.

165
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,840
Scratching what?

166
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,079
You just put it down.

167
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,639
Mr. and

168
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,280
[Mrs. Xu]

169
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,999
[please look at this.]

170
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,879
[They just had a small fight]

171
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,439
[and he ended up being hit like this.]

172
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,199
Mom, who hit me?

173
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,680
I was getting something for Xin

174
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,439
from the top of the cabinet,

175
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,199
and a box fell down

176
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,199
and hit me.

177
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,240
Stop making things up.

178
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,840
Mom.

179
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,559
I got you boat tickets, let's go.

180
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,800
I'll be the guide.

181
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,720
Let's go.

182
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,759
What box? It's nonsense.

183
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,240
Mom, you...

184
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,999
Let's get on the boat.

185
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Let's go.

186
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,920
Here, you take this.

187
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,319
It's OK. I have money with me.

188
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,199
My mom's here,

189
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,879
and you may take the bill.

190
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,240
Haowen

191
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,879
Tell me the truth.

192
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,720
What really happened with your head?

193
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,199
It's an accident,

194
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
really an accident.

195
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Alright, Mom, look at me.

196
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,959
No matter what Mrs. Jia says,

197
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,999
just be nice to her.

198
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:13,600
Of course.

199
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,240
Don't forget it.

200
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,120
That's great, Mom.

201
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,879
Mom, look. How beautiful the scenery is.

202
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,600
Cheer up!

203
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,680
Dad, come here.

204
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,040
Mom.

205
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,879
Let me take a picture for you.

206
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,040
The scenery is really beautiful.

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,160
Come on.

208
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,079
One, two, three.

209
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,559
You can make a heart shape, Dad

210
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,079
and Mom.

211
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,600
Show me a heart, Mom.

212
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,120
Left hand.

213
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,120
Okay, show me a heart.

214
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,480
Haowen

215
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,399
Are we getting off the boat later?

216
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
Yes, Dad. It's so beautiful

217
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,160
that we should take a good look around.

218
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,600
Mrs. Xu

219
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,240
Mom

220
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,639
[Let me tell you...]

221
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,199
Mom

222
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:42,920
Look.

223
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
How beautiful the scenery is.

224
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,800
[Look at the mountains and rivers.]

225
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,559
[Come.]

226
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,879
[Let me take a picture for you.]

227
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,840
[Cheer up.]

228
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,280
[My wonderful mom.]

229
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Aren't you happy, Mom?

230
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,759
It's alright, Mom.

231
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,720
How nice this is.

232
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,280
Look at there,

233
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,480
[Mom.]

234
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,319
[We're having fun, please cheer up.]

235
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,040
[Don't keep a long face.]

236
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,959
Haowen

237
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,439
Don't look back.

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,240
Keep going.

239
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,280
[I noticed that you are more and more]

240
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,959
Look ahead.

241
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,720
[attentive to your in-laws.]

242
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,040
You keep calling them Dad

243
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,840
and Mom

244
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
so affectionately.

245
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,040
Do you ever notice me,

246
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,319
your real mom?

247
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,399
You keep saying "real mom" yourself.

248
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,519
Aren't we on the same side?

249
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,319
Don't look back.

250
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,680
[Are you jealous of this?]

251
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,759
[Do you really want me to]

252
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,439
call you "my real mom"

253
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,920
in front of my in-laws?

254
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,840
How ridiculous.

255
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,240
Now I finally understand

256
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,159
why you've spoiled Xin

257
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,279
to be like this.

258
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,879
When it comes to your in-laws,

259
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,799
you have no bottom line at all.

260
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,399
Mom, don't get involved in our matters.

261
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,360
We are doing fine on our own.

262
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,639
You'll only make it messier.

263
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,639
With Xin being like this,

264
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,720
how can you lead a happy life.

265
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,360
How can I not get involved?

266
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,600
How can I turn a blind eye to you?

267
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
Let me tell you.

268
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,919
I've found that your father-in-law

269
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,240
is a reasonable person.

270
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,999
Today,

271
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,600
I must have a good talk with him.

272
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,399
Alright, Mom.

273
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,240
Just stop meddling.

274
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,200
I can handle my own affairs.

275
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,679
I can manage, don't worry about it.

276
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,639
Dad, come on.

277
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,919
Let's take a picture.

278
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,360
Come.

279
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,279
Come.

280
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,519
Let's take a picture.

281
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,399
Okay, I'll take a picture for moms first.

282
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,080
Watch your back.

283
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,720
Alright.

284
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,480
Look at me.

285
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
Let me get the

286
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,799
plaque in the picture.

287
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,960
One, two, three.

288
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Dad, just join them.

289
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:25,360
Alright.

290
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,639
Come here.

291
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,399
Okay.

292
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,080
[There are more good dishes coming.]

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,039
Take your time eating.

294
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,759
There are also two new dishes today.

295
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,080
Dad, I've got everything arranged,

296
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,440
and you paid the bill.

297
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,840
My Dad is helping me save money.

298
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,200
Uh, Dad, Mom,

299
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
the company is pressing me.

300
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I have to go to a meeting.

301
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
The food is all arranged.

302
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,919
Just take your time.

303
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,600
Dad,

304
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,399
Mom,

305
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,279
my mom's temper

306
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,399
is so much better now.

307
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,679
Thank you for your patience.

308
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,840
[Mom,]

309
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
let's talk at home later.

310
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,720
Your temper is much better now, right?

311
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,320
I knew it.

312
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,679
I'm leaving.

313
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,320
Haowen

314
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,399
Does it hurt?

315
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,320
It's fine, Mom.

316
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,960
Haowen

317
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,600
Haowen

318
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,600
Take this with you.

319
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,360
Mom, look.

320
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,279
Dad really cares about me.

321
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,200
Mom,

322
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,879
I'm leaving now.

323
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,840
Take your time eating.

324
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,039
Be careful with your wound.

325
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,639
I'll be fine.

326
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,720
Mrs. Jia

327
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,600
Look.

328
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,799
This is the fish you love.

329
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
This is the beef you love.

330
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,960
This is the shrimp you love.

331
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
This is the chicken you love.

332
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,159
I'll get it for you.

333
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,279
Have some soup first.

334
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,440
Here you are.

335
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,320
Try it.

336
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,440
Try it.

337
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,519
Mr. and Mrs. Xu

338
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,720
I really didn't want to say this.

339
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,720
You prepared

340
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,799
such a sumptuous feast for me.

341
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,279
As in-laws of each other,

342
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,440
we should get along harmoniously.

343
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,600
I thought we can chat together.

344
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,519
I was planning to come here to take care

345
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,120
of Xin during her postpartum period.

346
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,120
When I walked in their house,

347
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
I saw a huge bump on my son's head

348
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,279
that was this big.

349
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,840
Mrs. Jia

350
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,320
It was this big.

351
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,799
This big.

352
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,200
You didn't see it earlier,

353
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,679
when I got home, it was this large,

354
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,200
both purple and red.

355
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
And it was oozing blood.

356
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
Xiongxiong also told me

357
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,919
that his parents are getting divorced.

358
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,639
[That can't be true.]

359
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,200
When I heard that,

360
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,039
I was over-anxious,

361
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,279
and my anger just rose up.

362
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,999
Mrs. Xu

363
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,960
We are women.

364
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,480
We should understand each other.

365
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,519
Haowen's father passed away early.

366
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,120
It's just my son and me.

367
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,240
We rely on each other.

368
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,480
It wasn't easy raising him.

369
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,120
Yes, right.

370
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,200
I never

371
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,919
laid a finger on him.

372
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,879
Haowen has turned out very well.

373
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,960
He's been so good, growing up like this.

374
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
And then he started

375
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,480
such a big company.

376
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,440
He brought Xin into the family.

377
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,799
Their marriage is perfect.

378
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,759
As a mother and mother-in-law,

379
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:30,320
I think

380
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,600
I've done my duty.

381
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,080
Every man cares about their pride,

382
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,720
right?

383
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
When he goes out

384
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
with a bump this big on his head,

385
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
how is that man supposed

386
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,679
to face people?

387
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,519
Besides,

388
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
I think their marriage

389
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,320
is very good.

390
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,799
Yes.

391
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,879
Haowen is so

392
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,120
devoted to Xin.

393
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:47,879
Yes, he is.

394
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,200
He gives her whatever she wants.

395
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,799
When she wanted a house, he bought it.

396
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,279
When she wanted a car, he bought it.

397
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
And she got her bags, too.

398
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,039
As for the expansion of your house,

399
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,960
Haowen also contributed to it,

400
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,879
right?

401
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,639
Yes.

402
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,279
He's been a great son-in-law

403
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,159
and a perfect husband.

404
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,639
What else can you ask from him?

405
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,720
We can always talk about any issues.

406
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,320
Why resort to violence, right?

407
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,399
As a mother,

408
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,919
it breaks my heart to see that.

409
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,679
Any couples

410
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,120
will have disagreements.

411
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,240
It's a normal part of life, right?

412
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Besides, she even asks for a divorce

413
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,879
while she is pregnant

414
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,120
with the second child.

415
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,759
If they do get divorced,

416
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,440
the baby will be born without a father.

417
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
What will she do then?

418
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,960
Am I right?

419
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,879
We can't let them

420
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,840
reach that point.

421
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,360
Of course no.

422
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,639
Rest assured, it won't happen.

423
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,999
Well.

424
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Mrs. Xu,

425
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
have you and Mr. Xu

426
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,720
ever argued before?

427
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,320
When you were arguing,

428
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,960
did you dare to hit him?

429
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:41,480
Yes.

430
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,320
If I hit you,

431
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,639
would you dare to hit back?

432
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,919
No.

433
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,200
Mrs. Jia

434
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,480
Please calm down.

435
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
Divorce is not something

436
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,720
that will happen in our family.

437
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,320
[Right.]

438
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,919
It's not our family tradition.

439
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,679
Don't worry about it.

440
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:18,919
You two

441
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,560
are reasonable people.

442
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,679
[That's why I'm here to ask you]

443
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,159
to prevent Xin

444
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,240
from taking this step.

445
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,799
Right?

446
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,919
She will never take that step.

447
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,840
Don't worry.

448
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,440
[Yes.]

449
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,919
[Mrs. Jia,]

450
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,039
[drink some soup, it's getting cold.]

451
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,279
[Don't worry.]

452
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,240
[Look,]

453
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
[the area of this apartment complex]

454
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,320
[is quite large.]

455
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,039
[The landscaping is wonderful.]

456
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,440
We just crossed this bridge

457
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,399
earlier.

458
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,879
This bridge, right?

459
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,519
Yes, that one.

460
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,879
How is it?

461
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,200
We've got plenty of video and photos.

462
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
The material is sufficient.

463
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,639
Great.

464
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,320
Director Sun

465
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,960
Director Sun

466
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,120
[How about]

467
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
our best sales manager?

468
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,200
How was the introduction?

469
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,519
She's so professional

470
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,720
that I almost wanted to buy it.

471
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,399
I just had them go on-site

472
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
to take some footage.

473
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,879
We have both photos and videos.

474
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,960
We will arrange them when we get back

475
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,480
and give you the plan as soon as possible.

476
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,799
Wanzhen is particularly excellent.

477
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,519
Thank you for recommending us

478
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,440
such a talented person.

479
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,240
I appreciate your insight.

480
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:16,799
Wanzhen,

481
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,200
accompany Ms. Xu for us.

482
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:18,879
Okay.

483
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,440
[You two can continue.]

484
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:19,840
[Okay.]

485
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,039
Alright.

486
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,759
Okay then.

487
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,360
I'll go back to work now.

488
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,639
Okay, you go about your work.

489
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,639
Keep it up!

490
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,879
[What do you say?]

491
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,840
[I didn't expect such great benefits.]

492
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,279
[You don't know.]

493
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,240
[When it's lunchtime]

494
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,159
[every day,]

495
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,240
I have to escape from the company.

496
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,200
The smell of takeout all over the office

497
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,279
makes me feel nauseous.

498
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,240
I just can't stand it.

499
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,039
If I had known you were coming,

500
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,080
I would have made more.

501
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,679
It is already enough.

502
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,519
Message.

503
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,679
[One, two, three.]

504
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,159
[Nice.]

505
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,600
[Good.]

506
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,519
They are having quite a good time.

507
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,879
So happy.

508
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,840
What's that?

509
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,919
A video from the nanny

510
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,639
with Wanzhen and Zhenzhen

511
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,639
playing in the park.

512
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,720
Did you hire a male nanny?

513
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
What male nanny?

514
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,960
It's sent by the female nanny.

515
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,919
[One, two, three.]

516
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,679
You still don't believe me?

517
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,960
Just look.

518
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:20,919
[Great!]

519
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,240
This young man looks quite good.

520
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,080
Who is he?

521
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
He's just a

522
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,440
neighbor.

523
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,200
You hesitated.

524
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,440
I...

525
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,519
Me and my neighbor have lived

526
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,840
across the hall for over ten years.

527
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,399
And we haven't been this close.

528
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Tell me the truth.

529
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:48,919
Who is he?

530
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
What are you thinking?

531
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,519
He's just Wanwan and Zhenzhen's

532
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,679
pediatrician.

533
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,879
He's currently

534
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,759
a very good friend of the kids.

535
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,080
He's closer to them than to me.

536
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
So you've got another doctor, too?

537
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,279
What do you mean?

538
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,159
He is your neighbor

539
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,840
and your kids' pediatrician.

540
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,159
I think this young man

541
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,720
has a clear plan, which may be

542
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,120
achieving his goals indirectly, isn't he?

543
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,120
Was he, from time to time,

544
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,239
delivering medicine to the kids

545
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,439
and showing you some kindness?

546
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,840
Just tell me yes or no.

547
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,840
No.

548
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:20,679
Really.

549
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,479
Stop talking nonsense like this.

550
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,360
It's really not going to happen.

551
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,879
He's not suitable for me.

552
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,239
Why isn't he suitable?

553
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,639
I think you two make a great couple.

554
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:30,280
You have a strong couple vibe.

555
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,159
You know, married women

556
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:33,520
love to indulge in these sweet fantasies.

557
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,199
Come on,

558
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:34,959
tell me more.

559
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,120
I'll help you analyze it.

560
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,719
I see that you don't mean to analyze

561
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:38,840
but to gossip.

562
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,159
Well, I actually do want

563
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,280
to help you analyze.

564
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:43,199
Look,

565
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,360
we are all adults.

566
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,520
We are all busy with

567
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,879
our own work.

568
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,040
There isn't much time

569
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,280
to help take care of someone else's kids.

570
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,879
Am I right?

571
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,239
It's not an obligation.

572
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,879
I think this young man is

573
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,239
definitely into you.

574
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,199
Right now,

575
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,879
I don't want to think about these things.

576
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,719
I just want to focus on my work,

577
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,479
making money and raising the kids.

578
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,959
Are you feeling insecure?

579
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,719
Wanzhen, you can't be like this.

580
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,239
Even though you're divorced

581
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,479
with two kids,

582
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,399
you can still

583
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:13,800
start a new chapter.

584
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,639
Many people find happiness

585
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,159
in their second marriage.

586
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,199
Don't be afraid, okay?

587
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,199
Are you going to eat or not?

588
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,360
If not, I'll take it away.

589
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,560
I do, I'll eat then.

590
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,080
How about asking him out someday

591
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,840
and we have a meal together?

592
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,959
I'll help you figure it out.

593
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,479
Okay.

594
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,239
Let's figure it out

595
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,360
and see if you need some help.

596
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,639
This young man

597
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,360
definitely wants something.

598
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,639
Don't doubt it, okay?

599
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Just eat your food.

600
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,959
Eating won't stop you talking.

601
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,719
I'm just having some fun.

602
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
You're really gossipy.

603
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,360
The HR Department's comprehensive

604
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,040
evaluation suggests Mu is the perfect man

605
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,399
for the Deputy Director position.

606
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,239
You see,

607
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,520
his educational background

608
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,600
and project experience

609
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,239
are qualified for the position.

610
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,239
Moreover,

611
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,719
he is someone

612
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,879
we have trained ourselves.

613
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
As a veteran of our Content Department,

614
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,760
promotion of him will

615
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,040
encourage more young people

616
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,479
and show them the advancement

617
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
opportunities in our company

618
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:21,800
are totally available.

619
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,040
What do you think, Mr. Zhang?

620
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,600
Mu is indeed competent,

621
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,399
but he might be too suitable.

622
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,360
Do you know

623
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,959
why I have been wanting to

624
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,600
hire someone from outside?

625
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,879
"A monk from outside reads sutras better."

626
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,399
This old saying truly

627
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:41,000
makes sense.

628
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,959
Our company

629
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,159
urgently needs to expand

630
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,479
some new business areas.

631
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,239
So we need to hire from outside

632
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:49,800
because they can

633
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,760
bring new resources

634
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,040
and fresh perspectives.

635
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
[This is something Xinmiao urgently needs.]

636
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,760
Let's start with external hiring.

637
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,719
If we really can't find anyone suitable,

638
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,800
we can promote from within.

639
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,959
Do you have any other matters?

640
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,840
No, nothing else.

641
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,439
Mr. Wu

642
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,000
[This plan]

643
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,080
[should be quite easy to execute, right?]

644
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,080
The plan is easy, but making money is not.

645
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:36,080
Mu,

646
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,760
take a break for now,

647
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,959
then let's have a meeting together

648
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,000
to finalize the plan.

649
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,879
We'll submit it to Mr. Zhang

650
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,520
before 5 o'clock.

651
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay.

652
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,840
Your expression is a bit serious.

653
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,360
Here's a new situation.

654
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,199
I just talked to Mr. Zhang

655
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:58,879
about Mu's promotion.

656
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,199
Guess what he said.

657
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,080
He doesn't want to promote Mu.

658
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,959
Did he tell you why?

659
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,679
He still wants to hire from outside,

660
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,959
find the person bringing new resources.

661
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,959
If that fails,

662
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
then we'll promote one from within.

663
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,600
Bringing up Mu's promotion with him

664
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,600
earlier was indeed a bit rash.

665
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,080
Anyway, I think

666
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,120
he is determined

667
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,199
to hire someone from outside.

668
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,280
If it really happens,

669
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,959
the person will be a big threat to you.

670
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,239
When do you plan to tell him

671
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,280
about your pregnancy?

672
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,439
I need to wait a bit longer.

673
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:36,919
I'm still in the first trimester.

674
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,239
What I want to tell you

675
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,280
is about this.

676
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:41,679
You absolutely cannot mention

677
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,639
your pregnancy right now.

678
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,439
He is a person

679
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:44,840
with a lot of thoughts and worries.

680
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,239
I'm afraid that if you tell him,

681
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,000
he'll overthink things even more.

682
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:55,399
Wanzhen

683
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:56,560
There's a dinner party tonight.

684
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
You'll come with me.

685
00:21:58,399 --> 00:21:58,959
Mr. Qian

686
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,520
You can take me with you.

687
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,600
I can even help you with the drinks.

688
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,439
Next time when there are

689
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,840
high-end clients, I'll take you.

690
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:05,520
Mr. Qian

691
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:06,879
Then can I skip this one?

692
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,199
Feifei can drink, let her handle it.

693
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:10,800
No, you have to go.

694
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,600
Director Xu

695
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,479
is your friend, isn't she?

696
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,479
Will she be there, too?

697
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,600
Yes, we'll have dinner and chat.

698
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,439
And you need to discuss with her

699
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,479
about the marketing plan

700
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,560
If you really can't make it,

701
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,639
I'll send Director Sun instead.

702
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,399
No, no, no.

703
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,280
I have to go.

704
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,919
I made this marketing plan,

705
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:23,879
so I must be there.

706
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,600
I'll go.

707
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,479
Great.

708
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,159
Then get ready.

709
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,600
Wanzhen

710
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,600
Can you drink?

711
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,639
You should be careful about

712
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,879
Mr. Qian's drinking capacity.

713
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,360
How is it going?

714
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,679
The project proposal is done.

715
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,959
I'm about to deliver it to you.

716
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,800
Here is the contract.

717
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,840
Perfect timing.

718
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,560
Then

719
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,760
let's go over it in the car.

720
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,399
We'd better sign the contract soon

721
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:59,080
to avoid any further complications.

722
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,679
Let's go now.

723
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
It's almost time to get off work.

724
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,159
You're working overtime today.

725
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I mean, the client is about to off duty.

726
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,840
Then you must hurry up.

727
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,159
What's wrong?

728
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,159
Side stitches.

729
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:18,399
It's okay. I'm fine.

730
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:19,280
Hold this.

731
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,080
Mr. Zhang

732
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,679
Aren't we here to sign the contract?

733
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,600
Who told you that the contract

734
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,520
can't be signed during a meal?

735
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,199
We'll also have some drink.

736
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,800
What?

737
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,280
What did you think I asked you for?

738
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:37,479
Mr. Zhang

739
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,600
Wanzhen

740
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,360
Don't bother with this.

741
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,239
Let the waitstaff handle it.

742
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,399
It's okay. It's part of my job.

743
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:47,679
Okay.

744
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:51,560
Mr. Qian

745
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,600
There they are.

746
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,040
Look.

747
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:56,080
[Sorry.]

748
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,479
[Mr. Zhang]

749
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,959
[There was a bit of traffic on the way.]

750
00:23:58,919 --> 00:23:59,600
You're just in time.

751
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,399
We just arrived as well.

752
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,520
This must be Director Xu.

753
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:03,760
Mr. Qian, nice to meet you.

754
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,520
I'm Xu Meng'an

755
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,439
I've heard so much about you.

756
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:05,959
Likewise.

757
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I've heard that

758
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,439
Director Xu is a

759
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:10,199
formidable woman when drinking.

760
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:11,439
Just empty praise.

761
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:11,919
Well, today

762
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:12,959
we'll definitely drink well.

763
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,679
[We're here to discuss about the contract.]

764
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,520
[After we drink well,]

765
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,360
we'll sign it right away.

766
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,199
Yes.

767
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,239
Come.

768
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:19,800
Please, sit down.

769
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,159
Wanzhen

770
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,159
What's going on?

771
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,080
Do we really have to drink?

772
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,879
Yes.

773
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:31,879
Definitely.

774
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,560
Come on.

775
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,479
Sit down.

776
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,520
Come over.

777
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,760
[Mr. Qian]

778
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:44,199
[Come on.]

779
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,399
Let's toast to a successful partnership.

780
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:47,199
Cheers, Mr. Zhang.

781
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,360
Director Xu hasn't drunk yet.

782
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:09,080
Drink it.

783
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,760
I think it's too easy.

784
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,280
Director Xu,

785
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,080
are you going to

786
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,000
drink the whole pot?

787
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:20,879
Yes.

788
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,800
Mr. Zhang,

789
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,800
today, for the contract,

790
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,959
I'm really giving it my all.

791
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:27,800
Mr. Qian,

792
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,280
today

793
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,800
I will drink until you're satisfied.

794
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:30,520
I'll drink until you're willing

795
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,479
to sign the contract with Mr. Zhang.

796
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:32,919
Alright.

797
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,600
Wanzhen

798
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,639
Get the spirits ready for me.

799
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:35,080
No problem.

800
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,520
I'll drink it all!

801
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,919
Good.

802
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:41,600
Director Xu

803
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,919
is indeed living up to her reputation.

804
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,080
[She is truly someone.]

805
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,239
[A female hero.]

806
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,879
[Gentlemen,]

807
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,719
[look, the lady is drinking like this,]

808
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:50,239
[we can't be left behind, right?]

809
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,280
[Let's have a drink, too.]

810
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,840
[Alright.]

811
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:52,439
[Alright.]

812
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:11,320
Mr. Qian,

813
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,120
the contract is here

814
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,000
and the pen is here.

815
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:16,159
I'll drink all of this.

816
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:17,840
Well, you... I...

817
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,840
See, she always rushes to do everything.

818
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,159
You see?

819
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,199
If I don't sign it today, I guess

820
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:25,360
I won't be able to get out of here.

821
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,760
Or I'll have one drink, too.

822
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,280
[Don't.]

823
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,840
I'll have one more.

824
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,399
No, that's enough.

825
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,040
I'll sign it.

826
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
I'll sign it right now.

827
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:30,760
That's enough.

828
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:31,679
[Sit down, please.]

829
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:32,639
[Please.]

830
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,600
Yunjie

831
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,840
Why aren't you leaving yet?

832
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,239
You go ahead.

833
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,120
Don't worry about me.

834
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,679
Okay.

835
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,000
You scared me to death.

836
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,199
Look at the clothes I bought today.

837
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,000
Aren't they nice?

838
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:56,919
Sure.

839
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,439
You're dressed up

840
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:00,239
with a dog collar around your neck.

841
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:00,959
What do you know?

842
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,360
[This is called a choker.]

843
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,679
[I don't know that.]

844
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:04,639
What shall we eat?

845
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,000
We can't get home too late.

846
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:06,840
Let's go.

847
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,879
It definitely won't be too late.

848
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:08,600
I'll take you there.

849
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,280
Take it slow.

850
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,399
Isn't it cool?

851
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,199
A little bit cool.

852
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,679
But their skill

853
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,080
is not so good.

854
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:49,520
I feel like

855
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
it's similar to the band we saw

856
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,560
at the music festival last time.

857
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,959
Far from it, okay?

858
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,000
Aren't they better looking?

859
00:27:58,199 --> 00:28:00,159
My dad is much better looking than them.

860
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,239
Besides,

861
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
I prefer

862
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,600
someone with real talent.

863
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,760
They are not playing as well as I do.

864
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,399
You're just boasting.

865
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,159
Ladies,

866
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,280
mind if we make friends?

867
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:52,120
[Look at what I bought.]

868
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:54,760
Here you are.

869
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,520
Have some milk tea.

870
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,919
Here.

871
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:57,479
Hand these to others.

872
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,080
Okay.

873
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,919
Thank you.

874
00:28:58,919 --> 00:28:59,760
Thank you.

875
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,560
Come on, bro.

876
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:00,919
Okay.

877
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,120
Here, Yunjie.

878
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:02,959
Here.

879
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,479
Thank you.

880
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,280
Here you are, bro.

881
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:05,239
Okay.

882
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,360
Here.

883
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,639
Yunjie

884
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:09,919
Together.

885
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:10,639
Together.

886
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,639
One, two, three, cheers for 
friendship.

887
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:13,479
Cheers.

888
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,479
Uncle,

889
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
here is an issue

890
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,280
that I need to report to you.

891
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,639
Dad,

892
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,159
about what I did today,

893
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,399
can we not tell Mom?

894
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,560
No.

895
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,600
We never hide anything from your mother.

896
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,199
It's a family rule.

897
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:37,600
Besides,

898
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,199
we've always told you

899
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,360
not to have food or drink

900
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,600
from strangers.

901
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,080
You're a middle school student now.

902
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,600
How could you forget this?

903
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,280
What if there's something bad

904
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,120
in the drink?

905
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,320
Right?

906
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,080
Luckily, Liu Siming

907
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,199
reported this to me in time.

908
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,719
Traitor.

909
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,080
Don't call Liu Siming

910
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,719
a traitor.

911
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:58,760
In this case,

912
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,879
Liu Siming did the right thing.

913
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,399
It's really worrying.

914
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:03,479
Today,

915
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,040
we really didn't do anything.

916
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,919
He Lu wanted to comfort me,

917
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,639
so she took me out to relax.

918
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,199
Comfort you about what?

919
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,800
She said

920
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,760
with the second child,

921
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,439
the first child is not favored anymore.

922
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,000
Why did you stop, Dad?

923
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,520
[You're back.]

924
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:42,280
Yeah, we're home.

925
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,280
Come back.

926
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,639
You just leave your shoes like this?

927
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
[I'm sorry.]

928
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:54,919
Meng'an hasn't come back yet.

929
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,360
She said she'll have dinner outside today

930
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,520
and won't come back for dinner.

931
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,800
How's it?

932
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:18,000
Are you okay?

933
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,080
I'm fine.

934
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,840
It's nothing much.

935
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Are you okay?

936
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,639
I'm definitely fine.

937
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:27,719
Just drank a lot of cold water.

938
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:30,600
If it wasn't you today,

939
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I'd definitely be in trouble.

940
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:34,439
You could have had some water, too.

941
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,320
That won't do.

942
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:36,280
One of us has to drink

943
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,040
the real stuff

944
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,320
so that they won't find out.

945
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,479
Besides,

946
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,639
I need to be positive

947
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:41,600
in front of my boss.

948
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,879
Do you really need that?

949
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,199
You must have known I was coming,

950
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,639
so you came to help me with the drinking.

951
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,120
I can only

952
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,639
help you with these

953
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,320
things within

954
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,239
my capability.

955
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,760
But this can't go on.

956
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Today I am the client,

957
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,239
what about tomorrow,

958
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:04,760
day after tomorrow,

959
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,600
and the day after that?

960
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,800
Unless you take me with you

961
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,719
every time you drink.

962
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:10,040
Will you come?

963
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,919
Of course, I will.

964
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,199
I'd definitely be willing to.

965
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,760
But what if

966
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,199
I have a business trip someday?

967
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,840
What about that?

968
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,439
This pregnancy issue

969
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,679
can't be hidden for too long.

970
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,919
You need to think carefully

971
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,840
about what to do next.

972
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:51,919
[You're back.]

973
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:53,080
[You must be tired.]

974
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,080
Did you drink?

975
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,600
How dare you drink?

976
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,159
Just kidding.

977
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,000
Wanzhen helped me out.

978
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,040
Then what about the smelling?

979
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,280
She kept giving me

980
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,040
a towel soaked in alcohol,

981
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,600
so I had to keep wiping it on me.

982
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,399
That's just going all out with the act.

983
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,080
I'm impressed by you guys.

984
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,000
You're back.

985
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,879
Ms. Li

986
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,919
The kids are sleeping?

987
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,760
Yes.

988
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,040
Sorry about

989
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,280
making you wait so late.

990
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,679
It's not easy to take care of

991
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,679
the kids all by yourself.

992
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,479
By the way,

993
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,399
the kids

994
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,919
did their homework with Dr. Yu

995
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,000
from upstairs today.

996
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:44,639
Did Dr. Yu come over today?

997
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,719
Wanwan and Zhenzhen

998
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,840
ran into him downstairs

999
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,719
and wouldn't let him leave.

1000
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,719
They played ball with him for a while

1001
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,320
and asked him to come over to do homework.

1002
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,360
Dr. Yu is really nice.

1003
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,239
Yes, he's very caring.

1004
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:56,560
I'm leaving now.

1005
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:57,080
Okay.

1006
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,000
Be careful on the way.

1007
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,600
Goodbye.

1008
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,400
The child is asleep, don't go in.

1009
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,239
You'll wake her up.

1010
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,520
It won't help.

1011
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,920
She'll find you annoying.

1012
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,199
But,

1013
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,279
how did you talk to her?

1014
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,040
I've talked it over.

1015
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:31,440
I've explained

1016
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,120
the seriousness of the situation.

1017
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:33,960
She understood.

1018
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,480
She also made a commitment

1019
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,480
that she won't drink

1020
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,639
strangers' drinks in the future.

1021
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:39,520
Isn't that good?

1022
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,560
What else can you do?

1023
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,080
What do you think is up

1024
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,319
with Yunjie lately?

1025
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,480
Why is she always

1026
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,560
hanging out with boys?

1027
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,520
Is it because the lack of fatherly love?

1028
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,359
Why is this on me?

1029
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,759
I'm also angry about it.

1030
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
It's those little brats

1031
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,239
who are interested in my daughter.

1032
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,880
Each one of them

1033
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,920
is ugly as can be.

1034
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:05,199
They're even worse than Liu Siming.

1035
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,359
Liu Siming isn't good enough, either.

1036
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,520
Right, he isn't good, either.

1037
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:13,719
Maybe

1038
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,960
it's just the restlessness of puberty.

1039
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,440
Then it's even more urgent to talk.

1040
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,239
I need to go talk to her.

1041
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:22,120
What's your rush?

1042
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,679
Take it easy.

1043
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,040
Puberty involves not just restlessness

1044
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,199
but also rebellion.

1045
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,600
Don't provoke her.

1046
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,920
The more you provoke her,

1047
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,199
the more she will go against you.

1048
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,679
You need to go with the flow.

1049
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,520
Right?

1050
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,799
Do you know

1051
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,400
what she told me today?

1052
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,159
What did she say?

1053
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,359
She said

1054
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,600
that He Lu took her out

1055
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,080
to comfort her.

1056
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,480
She also said

1057
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,520
from now on

1058
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,880
they're in the same boat.

1059
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:47,080
With the second child coming,

1060
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,639
the first child will no longer be favored.

1061
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,960
Now you are pregnant.

1062
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,639
How do you talk to her

1063
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,319
and in what stand?

1064
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,480
Have you thought about it?

1065
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,520
In the future,

1066
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,279
we need to pay more attention to Yunjie.

1067
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,679
Do not let her feel

1068
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,239
left out.

1069
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,440
So you mean to ignore it?

1070
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,319
No.

1071
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,560
Just be mindful.

1072
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,719
How?

1073
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,040
Be careful with your words.

1074
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,239
It's about putting yourself in her shoes.

1075
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Aren't you the eldest child in the family?

1076
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,560
Yes.

1077
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,880
After Xin was born,

1078
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,080
did you feel

1079
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,199
a sense of neglect?

1080
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:25,359
Absolutely.

1081
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,159
Yes.

1082
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,080
My parents spoiled Xin

1083
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,440
in all respects.

1084
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:31,839
But I think I'm fine.

1085
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,000
I've gotten over it, haven't I?

1086
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,480
I think my physical and mental states

1087
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
are much healthier than Xin's.

1088
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,319
That's you.

1089
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,120
How many people in the world are like you

1090
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,600
who are so mentally strong?

1091
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,560
Anyway,

1092
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:45,520
we must be

1093
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,440
fair and equal.

1094
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,440
It can't be.

1095
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,239
Why not?

11096
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,799
You're not one of us, you wouldn't know.

1097
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:51,799
Let me tell you,

1098
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:52,279
from now on, as long as

1099
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:53,560
you point out any issues she has,

1100
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,279
she'll feel

1101
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,480
it's because of the second child.

1102
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,359
So,

1103
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:57,920
it's not what you think.

1104
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
We must discipline her when it's needed.

1105
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Don't worry too much

1106
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,159
about her feelings.

1107
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,759
Especially you, you know?

1108
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:05,920
Don't always make excuses for her.

1109
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
You're such a tough mom.

1110
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,639
You're the one who's too soft.

1111
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:14,520
There's one more thing.

1112
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,520
Help me think about this.

1113
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,600
About the pregnancy,

1114
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,159
it probably can't be hidden anymore.

1115
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,520
How should I tell Mr. Zhang?

1116
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,679
Say it as it is.

1117
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
There's nothing to hide.

1118
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,960
Just one child

1119
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,600
has already made us

1120
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,799
exhausted.

1121
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,639
Why do we have to go through

1122
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,839
this again by having the second one?

1123
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:35,279
Let's take it easy.

1124
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,759
Wouldn't it be better to live longer?

1125
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,440
No.

1126
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:45,920
It's better to have more kids in home.

1127
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,159
Right?

1128
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,759
Let's get to wash and sleep.

1129
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,400
Still, I regret a bit.

1130
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,679
I do not know why.

1131
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,759
Listen to me, Xin,

1132
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:05,880
Dad has talked for a long time.

1133
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:09,080
It doesn't matter who is right or wrong.

1134
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,719
As the younger generation,

1135
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:12,199
you should

1136
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,319
apologize to the elders.

1137
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:15,239
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1138
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,520
Didn't I just say

1139
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,839
that I had not hit Haowen?

1140
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,880
I didn't do it, why do I have to apologize?

1141
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,560
Xin,

1142
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,639
why do you always get caught up in this?

1143
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,480
It doesn't matter

1144
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,600
whether you hit him or not,

1145
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,679
or if it was an accident,

1146
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,040
or if he bumped into something.

1147
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,880
So I must apologize no matter what.

1148
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,639
As a daughter-in-law, you should

1149
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,920
show some respect to your mother-in-law.

1150
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,799
It is not a big deal?

1151
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,199
Respect her?

1152
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,239
Yet she came all the way here

1153
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,920
to accuse me.

1154
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,319
She said that I'm lazy

1155
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,839
and troublesome,

1156
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,120
and that I'm never satisfied.

1157
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,239
But I didn't argue with her.

1158
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,080
With my temper,

1159
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,960
I didn't even argue with her.

1160
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,719
I said, "Mom,

1161
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,159
this is between me and Haowen.

1162
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,159
It's our personal issue.

1163
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:51,960
Can you please stay out of it?"

1164
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,400
She said no.

1165
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,040
She kept pushing and pushing.

1166
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,960
It aroused my anger.

1167
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,120
And it couldn't be taken back.

1168
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:57,759
Yes.

1169
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,880
I think it's her mother who's wrong.

1170
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,759
She didn't investigate thoroughly.

1171
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:02,440
How could she

1172
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,319
blame my daughter?

1173
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:03,639
Exactly.

1174
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,000
Right?

1175
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,440
Exactly.

1176
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,480
This is completely wrong.

1177
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,359
But don't forget,

1178
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:10,839
Haowen

1179
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,080
lost his father when he was young.

1180
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:14,759
It was his Mom

1181
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:16,279
who raised him on her own.

1182
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,839
His mother had a tough time.

1183
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,279
But I've been good to her, too.

1184
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm not saying you've been bad to her.

1185
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
She can stay as long as she wants.

1186
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,679
She can live in the big villa.

1187
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
She can see her grandson

1188
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,440
whenever she wants.

1189
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,440
We can even send him to her.

1190
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,279
She can watch him here as well.

1191
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:28,520
Haven't I been nice enough?

1192
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,159
Sometimes,

1193
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,520
why are you willing to apologize

1194
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,239
to your Mom after she gets angry

1195
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,359
even if it's your mother's fault?

1196
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:37,279
But that's my real Mom.

1197
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,880
Can she and my mother-in-law be the same?

1198
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,159
Why can't they be the same?

1199
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,480
Since you got married,

1200
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,440
I've treated Li Lin

1201
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,239
and Haowen

1202
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,520
as if they were my own sons.

1203
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,120
Yes,

1204
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:46,920
I know.

1205
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,639
It's natural for Haowen to spoil me.

1206
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,239
As a couple,

1207
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,239
we live our life

1208
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,359
and have marital issues,

1209
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,600
isn't that normal?

1210
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,000
Why make a big deal about it?

1211
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,040
What do you mean by saying that

1212
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,719
it's natural for him to spoil you?

1213
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,400
As a daughter-in-law,

1214
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,520
can't you be more forgiving

1215
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,679
and considerate towards your husband?

1216
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,639
Think about it honestly.

1217
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:00,960
Is it really you

1218
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,920
who's making trouble, or is it Haowen?

1219
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,839
Isn't it always you

1220
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,600
who comes back making a fuss?

1221
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,480
Isn't it my right?

1222
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,239
The next day,

1223
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:06,920
did he come to pick you up?

1224
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,520
[Why should I act up?]

1225
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,480
[Was it because of you?]

1226
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,319
[Isn't it because you spoiled me?]

1227
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,520
You've spoiled me until I'm thirty-four.

1228
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,239
Now you won't let me act up?

1229
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,040
Does that make sense?

1230
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,960
Then if you want Haowen to spoil you,

1231
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,040
he needs some time.

1232
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,279
I've spoiled you for decades.

1233
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,199
You've got married for only one decade.

1234
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:17,960
Yes, one decade.

1235
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,920
I've given birth to two children.

1236
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,960
Shouldn't he continue to spoil me?

1237
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,359
If he doesn't spoil me,

1238
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:21,279
I wouldn't have this second child.

1239
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:21,880
[What's the problem?]

1240
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:23,880
Am I right?

1241
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,600
Well, you...

1242
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,880
You can't say that just because

1243
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,480
you're having the second child,

1244
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,239
so no one can talk sense to you.

1245
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,759
Who's being unreasonable?

1246
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,520
I've done so much for

1247
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:34,960
his family.

1248
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,480
Haven't I contributed enough?

1249
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,719
Haven't I sacrificed enough?

1250
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,359
I raised Xiongxiong until he is seven.

1251
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,920
I couldn't do anything at home.

1252
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,520
I'm a designer, Dad.

1253
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,080
I have dreams, too.

1254
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:44,799
[The brand Dream Heart]

1255
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:45,839
[I created with Haowen]

1256
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,279
[was named after me.]

11257
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,359
Now I've been staying home every day

1258
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,880
to raise the kids. Is it easy for me?

1259
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,480
Finally, Xiongxiong is seven.

1260
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,520
I wanted to start working again.

1261
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,359
And now one more baby is on the way.

1262
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:55,679
Alright.

1263
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,359
Alright.

1264
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:57,480
[I understand]

1265
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,319
[what you just said.]

1266
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,960
[But let's put it this way,]

1267
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,040
Haowen spends his whole day

1268
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,920
managing a big business.

1269
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,839
He might drink outside,

1270
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:05,679
getting drunk.

1271
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,440
Which man wants to

1272
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,520
get drunk outside?

1273
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
Which man wants to

1274
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,040
please others outside?

1275
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,239
With a wife and children to raise,

1276
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,759
doesn't he have to go out

1277
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:12,759
and work hard to earn money?

1278
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:14,040
[And he gives all the money to you,]

1279
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,560
[so you can live]

1280
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,440
[the way you do now.]

1281
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,120
Shouldn't he earn money?

1282
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,400
[Why is it always]

1283
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,279
[about you and your needs?]

1284
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,560
[Shouldn't he give me the money?]

1285
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,719
He started from scratch.

1286
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,839
When I was with him,

1287
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:21,839
he had nothing.

1288
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,319
So how did you get to where you are today?

1289
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,120
I worked hard with him and earned it.

1290
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,440
Exactly.

1291
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,600
Stop talking about you and your needs.

1292
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,920
I've been talking to you for so long,

1293
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,880
but you're not listening.

1294
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,120
What's wrong with you?

1295
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,880
Apologize.

1296
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,639
I didn't do anything wrong.

1297
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,759
Why should I apologize?

1298
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:34,880
Whatever you say is wrong.

1299
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,719
Let me tell you,

1300
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,639
today

1301
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,839
when I got home,

1302
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,520
I just wanted some peace and quiet.

1303
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,159
But his mother came and we had a fight.

1304
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,359
It's the issues between me and my husband,

1305
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:43,520
I never mentioned divorce.

1306
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,880
You're so troublesome.

1307
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,080
How am I being troublesome?

1308
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,040
His mother said it,

1309
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,239
and you said it, too.

1310
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,120
I can't stay in this home anymore.

1311
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,719
I'll pack my things now.

1312
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:51,719
Don't be my father.

1313
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,279
Be Haowen's father instead.

1314
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,239
Mom.

1315
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,520
Coming.

1316
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:19,120
Mom.

1317
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,880
Haowen is here.

1318
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,120
I've been busy all along.

1319
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,319
I'm now picking up Xin.

1320
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,040
Your dad is scolding her.

1321
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,440
It's all my mom's fault, saying nonsense.

1322
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:28,920
Mom,

1323
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,000
I apologize for my mother's temper.

1324
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,319
We were handling things well.

1325
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,799
If she didn't interfere,

1326
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:34,239
we would be fine.

1327
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,480
I apologize on her behalf.

1328
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:38,040
Xin is pregnant now,

1329
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,880
and her temper is bad.

1330
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
Please don't take it to heart.

1331
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:41,960
How can I?

1332
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,920
I understand Xin well.

1333
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,560
Xu Guanghua, I'm telling you...

1334
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,880
Dad.

1335
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,000
[Dad!]

1336
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,480
Hurry!

1337
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
What's going on?

1338
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,279
Phone, Meng'an.

1339
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,639
It's Mengxin.

1340
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,199
What does she want now?

1341
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,719
Hello.

1342
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,679
What's wrong in the middle of the night?

1343
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,319
[Meng'an]

1344
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:17,600
[Dad has passed out.]

1345
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:19,120
[You need to come quickly, Meng'an.]

1346
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
Dad has passed out?

1347
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:21,960
What happened?
