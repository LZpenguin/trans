Grandma!

Mom!

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,199
Grandma!

6
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,040
How's my Dad?

7
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,320
How is he?

8
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,760
He was fine when at table.

9
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,320
Then,

10
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,079
then I pissed him off.

11
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
And he, he...

12
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,999
he suddenly fainted.

13
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,400
Why did you provoke him?

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,520
[I didn't mean to do it.]

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,079
I...

16
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,479
I just contradicted him...

17
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,079
Don't blame her.

18
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,760
It's all my fault.

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,960
Your Dad had a headache this afternoon.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,120
And his blood pressure raised.

21
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,879
At that time,

22
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,159
I should have brought him to the hospital.

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,520
It's all my fault.

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,159
All right, all right.

25
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,879
Calm down.

26
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,800
Dad is under emergency treatment.

27
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:27,999
Mom,

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,200
don't worry.

attack is the golden time.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,439
Dad was sent to the operating room

33
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,559
within one hour already.

34
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,200
We shall believe in science

35

and trust the doctor.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,159
So relax, everyone.

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,999
I didn't mean to upset him.

38
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,439
I didn't expect this.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,200
It's all my fault.

40
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,319
All right, all right.

41

And she is just newly pregnant.

58

Trust me and the brother-in-law.

00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,800

Sister, sister.

68
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,080
Before you came, Xin

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,719
kept mumbling over and over that

70
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,680
she should be responsible for this.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,559
What's going on on earth?

72
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,319
Nothing serious.

73
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,480
You tell me carefully.

74
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,159
Well, my Mom visited us, right?

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,319
She saw this

76
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,879
caused by Xin.

77
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,159
She didn't like it.

78
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,120
So she complained to Mom and Dad.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
Dad heard her words,

80
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,759
and criticized Xin, then...

81
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,680
Xin hurt you?

82
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,960
She didn't mean it, sister.

83
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
She was at her will every time.

84
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,360
Sister.

85
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,120
What did she say?

86
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,800
Sister, Xin won't disclose anything bad.

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,680
They did not mean to provoke Dad.

88
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,360
Blame me if you want to.

89
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,120
I am the culprit.

90
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,959
Really, it is really...

91
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,920
Why do I blame you?

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,559
You got anything to do with it?

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
You want to take responsibility for her?

94
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,920
I tell you.

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
If Dad is okay, that's fine.

96
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,079
If anything happens, as his children,

97

all of us are accountable!

98
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
Now you try to cover for her?

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,959
Isn't it too late?

100
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,920
When you spoiled her,

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,319
you never

102
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,399
considered the consequences today?

103
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,600
You are perfectly right, sister.

104
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,480
Yes, it's all my fault!

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,999
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,959
If you are sorry, please stop

107
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,360
buzzing around me now.

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Go away.

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
Don't be angry.

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,680
What I said

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,879
is rational, isn't it?

112
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,079
Totally.

113
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,160
But now

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,680
it not the proper time for argument.

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Take a seat.

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,280
I can't sit down!

117
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,160
Just take a seat.

118
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,999
I don't want to sit with them.

119

All is well.

What did the doctor say?

147
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,439
The doctor said that it is normal

148
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,639
to get transferred to the ICU.

149
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,040
It is a process of monitoring

150
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,959
patient after the surgery.

151
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,959
Dad will recover

152
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,920
progressively in the future.

153
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,360
Wait,

154
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,079
he...

155
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,319
he is in the ICU.

156
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,600
It's a normal procedure?

157
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,999
Look at your Dad.

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,840
He has many tubes inserted into his body.

159
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,999
In his lifetime,

160
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:24,959
he never

161
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,879
had so many tubes inserted!

162
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,959
Mom, Mom, look.

163
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,360
Those tubes

164
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
are connected to

165
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
the monitoring devices.

166
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,120
They are for data collection.

167

No worry.

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,360
Why is it closed?

170

Mom, it's okay.

171
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,720
Please leave and go home.

172

No visits allowed

173

I don't want to go back.

177

I want to stay here with Dad.

178
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,120
[Xin,]

179
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,280
the doctor told us to leave.

180
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,040
And you are expecting.

181
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,999
I am not going back.

182
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,280
You go back.

183
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,720
Why are you staring at me?

184
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,759
My words don't count anymore?

185
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,519
Mom is also here.

186
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,759
She has been up all night.

187
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,199
She is also tired.

188
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,559
You send her back.

189
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,759
Settle her down.

190
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,759
Can I trust you?

191
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,559
Sure.

192
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,600
Mom,

193
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,840
Mom, let's go.

194
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,439
[Yunjie,]

195
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,879
You go back to grandma's home together.

196
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:26,559
Okay.

197
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,639
You need to go to school tomorrow.

198
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:29,480
Let's go, Mom.

199
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,160
We go together.

200
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,639
Go, go, go.

201
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,600
You go back with Mom.

202
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,639
We'll come to pick you up

203
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,720
early tomorrow morning.

204
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,559
Okay, let's go

205
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:34,920
Okay.

206
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,399
Go.

207
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:37,759
Take care of your aunt and grandmother.

208
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:38,999
Sister, take care.

209
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,639
I'll come early tomorrow.

210
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,039
Okay, okay.

211
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,039
Be careful on your way back!

212
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,840
[Don't worry.]

213
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,120
For Dad's situation, the recovery

214
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
will not be achieved in a short time.

215
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,720
Doctors are all like this.

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,879
They always tell

217
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,080
the worst case of

218
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,840
the patient to the families.

219
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,879
So don't worry too much.

220
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,720
I need to go to the toilet.

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,879
Okay.

222
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,560
Meng'an,

223
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,919
Meng'an,

224
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,120
You are awake.

225
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,480
What's wrong with me?

226
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,080
You fainted.

227
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,679
The doctor said that

228
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,360
it is because of the stress.

229
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,679
You are a little emotional.

230
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,399
My child,

231
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,960
can we still keep it?

232
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
There is still possibility.

233
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
Darling,

234
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,960
it is just because of Dad.

235
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
He is sick.

236
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,039
And you are stressed out.

237
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,720
But now we must

238
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,200
take care of ourselves.

239
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,279
You must take care of yourself.

240
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,240
So that we can

241
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,399
take good care of the Dad.

242
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,159
Right?

243
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,600
Do you agree?

244
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,799
Don't worry about it.

245
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,360
But I'm just an ordinary person.

246
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,759
I do not have grand ambitions.

247
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,679
I just want to have this baby.

248
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,399
I just want a happy family,

249
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,480
success in work,

250
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,919
and good health.

251
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,999
Why is it so difficult?

252
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,639
I understand now that

253
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,879
why everyone sends greetings

254
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,480
in the festivals

255
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,560
saying

256
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,399
"wish you good health,

257
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,200
and everything goes well."

258
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,480
They are not easy goals!

259
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,919
Don't think like that.

260
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:51,879
Don't think like that.

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
Give me a hug, honey.

262
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,360
I am here for you.

263
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,600
I am here for you.

264
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,240
[Where is]

265
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,120
my sister?

266
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
She's a little tired.

267
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,240
I asked her to rest

268
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,120
in the lounge.

269
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,360
Yes, yes. She's pregnant.

270
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
You two go back.

271
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,279
Me and Xin will stay here.

272
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,679
OK.

273
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,480
Then, we go back now.

274
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't worry.

275
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,360
If there's anything, call me.

276
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,159
Rest assured. Brother-in-law.

277
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,279
Okay, come on. Let me walk you out.

278
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,320
Xin, look.

279
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,399
How nice to have siblings.

280
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,159
Sister and brother-in-law left.

281
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,399
We can take turns.

282
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,480
Take a seat, Xin.

283
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,120
You didn't get much rest last night.

284
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,440
I just stand here.

285
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,200
Don't blame me for what I said.

286
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,960
Siblings are necessary.

287
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,480
When we are old,

288
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
if anything happens,

289
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
they can discuss and support each other.

290
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,200
Is that so?

291
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,279
Dad was fine.

292
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,600
It's all my fault

293
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,799
Don't worry, Xin.

294
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,799
Dad is gonna be fine.

295
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,519
Where are we going?

296
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,519
Back home.

297
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,639
Get changed.

298
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,759
Go to work.

299
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,399
You are going to work?

300
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,519
There are some works

301
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,279
needs to be arranged.

302
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,080
The baby...

303
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,560
I don't want it.

304
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,759
You heard what

305
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,360
the doctor said.

306
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,960
It's hard for Dad to recover as before.

307
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,919
Xin is having a second child.

308
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,679
I am the elder sister.

309
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,560
This family

310
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,360
is counting on me.

311
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,759
I've thought it through.

312
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,399
Let Lanxiang

313
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,679
live with Mom and Dad.

314
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,120
In the future, you shall

315
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
take care of the schooling of Yunjie.

316
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,200
I take care of Dad.

317
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,960
You should take care of yourself first.

318
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,399
As for Dad,

319
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,199
leave it to me.

320
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,120
We are having the regular meeting today.

321
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,080
Where are you?

322
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,679
Everyone is waiting for you.

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,040
[Sorry I'm late.]

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,719
It's okay. It's all right.

325
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,679
Why are you late?

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's not your style.

327
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,520
Something happened at home.

328
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,719
Sorry.

329
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,439
Your department

330
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,040
needs a deputy director.

331
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:08,520
Mr. Zhou recommended one.

332
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,000
Think about it carefully.

333
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,000
[Well, Director Xu.]

334
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,520
[Ling Meichuan is the deputy director]

335
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,600
[of the marketing department.]

336
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,760
She joined us three years ago.

337
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,919
In the marketing department

338
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,479
she works with content department

339
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,479
all the way for liaison.

340
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,959
[She is relatively familiar with]

341
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,199
[the work at the content department.]

342
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:29,199
[So]

343
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,600
[she wants to transfer to]

344
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,560
[your department.]

345
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,639
Practice and learn.

346
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,840
What's your opinion, Director Xu?

347
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,199
Is that okay?

348
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:37,760
Why not?

349
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,439
Are you okay?

350
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,520
You look so pale.

351
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:10,080
My father had a stroke last night.

352
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,080
I am having an unstable fetal position.

353
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,679
Before I came here, I got an IV drip.

354
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:15,959
What?

355
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,399
Then why did you come to work?

356
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,719
Arrange your works

357
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,800
at hand quickly.

358
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Hurry up. Go home.

359
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,479
Just say you are out

360
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,679
to meet the client.

361
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,639
Wait,

362
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,320
later, I will

363
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,879
prepare two sick notes for you.

364
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,360
If Mr. Zhang doesn't ask,

365
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,159
I won't put them in record.

366
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,000
If he asks about it,

367
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,280
I'll tell him you are on a sick leave.

368
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,080
Hurry up and go home.

369
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,639
Take a good care of your body.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,879
When you feel better,

371
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:38,919
you can return.

372
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,600
Our health is the most important.

373
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,840
Are you kidding me?

374
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,600
Thank you, Rachel.

375
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:45,679
No big deal.

376
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,719
The matter of Ling Meichuan,

377
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,800
you don't need to worry about it.

378
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,639
She has relations with shareholders.

379
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,239
For you, she is a just passenger.

380
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,360
She is destined to be the vice president.

381
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,120
Then Mu

382
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,800
has really no chance?

383
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, for Mu,

384
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,600
I can apply to raise his salary.

385
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,399
But the promotion,

386
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,399
we'll talk about it later.

387
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,040
How's your Dad now?

388
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,679
He hasn't woken up yet.

389
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,120
What can I say?

390
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,159
I feel sad for you.

391
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,719
[Our course is mainly...]

392
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,080
Hello,

393
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,000
the class is not over yet.

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,159
Can you leave later?

395
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,320
Wait for me, okay?

396
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,199
Okay, it's fine.

398
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,320
Mom's call.

399
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,120
Wanwan,

400
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,639
have you finished your homework?

401
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:16,719
Yes.

402
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:17,679
Mom,

403
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,879
I want to watch cartoons.

404
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Don't you want to go downstairs

405
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,280
to get stretched?

406
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Or play frisbee?

407
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,280
You should rest your eyes.

408
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,320
Yes!

409
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,360
Dear,

410
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,199
please take them downstairs

411
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,520
and take some activities.

412
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,479
Don't go too far. Just downstairs.

413
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:32,000
Okay.

414
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,479
Good.

415
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:34,800
Let's go.

416
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Go!

417
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,000
Your mother doesn't want a second child.

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,159
That's a good thing!

419
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,360
So you can enjoy the love

420
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,320
of Mom and Dad alone.

421
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,800
How nice!

422
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,000
Not like me.

423
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:04,840
The love of my parents

424
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
has been divided into two pieces.

425
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,560
My little brother takes the bigger one.

426
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,760
But I want to persuade my mother

427
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,959
to keep this child.

428
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,439
Why?

429
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:14,560
Are you fool?

430
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,120
You'll regret sooner or later.

431
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,479
Look at me.

432
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,959
I already told you.

433
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:20,879
Believe it or not.

434
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,320
I've thought about

435
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,600
what you said too.

436
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,479
But I think

437
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,919
the love of parents is not a pizza.

438
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,360
Can it be split that easily?

439
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,679
But their love is that much.

440
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,199
Children are troublesome.

441
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,600
When the baby is born,

442
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,399
he needs to be cared of inside out,

443
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,199
occupying all the attention of parents.

444
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,439
No attention to you anymore.

445
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,879
Actually, now I feel

446
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:44,159
complicated in heart.

447
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:45,959
My parents hid it from me before

448
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,760
about the second child.

449
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,000
I was quite upset.

450
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,879
But,

451
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
my mother suddenly told me that

452
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,719
she doesn't want Little Grape.

453
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,439
I'm quite disappointed.

454
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,679
What is Little Grape?

455
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,399
Little Grape is

456
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,360
the name I give it.

457
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:58,959
Stop.

458
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,800
Don't give it a name.

459
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,719
Once you do,

460
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,719
you get attachment.

461
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:06,679
My Mom said my grandpa is sick.

462
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:07,639
She has to take care of him.

463
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,399
So she may not want

464
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,000
Little Grape anymore.

465
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:14,840
No way.

466
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,439
I have to persuade her.

467
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:17,800
For what?

468
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,239
I just spoke to you so much.

469
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,159
All in vain!

470
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,719
I can't be against my conscience, right?

471
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,959
I figure it out now.

472
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:23,959
I just want my Mom

473
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,879
to give birth to Little Grape.

474
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:25,919
If I don't persuade her,

475
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,840
I will regret it in the future.

476
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,959
You forget your backpack!

477
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:31,479
Leave it to you!

478
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:34,080
Dad,

479
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:35,280
will Mom, for real,

480
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,479
not have Little Grape?

481
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,879
Your Mom is having a hard time.

482
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:45,919
And now

483
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,520
grandpa is sick.

484
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,399
She must be under a lot of pressure.

485
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,879
A very hard time.

486
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,080
Especially for having a baby.

487
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,120
It is not something we can understand

488
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,399
simply by saying we can.

489
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,159
We can never experience it personally.

490
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,159
But I still want to persuade Mom

491
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,719
to keep Little Grape.

492
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,080
This matter,

493
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:13,040
shall be your mother's decision.

494
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,320
Let's not disturb her anymore.

495
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,679
I found you adults

496
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,080
are truly irresponsible.

497
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,639
Mom said it is an accident.

498
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,320
OK, I believe her.

499
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,479
I forgive you.

500
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,159
I accept Little Grape.

501
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,879
But now you say

502
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,080
that you don't want it anymore!

503
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,000
What a poor life.

504
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,360
Take a seat.

505
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:52,600
Dad,

506
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,879
I still want to try to persuade Mom.

507
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,840
If I don't try,

508
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,000
how do I know it's not working?

509
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,239
Are you afraid?

510
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
I'm not afraid.

511
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,399
I am waiting.

512
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:07,520
Although your mother

513
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,320
is a little bit incompetent sometimes,

514
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,959
she is very kind-hearted,

515
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,199
and very reliable.

516
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,560
About having child or not,

517
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,239
it is because that

518
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,040
she's under too much pressure recently.

519
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,479
She didn't think it through clearly.

520
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,199
We should give her some time.

521
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,320
She will figured it out by herself.

522
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,919
Furthermore, isn't your mother a

523
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,120
a person of strong self-consistency?

524
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,719
I do not express my opinion,

525
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:30,360
because I do not want to push her anymore.

526
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,959
Do you understand?

527
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,280
I don't want to emotionally

528
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,439
kidnap her.

529
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
What kidnapping?

530
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,679
I don't understand.

531
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,199
I just want to persuade her, again.

532
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,040
Tell her my opinion.

533
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,040
At this moment,

534
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,719
let's keep quiet.

535
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,399
No more persuading.

536
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,280
Why I told you this,

537
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,760
it is because that you are

538
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,959
a family member of us.

539
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,479
In this matter,

540
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,520
we should also reach a consensus.

541
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,040
No more persuasion.

542
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:03,560
We just watch and wait.

543
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,239
Wait for her decision.

544
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,600
But I just want to talk to her.

545
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,560
What?

546
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,719
Express my feeling.

547
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:51,520
Sister.

548
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,800
You came so early.

549
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,879
It's useless for you to stand here.

550
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,280
If Dad wakes up,

551
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,879
the doctor will call us.

552
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,800
Didn't you come here early, too?

553
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,879
I want to stay with Dad.

554
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,639
You're having a baby.

555
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,439
Go home.

556
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,439
When Dad awakes, I'll call you.

557
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,959
I am not going back.

558
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,520
You are having a baby, too.

559
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:33,879
Just sit and wait.

560
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,600
Sit down.

561
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,560
What are you doing?

562
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,320
Haowen.

563
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,000
Saving some money to Dad's account.

564
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
Wait, you...

565
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,239
It's done already.

566
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:18,600
It's done.

567
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,360
How much? Let's split.

568
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,360
Split what?

569
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,239
Come on.

570
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,199
If we don't split,

571
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:24,919
if Meng'an knows,

572
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:25,719
she will not agree.

573
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,679
Don't worry about it.

574
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:27,919
We are all family.

575
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,000
Your family, my family. Agree, not agree.

576
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:29,800
What's more,

577
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,320
after Xin giving birth to the child,

578
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,159
The task of taking care of Dad

579
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:32,560
will fall into

580
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,639
you and Meng'an.

581
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,600
That's one issue.

582
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,520
This is the other issue.

583
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,840
What are you talking about?

584
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,719
No, no, no.

585
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,520
You, you, you...

586
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,360
Just go, you.

587
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,879
You go away, please.

588
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,679
It's all my fault.

589
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,840
If it did not quarrel with Jia Haowen,

590
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,239
my mother-in-law would not argue with Dad.

591
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:54,879
Dad would not

592
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:56,560
suffer all these now.

593
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,199
It's all my fault.

594
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,000
Stop blaming yourself.

595
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,520
It's not your fault.

596
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,800
Yes it does!

597
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:12,840
Everyone said like this.

598
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,560
Mom also said that

599
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,120
it's okay.

600
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,479
That's not your fault.

601
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,320
I made such a big mess.

602
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,320
I know whether

603
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,520
it is my fault or not.

604
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,000
If it wasn't me,

605
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,679
Dad wouldn't be lying here.

606
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,719
I am responsible...

607
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,000
Listen to me,

608
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,199
don't cry anymore.

609
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,120
No crying.

610
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,959
I feel bad.

611
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,760
I know.

612
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,320
But what I said is true.

613
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,560
There must have been something

614
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,520
wrong with Dad's health before.

615
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,600
If he was really healthy,

616
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,600
can he faint because of anger?

617
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,360
It's just none of us

618
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,760
found it out before.

619
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,239
Don't cry.

620
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,520
Relax.

621
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:08,479
I feel suffocating.

622
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,479
Just speak out your feelings.

623
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,919
You need to stay here tonight.

624
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:25,879
Let's watch over

625
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,560
tonight.

626
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,879
Let the sisters

627
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:29,080
go back and have a rest, OK?

628
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,520
It is okay.

629
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,199
I am good on my own here.

630
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,159
Or I can get someone

631
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:34,080
from the company to help here.

632
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,919
No, no, no.

633
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:35,679
I have to be here.

634
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,760
So I can be assured.

635
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:37,959
Just lend me a hand.

636
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,560
I talked to your sister.

637
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,199
After Dad discharged from the hospital,

638
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:41,959
Our whole family

639
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:42,879
will move over

640
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:43,919
to take care of Dad.

641
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,280
You are

642
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,560
my role model!

643
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,800
What role model?

644
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
You're busy with work,

645
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,919
and Dad needs long-term care.

646
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,080
Someone must be around.

647
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,280
But

648
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,879
we should think positively.

649
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,120
How lucky Dad is!

650
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,520
Fortunately, he received timely treatment.

651
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,040
Is Dad awake?

652
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,919
Nurse!

653
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,919
[Nurse!]

654
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,320
Dad.

655
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,719
The stroke of Dad

656
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:29,959
reminds me of my childhood.

657
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,479
When Dad was sick,

658
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,000
only my mother could take care of him.

659
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,479
I was only 12 years old.

660
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,239
I went home and stepped on the stool

661
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,199
to cook.

662
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,080
All the relatives lived far away.

663
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,280
They could not help.

664
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,959
I am so envious of Xin.

665
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,719
She gets her sister to protect her.

666
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,719
I think,

667
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:47,959
I hope Yunjie and Xiongxiong

668
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:48,760
can have the support of younger siblings

669
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,239
when they grow up.

670
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,800
It will be good.

671
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,080
Yeah, sure.

672
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,479
It's good to have a big family.

673
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,080
Yeah, right.

674
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,600
Two kids in your family, two in mine.

675
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,199
That's eight members in total.

676
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,399
That's a flourishing family.

677
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,080
More people, more energy!

678
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,199
Who dares to mess with us?

679
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:08,479
Right?

680
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,080
Dad is awake.

681
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,320
Awake!

682
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,120
Hurry, go.

683
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,879
This way, this way.

684
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,639
Xin.

685
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
Dad woke up.

686
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,080
Why are you crying?

687
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,719
He doesn't blame me anymore.

688
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:31,000
He has forgiven me

689
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,840
Don't cry. Don't cry.

690
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:32,639
Be happy, cheer up.

691
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:33,280
Haowen.

692
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,280
I was scared.

693
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,879
It's okay.

694
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,199
Let's get some fresh air.

695
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,639
Don't cry, my dear wife.

696
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,320
Okay.

697
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,080
He has forgiven me.

698
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,919
Forgiven, forgiven.

699
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,320
Don't cry, honey.

700
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,760
No need to cry.

701
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,120
I'm happy.

702
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,040
That's good.

703
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:47,879
Alright.

704
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:49,520
The doctor said that

705
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,320
you wake up very quickly,

706
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,199
which means the condition is good.

707
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,040
You can be transferred to a regular ward

708
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,919
tomorrow or the day after.

709
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,919
I just called Mom.

710
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,320
She's on her way here, too.

711
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:06,560
She's fine.

712
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,639
You don't have to worry.

713
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,239
I think you will recover

714
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,080
very soon.

715
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,679
When you leave the hospital,

716
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,919
Yunjie and I will move back

717
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:19,800
to accompany you.

718
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,080
How about that?

719
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,959
What...

720
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,199
What are you saying?

721
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,280
The baby,

722
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,760
baby,

723
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,520
baby...

724
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,120
Dad.

725
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,319
Don't worry.

726
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,520
Dad is here.

727
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,639
Here.

728
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,040
No worry.

729
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,920
I will

730
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,719
look after.

731
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,440
Your job.

732
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,359
So you get recover quickly.

733
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:54,719
How is Dad?

734
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,520
Dad can't speak.

735
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,639
He can't speak.

736
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,159
He asks me to keep the baby.

737
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,359
How?

738
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,120
How can I?

739
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,639
He assured me not to worry.

740
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,120
But how?

741
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,639
What should I do?

742
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,319
The baby.

743
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,639
Dad's condition is stabilized.

744
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:45,359
He will be sent to a regular ward soon.

745
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,639
After Mom and Dad finished talking,

746
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,359
I'll take Mom

747
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,080
back home.

748
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,639
I'll stay here with my brother-in-law.

749
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,600
Don't worry, you two.

750
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:51,880
Sister.

751
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,799
Now Dad's awake,

752
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,359
we are more reassured.

753
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,799
Go back and rest, you two.

754
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,639
Where's Xiongxiong?

755
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,839
My Mom is with him.

756
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,799
Sister,

757
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:04,120
can you

758
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,359
follow me back to my home, OK?

759
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,839
Can you stay with me?

760
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:09,239
You should go back together.

761
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm not reassured either

762
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,759
to leave you home alone.

763
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:14,520
Let's go.

764
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:15,639
Come on. The car is here.

765
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,480
Take care, sister.

766
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,199
Take care, Xin.

767
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,239
Then you watch over Dad.

768
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,880
No worry.

769
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,839
Safe driving.

770
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:25,560
[Okay.]

771
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,239
Let's go.

772
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,880
OK.

773
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,799
Your mother-in-law is at home with the kid?

774
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
Don't blame my mother-in-law.

775
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,759
She didn't know the injury of Haowen

776
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,120
is an accident.

777
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,560
So she came to argue with Dad.

778
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,159
Put ourselves in her shoes.

779
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,359
If I were injured,

780
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,400
you, Mom and Dad,

781
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,120
will also find my mother-in-law

782
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,960
and stand up for me.

783
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,199
Right?

784
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,839
Now

785
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,600
you try to defend her.

786
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,719
Can't you just be nice

787
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,960
to her when you are together?

788
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,400
I was nice to her before.

789
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:14,319
Really.

790
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,159
I don't know why.

791
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:17,600
It seems that

792
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,279
since I became pregnant,

793
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:23,199
I couldn't get along well with anyone.

794
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,239
I think it must be

795
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,960
because of the progesterone.

796
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,679
Maybe, after I deliver my baby,

797
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,440
everything will be fine.

798
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,400
Dad is sick now.

799
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,960
Mom must be fragile, too.

800
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,600
So can you behave

801
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,199
carefully these days?

802
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,400
I promise,

803
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,359
I will behave well.

804
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,000
You just go to work,

805
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,359
and do your things as usual.

806
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,199
I have nothing to do at home anyway.

807
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,080
After Dad leaves the hospital,

808
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,440
I will take care of him every day.

809
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,480
I can hire a nurse for him.

810
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,560
Give him massage.

811
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:53,880
Take him out for walk.

812
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,359
If one nurse is not enough,

813
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,440
I'll get two.

814
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,679
I'll buy Dad

815
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,400
an advanced electric wheelchair.

816
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:02,600
So he can go wherever he wants.

817
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,520
Travel to anywhere

818
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,400
he wants.

819
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,880
He can go out easily.

820
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,880
In that case

821
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,000
the courtyard of Mom and Dad

822
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,520
shall carry out barrier-free renovation.

823
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:12,920
So does my villa.

824
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,799
Or we sell it and buy a large apartment.

825
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
No steps in the home.

826
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:16,880
Right?

827
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:18,759
Let me think about the designing.

828
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,359
Dad is just inarticulate for now.

829
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,839
It doesn't mean he needs wheelchair.

830
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,199
Yes.

831
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,199
Yes, he is inarticulate.

832
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,199
Why did it happen to him?

833
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,040
He's so talkative.

834
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,359
How can he chat with others in the future?

835
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,159
It can be improved with rehabilitation.

836
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:54,880
He will be okay.

837
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,040
By the way,

838
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:00,120
what did Dad tell you

839
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,239
in the ward just now?

840
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,000
Nothing.

841
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:07,639
I couldn't hear it clearly.

842
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:32,080
Mom.

843
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,319
Mom.

844
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:35,719
The big sister has come.

845
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,679
How is your father?

846
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,719
He has woken up.

847
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,080
Fortunately Haowen

848
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,719
sent him to hospital immediately.

849
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,719
The doctor also said

850
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:45,920
that the rescue was prompt.

851
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,560
Great.

852
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,639
That's great.

853
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,520
Thank you, Meng'an.

854
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,839
Our Haowen,

855
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,679
has to thank you for the support.

856
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,960
Otherwise, he won't have been able to live

857
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,440
such a good life.

858
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:58,560
Don't say that.

859
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,000
It is Haowen's own efforts.

860
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:01,920
Well,

861
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,279
please focus on your family recently.

862
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,960
Leave Xiongxiong to me.

863
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,560
I am his grandmother.

864
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,480
You can trust me.

865
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,719
Don't let him play with his phone.

866
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,000
How should you speak like that?

867
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,199
Thank you so much, Mom.

868
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,679
Then you take a rest.

869
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,920
I'm going to check on Xiongxiong.

870
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,520
OK.

871
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,719
No hurry.

872
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:24,560
OK.

873
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,759
I don't want to comment on

874
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,040
your emotional intelligence.

875
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,759
[Wanzhen,]

876
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,480
our group

877
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,239
is marching into the financial industry.

878
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,520
These are the financial products

879
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,359
of our company.

880
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:45,199
And the sales of financial products

881
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,359
belong to your performances.

882
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,120
Look,

883
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,960
your sales are pretty good recently.

884
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:49,880
You can take part of

885
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,120
the sales commissions

886
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,679
and convert them to

887
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,960
the financial products of same values.

888
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,239
You will get high profit.

889
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:54,960
Mr. Qian,

890
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,520
We are a real estate company.

891
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,080
Selling financial products...

892
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,880
I think we need certain qualifications.

893
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,880
Of course we have.

894
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,639
Our company

895
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:03,679
has a special financial department.

896
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:04,600
Look,

897
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
as for your premium clients,

898
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,639
especially those who

899
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:08,080
have no intention to buy houses recently,

900
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,719
you can recommend them

901
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,560
the financial products.

902
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:10,520
The financial department

903
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,839
will send special personnel to follow up.

904
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:12,920
Isn't it more profitable

905
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,520
than selling one house by another?

906
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:15,799
I prefer

907
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:17,000
to sell the house one after another.

908
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,319
So stubborn.

909
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,000
Tonight

910
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:19,839
I'll introduce you to some

911
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,520
colleagues in the financial department.

912
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:22,719
Wanzhen,

913
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,759
at last dinner

914
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:24,719
you showed us your competency.

915
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,560
You should take advantage of the victory.

916
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,120
No, not tonight.

917
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,120
I have to take my children to the class.

918
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:31,239
I can go.

919
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,239
I am available.

920
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:32,960
Then you can talk.

921
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:33,839
I have some work to do.

922
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,319
OK.

923
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,480
Is this financial product

924
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,839
that profitable?

925
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,000
The higher the principal, the more profit.

926
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,679
And if I recommend more clients,

927
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:45,839
I can get extra commission?

928
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,799
Higher than selling the house, for sure.

929
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,199
Mr. Qian,

930
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,920
Then I will follow you to make fortune.

931
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,000
Why not.

932
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,480
Then, perform well at dinner this time.

933
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,520
You already know

934
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,719
my drinking competency.

935
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Go ahead, get ready.

936
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,560
Thank you, Mr. Qian.
