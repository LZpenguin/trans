00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,920
I am deeply grieved

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Yes, Sir.

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
My lord, thank you

14
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760

to console his family.

19
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,200
His father has been

20
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,840
raising pigeons there all his life.

After I return,

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
we can further discuss how to

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,320
[take down the masked spectre.]

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,120

Mo Qianzhi, the magistrate of Yingzhou,

30

[I command you to secretly investigate.]

[Could Biqiu]

[have been a spy planted by]

[Was Biqiu]

[the middleman for my secret messages?]

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,640
It's okay now.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
What's wrong?

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
I think

42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,720
I know why Biqiu was killed,

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,280
but I can't tell you.

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,080
It's okay.

45
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,440
You don't have to if you don't want to.

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,320
Shen Du,

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,840
do you trust me?

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,120
If one day,

49
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
I stood against

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,320
your dearest one,

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,200
would you still trust me?

52

Aren't you my

dearest one?

54
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,000
I apologize.

55
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,680
So it looks like this lead was wrong.

56
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,240
The lead claimed the masked spectres

57
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,680
had been spotted outside the city,

58
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,360
but there's not a soul in sight,

59

60

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,960
what's going on today?

63
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Why isn't there

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,320
even a street vendor

65
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,120

the masked spectre

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,920
killed Mr. Biqiu at the yamen.

72
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,000
I heard the scene was gruesome.

73
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,560
[He was even skinned!]

74
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,040
[No one dares to come out anymore.]

75
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,240
[I only came out]

76
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,640
[because I had to bring some medicine]

77
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,720
[to my mother outside the city.]

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,320

82

knew about the murder

83
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,200
at around 3 a.m.

84
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
How did the public

85
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,960
find out about this?

86
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,240
This is indeed suspicious.

87

How dare you be so audacious!

134
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,080
Biqiu was devoted to the people,

as everyone in Yingzhou knows.

136
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
[Yet you mercilessly murdered him,]

You are utterly ruthless!

So you don't agree then.

141
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,240
Do you want everyone in the city dead

142
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
or what?

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Kill them!

144
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
Damn it.

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,880
Kill them all!

146
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,880
Close the gates!

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,640

How is he?

154
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Much alive.

155
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,720
This dart is poisonous.

156
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,800
We need to stop the bleeding now.

157
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
You stay here.

158
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,200
Don't come out no matter what.

159
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,200
Hold on.

160
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,560
Pan Chi, hold on.

161
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
Pan Chi, stay with me.

162

Pan Chi! Pan Chi!

166
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,640
I never thought

167
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,240
one day you would be

168
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,600
holding a sword to my neck.

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,080
Order them to stop the arrows.

170
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm afraid I can't.

171
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Now there's finally a chance

172
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,920
to take out the Masked Spectre,

173
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,280
how could I let him go?

174
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,480
For the people in Yingzhou,

175
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,080
I'd rather wrongful kill than to let him go.

176
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
If I kill anyone innocent,

177
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm willing to repay with my life!

178
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Killing an official incurs death penalty.

179
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,520
My lord,

180
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,520
don't threaten me with the death penalty.

181
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,960
I put the people first

182
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
and want to take down the Masked Spectre

183
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,280
to return peace to them.

184
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
I would say the same thing

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,280
even in front of Her Highness.

186
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
Open your eyes and see!

187
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,520
Is this the result you want?

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,240
[If Xiuxiu were here,]

196
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,920
Good.

197
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,880
It's really you.

198
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
[Ji Dafu,]

199
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,800
first, you killed Li Kaixiang,

200
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,800
then framed Li Kairui for it,

201
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
and now you're using Liu Zongyuan

202
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
as a scapegoat.

203
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,080
What are you really up to?

204
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,160
I didn't frame Li Kairui.

205
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,520
I even paid to help him clear his name.

206
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,320
As for Li Kaixiang,

207
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,720
so what if I killed him?

208
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,200
He deserved to die,

209
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,000
so did Liu Zongyuan.

210
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,280
Those foolish commoners.

211
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,640
They are not worth grieving over.

212
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,640
Perhaps you are

213
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,880
the most foolish of all.

214
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,040
[The people you've killed]

215
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,080
[were all innocent.]

216
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,560
You were a son and a husband.

217
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,160
You also have parents and a wife.

218
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
[Do you know how painful it is]

219
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,040
to lose a loved one?

220
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,120
Shut up.

221
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,480
How could I not know

222
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,640
the pain

223
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,600
of losing a loved one?

224
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,280
But when I saw Xiulian,

225
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,160
she... she was barely recognizable,

226
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,280
completely mutilated.

227
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,240
But they had promised me

228
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,640
they would bring Xiulian back to life!

229
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
She will be back!

230
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,040
Who are they?

231
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,880
They promised you

232
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,360
they would bring Xiulian back to life?

233
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,200
It's a pity

234
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
[that you don't look like her.]

235

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,520
The Masked Spectre's lost a piece of

his clothes during the fight,

244
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,720
[and it had a strong medicinal smell.]

245

00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,480
he gouged out Er Laipi's eyes,

350
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,960
[beheaded Li Kaixiang,]

351
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,480
[and took Liu Zongyuan's liver.]

352
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,600
His crimes are unforgivable, and only

353
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,440
his death can bring justice to the people!

354
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,920
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

355
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,920
[Kill him!]

356
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,960
[He killed so many people.]

357
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,480
He deserves more than death!

358
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,200
[That's right!]

359
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,520
[His crimes are unforgivable,]

360
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,720
[and even a thousand cuts wouldn't be]

361
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,040
[enough to bring justice to the people.]

362
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,160
[He deserves more than death!]

363
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,200
[Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!]

364
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,040
[Kill him now!]

365
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,000
[He deserves to die!]

366
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,840
Ji Dafu ran an illegal gambling den

367
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,920
and murdered your families.

368
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,000
[His crimes are unforgivable.]

369
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,880
Execute him now!

370
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,040
Wait!

371
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,640
Lady Yan, what do you mean?

372
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
Are you

373
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
trying to plead for Ji Dafu?

374
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Some details of this case remain unclear.

375
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,280
Ji Dafu has confessed

376
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,120
to all his crimes,

377
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,200
[and the evidence is undeniable.]

378
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,680
It's time.

379
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,960
Execute him at once!

380
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,920
My lord,

381
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,080
weren't you the one who

382
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,840
wanted to bring justice to the people?

383
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,600
So why are you trying to

384
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,280
save this vile criminal now?

385
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:18,680
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

386
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,960
I can't die! I can't die!

387
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,960
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!

388
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,120
I don't want to die!

389
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,720
Yeah!

390
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,160
Good! Yes! Yes!

391
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,040
[Good! Good! Yes!]

392
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,040
He deserved it!

393
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,480
Justice to all!

394
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,960
Good! Good!

395
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,480
[Yes! Yeah!]

396
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,880
Yes!

397
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,800
[My lord,]

398
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,440
what I did

399
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,520
was what the people wanted.

400
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,240
[Mr. Mo, you are truly wise.]

401
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,840
The scent on him-

402
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,000
I recognized it from where I was held.

403
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,360
Jing Lin.

404
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,000
Yes, Sir.

405
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,160
Look into it.

406
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Yes, Sir.

407
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,520
He is the Chief of the IG,

408
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,680
the infamous White Death of Xiang'an?

409
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,440
[Why did he try to stop the execution?]

410
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,400
[Who knows?]

411
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,640
[What goes around comes around.]

412
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,600
[Enough of that.]

413
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Let's get out of here.

414
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,720
Let's go. Let's go.

415
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,560
My lord,

416
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,640
secret report from Yingzhou says that

417
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
[Ji Dafu is dead,]

418
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,560
[and the situation has changed.]

419
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,080
They need to proceed with caution now.

420
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,840
Forget it.

421
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880
It's just a trivial matter,

422
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,480
not important.

423
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,840
Yingzhou is only the beginning.

424
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,440
One shot alone can't win the battle.

425
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,440
Stay vigilant in other cities.

426
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,200
[Catching them off guard]

427
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,920
is the key to our success.

428
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,920
Yes, my lord.

429
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,080
How are

430
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,480
the arrangements in Nanlang and Xichen?

431
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,800
[Everything has been done as you ordered.]

432
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,040
Good.

433
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,840
If heaven assists me,

434
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,800
I will triumph.

435
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
If not,

436
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,560
I will defy heaven.

437
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,160
The people of Yingzhou

438
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
are all happy about

439
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,240
Ji Dafu's death.

440
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,760
That's evident.

441
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,880
Ji Dafu has committed many heinous crimes.

442
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,320
And the masked spectre case

443
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,640
has caused great fear

444
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,440
among the people of Yingzhou.

445
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,680
They hated him deeply.

446
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,600
Now that he's been brought to justice,

447
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
of course they would be happy.

448
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,040
Such a shame.

449
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,280
The people are all praising

450
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,800
Mo Qianzhi for his action.

451
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,000
But Ji Dafu

452
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,080
has clearly been severely tortured

453
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,240
and has lost his sanity.

454
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
We have lost our lead yet again.

455
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,760
Now the people of Yingzhou

456
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
have all seen

457
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,160
Mo Qianzhi's firm stance against evil

458
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,280
and his decision on execution,

459
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,040
and it was me

460
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
who tried to stop it.

461
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,840
One is praised by everyone,

462
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,720
the other

463
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,120
is the fearsome

464
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
[White Death.]

465
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,600
[To you and Mr. Mo,]

466
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
the people hold

467
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,520
completely opposite views.

468
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,640
As long as I am at peace with myself,

469
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,400
I don't fear what people say.

470
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,200
But what people say can be fearsome.

471
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm just afraid that...

472
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,320
Lord Mo's

473
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,800
public execution of Ji Dafu might

474
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,560
seems like a way to soothe the people,

475
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,560
but it's a bit odd and

476
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,120
inconsistent

477
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,640
with his usual

478
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
meticulous approach.

479
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,600
When the Masked Spectre

480
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,120
was causing chaos in the city that day,

481
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,120
he brought up the Three Yang's Day.

482
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,040
I remember Qianzhi's expression

483
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,560
was somewhat unusual.

484
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,520
What's special about the Three Yang's Day?

485
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,880
It's coming up soon right?

486
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,240
Wait a second,

487
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,040
my mom told me

488
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,560
that this year's Three Yangs' Day

489
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
is indeed different from before-

490
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,080
it's the once-in-a-decade

491
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,320
ominous day.

492
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,480
Ominous day?

493
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,760
What does that mean?

494
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,480
Meaning lots of ill omens.

495
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,720
She asked me to be extra careful

496
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,520
and not to go outside.

497
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,240
Of course,

498
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,880
my mom tends to believe everything.

499
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,160
It was only hearsay.

500
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,720
Mo Qianzhi, as I know him,

501
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,080
would not care about such things.

502
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,840
My lord.

503
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
Did you find anything?

504
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,600
As you have predicted,

505
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,440
I visited several households

506
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,840
and found that the women

507
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,400
taken by the Masked Spectre that day

508
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
were all rescued by the officials

509
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,480
of Mr. Mo's Yamen.

510
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,800
[However,]

511
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,440
there was no news of them

512
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,920
being sent back home.

513
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,680
What?

514
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,160
Then where are those women?

515
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,960
Did Mr. Mo

516
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,440
really take them?

517
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,000
It seems that the Masked Spectre

518
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,760
didn't take those women randomly,

519
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,960
he had chosen those specific women

520
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,280
for a reason.

521
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
[But I've looked into it.]

522
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,680
Those women all had

523
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
different

524
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,840
family backgrounds.

525
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,880
It's Mo Xiuxiu.

526
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,040
Xiuxiu?

527
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,360
Do you

528
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,440
remember the portrait of Mo Xiuxiu

529
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,800
in the Mo residence?

530
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,800
Including Du Xiaowan,

531
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,080
the five women

532
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,480
abducted by the Masked Spectre

533
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,880
that day all shared

534
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,520
a resemblance

535
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,800
to Mo Xiuxiu.

536
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,120
What if that wasn't

537
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,360
just a coincidence?

538
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,080
Ji Dafu is dead, but

539
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,120
the trouble in Yingzhou is far from over.

540
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,840
If our suspicions are correct,

541
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,080
Mo Qianzhi could have colluded with

542
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
the Fire Moth Sect for long.

543
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,120
On the Three Yang's Day,

544
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,120
they will make a move again.

545
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,200
So what do we do next?

546
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,240
-Find.
[-Find.]

547
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,400
Find?

548
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,160
Find.

549
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,480
Those women who were taken

550
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,680
are the key.

551
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,480
Yingzhou is a big city.

552
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,440
Where could he be hiding them?

553
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,920
[In the least likely places]

554
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,200
[of course.]

555
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,440
My Lord,

556
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
everything is ready.

557
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,080
[Wait for the timing.]

558
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,520
Good.

559
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,040
Xiuxiu,

560
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,760
no matter what,

561
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,040
[I will activate the formation today]

562
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,280
[and bring you back.]

563
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
[Mr. Mo,]

564
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,240
please let me go.

565
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,360
[I have been obedient.]

566
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,720
[Please spare my life.]

567
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,240
[Let me go.]

568
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,520
I don't want to die.

569
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,520
Jing Lin.

570
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,160
Xiuxiu.

571
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,120
Thank goodness we got here in time.

572
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
They are all alive.

573
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,040
Xiu?

574
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,160
Qianzhi.

575
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,600
Qianzhi,

576
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,760
how does this look?

577
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,000
[It's very pretty.]

578
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,240
[Qianzhi.]

579
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Mr. Mo.

580
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,120
It's not possible.

581
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,600
Xiuxiu wouldn't call me Mr. Mo.

582
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,320
She only calls me Qianzhi.

583
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,280
[It's not possible.]

584
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,840
It couldn't have failed.

585
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
It couldn't have failed!

586
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
It's you.

587
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,400
You scared away Xiuxiu's spirit

588
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,920
so she couldn't find the way back.

589
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,840
Shen Du,

590
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
how can you be so cruel!

591
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,920
There's no such thing

592
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,160
as resurrection in this world.

593
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,080
He has gone mad

594
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,360
to the point of losing his humanity.

595
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Humanity?

596
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,600
Don't judge

597
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,960
unless you've been in my shoes.

598
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,920
[Shen Du,]

599
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,360
[you should know this]

600
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,240
[better than anyone.]

601
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,360
If it were possible to bring back

602
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,360
those who died unjustly,

603
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,520
what would you choose?

604
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,520
[Xiuxiu]

605
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,160
was the kindest,

606
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,000
the purest person in the world.

607
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,960
But those vile men

608
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,240
forced her to die.

609
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,400
Mo Xiuxiu

610
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,520
didn't die from illness?

611
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,200
What

612
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,040
really happened to Xiuxiu?

613
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,080
Before Xiuxiu died,

614
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,840
she kept asking

615
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
'why'.

616
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,280
[What did she do which is wrong?]

617
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,880
[Please give us some food.]

618
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Please give us some food.

619
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,840
What's going on?

620
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,960
[Sir,]

621
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,440
[some refugees blocked our path.]

622
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,280
Give them some food.

623
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,920
[Yes, Sir.]

624
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,720
Qianzhi,

625
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,160
the closer we get to Yingzhou,

626
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,520
the more refugees we encounter.

627
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,560
In the future,

628
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,320
if you take over Gannan,

629
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I hope you will

630
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,840
help and protect these refugees

631
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,400
and give them a safe place to live.

632
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,680
My dear sister,

633
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,000
you are too kind.

634
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,440
[Here, Xiuxiu.]

635
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,400
[Welcome!]

636
00:34:58,759 --> 00:34:59,799
Please, come in.

637
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,759
Let's just stay here for the night.

638
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:03,440
The horses must be exhausted too.

639
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,000
Come in. Come in.

640
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,880
Miss,

641
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,279
do you not feel unwell?

642
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,040
Let me help you to

643
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
rest over there.

644
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,960
No need, no need.

645
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,839
My family needs water urgently.

646
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,480
I must bring it back quickly.

647
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,080
You look very kind.

648
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,440
Will you please accompany me a bit?

649
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,520
Okay.

650
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,760
I'll help you get home.

651
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,880
Thank you, Miss.

652
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,320
Let's go.

653
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,400
Help! Help!

654
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,200
I just ran into some bad people.

655
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
My family is waiting for me at the station.

656
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,680
Would you please help me get back there?

657
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,440
Don't worry.

658
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,080
I will help you.

659
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,400
Xiuxiu!

660
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,360
Don't come near.

661
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,680
No!

662
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,960
Don't come near!

663
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,560
[Xiuxiu!]

664
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:13,960
[Xiuxiu!]

665
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,200
It's okay now.

666
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,880
Come back with me.

667
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,480
[No one will hurt you ever again.]

668
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,120
No.

669
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,080
I made a mistake,

670
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,840
Qianzhi.

671
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,680
[But I only wanted to help her.]

672
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,920
What did I do which is wrong?

673
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,640
Xiuxiu.

674
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,800
Xiuxiu!

675
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,360
[No!]

676
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,160
Xiuxiu!

677
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,800
Xiuxiu!

678
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,840
[Qianzhi.]

679
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,120
Who are you?

680
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,320
It doesn't matter who I am.

681
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
But if you want to bring back your sister,

682
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,400
I can help you with that.

683
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,440
Bring the dead back to life?

684
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,240
That's absurd.

685
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,000
The world is vast

686
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,320
and full of wonders.

687
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,000
Just because you've not seen it in Cang

688
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,600
[doesn't mean it doesn't exist.]

689
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,600
As long as your heart is sincere enough.

690
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Can you truly

691
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,600
bring the dead back to life?

692
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,680
Of course.

693
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,760
The fire moth rises from the ashes.

694
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,000
That is the essence of the Fire Moth Sect.

695
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,600
[If you wish to follow me,]

696
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,720
then I

697
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,200
can resurrect your sister.

698
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,120
As long as you can bring back Xiuxiu,

699
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,080
I, Mo Qianzhi,

700
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
would do anything for you.

701
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,280
[These so-called secrets to resurrection]

702
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,840
are just ploys

703
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,400
to manipulate people.

704
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,480
You were lost in your obsession.

705
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,000
That's why you believed it.

706
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,960
Qianzhi,

707
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,960
did you really not know

708
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,680
that it was because of your protection

709
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,320
that the Fire Moth Sect has ravaged

710
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,560
Gannan for years,

711
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,120
killing countless people?

712
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,240
[How could you still believe]

713
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,720
[they could bring back Mo Xiuxiu?]

714
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Why shouldn't I?

715
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
[What reason do I have not to?]

716
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
[As long as I can bring back Xiuxiu,]

717
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,960
[what does it matter]

718
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,280
[killing a few more?]

719
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,240
Those bastards,

720
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,280
didn't they deserve to die?

721
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,000
The Masked Spectre of Guangchun Hall

722
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,920
killed them for me.

723
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,240
[Xiuxiu helped those refugees,]

724
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,480
[but then she was humiliated by those]

725
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,600
[vile men and jumped off a cliff.]

726
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,160
[How could I not avenge her for that?]

727
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,400
Help me! Help me!

728
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,480
Someone wants to kill me!

729
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:38,880
Don't be scared.

730
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,280
Help me!

731
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,080
We are in broad daylight.

732
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,200
Do you have no regard for the law?

733
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,280
Mr. Mo is here.

734
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,320
We will protect you.

735
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,800
It's them.

736
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,120
They want to kill me!

737
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,760
Why do they want to kill you?

738
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,200
Xiuxiu,

739
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,800
I will avenge you.

740
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
They all deserved to die!

741
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,160
They should all die for their sin!

742
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,400
[Shen Du, why]

743
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,040
[did you sabotage the sacrificial ritual?]

744
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,320
Why?

745
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,880
You just didn't want Xiuxiu to come back.

746
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,160
Those men deserved to die,

747
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,800
but what about them?

748
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
What did they do which is wrong?

749
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,280
Things are just not fair in this world.

750
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,680
[Shen Du,]

751
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,640
you know that well.

752
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,880
By using others' lives as sacrifices,

753
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,240
you're trading five lives

754
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,040
for the resurrection you want?

755
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,040
[Even if you were to succeed,]

756
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,360
do you really think Xiuxiu

757
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,560
would be at peace with it?

758
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,840
Qianzhi,

759
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,480
Xiuxiu is gone.

760
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,560
Xiuxiu is not dead.

761
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,160
I will bring her back.

762
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,480
Guards.

763
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,560
Using resurrection

764
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,360
as a means of manipulation

765
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
and performing rituals

766
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,600
with human organs.

767
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,560
So that means,

768
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,200
Lady Tang's removal of the victims' organs

769
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,880
after her killings might also be

770
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,640
influenced by the Fire Moth Sect and

771
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,160
was intended for the resurrecting ritual.

772
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Creating mystery.

773
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,440
Spreading fear.

774
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,440
That's how the Fire Moth Sect

775
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,320
maintains control over their followers-

776
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,160
through intimidation and fear.

777
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,400
Xiu.

778
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,800
Be careful.

779
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,320
Careful.

780
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,200
Lady Yan,

781
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
is there really no way

782
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,440
to bring someone back to life?
