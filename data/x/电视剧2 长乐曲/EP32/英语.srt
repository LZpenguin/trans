3
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,560
I didn't plan to keep you

4
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,120
and Lady Shen here today.

5
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
No need to be so uptight.

6
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,280
However, I still want to offer you both

7
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
a piece of advice.

8
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,400
The criminals apprehended by the

9
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,720
Imperial Inspectorate aren't ones you can

10
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
simply exonerate at will.

11
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
You'd better consider carefully

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,920
which words to heed,

13
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,040
which words to report,

14
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
Some things

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,640
are best kept to yourself.

16
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,600
Don't bring trouble upon

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,680
yourself and your family.

18
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
What exactly is Lai Luozhi's intention?

19
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,520
Do you doubt Sun Tan's words?

20
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Absolutely not.

21
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,960
It's just that the looming truth

22
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
is far too frightening.

23
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,960
It's genuinely unsettling.

24
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,240
But just as Lai Luozhi mentioned,

25
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,240
we were only speculating,

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,280
there's no concrete proof.

27
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,920
I'm afraid that for now,

28
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,680
it's difficult to take action against him.

29
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,120
And what about

30
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,680
Sun Tan's testimony?

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
I will, of course, report it honestly.

32
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
Xing,

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,080
gratitude!

34
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,640
Scribe Lu,

35
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,160
you honor us with your presence,

36
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,040
yet you're leaving without

37
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,800
so much as a greeting?

38
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,560
What's going on?

39
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,160
It appears you're scared of me again.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
You...

41
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Have you been

42
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
arresting a lot of officials lately?

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,160
Yes, that's true.

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,360
You and your

45
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,840
nosy friend

46
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,480
came to the Imperial Inspectorate

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,040
because of this, right?

48
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,600
What exactly are you trying to do?

49
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,560
You're not planning to

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,640
harm Yan Xing, are you?

51
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
That's really not fair.

52
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,320
You claimed I am your friend,

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,480
so why is your worry

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
solely about me hurting her

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
and not about

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,240
whether she might

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,840
sabotage my plans?

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
I don't consider people like you as friends.

59
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm warning you,

60
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
you absolutely must not harm Yan Xing.

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,880
If anything

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,240
happens to her,

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,960
I will never forgive you!

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
Then we'll see

65
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
what her true intentions are.

66
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,560
You work at the Ministry of Justice,

67
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,480
so what were you doing at II?

68
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,920
And even entered the palace

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,800
to submit an appeal to Lady Xu?

70
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,560
Are you still having your guardsmen

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,400
keeping an eye on me?

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Do you realize...

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,280
that the moment you stepped out of

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
the Imperial Inspectorate

75
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
with Sun Tan's testimony,

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,560
your head

77
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,880
was no longer safe on your shoulders?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,320
But Sun Tan suspects that

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Lai Luozhi is plotting to seize control of

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,840
the Gannan garrison and may even conspire

81
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,880
with nomadic tribes for sinister purposes.

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,600
With such crucial military intelligence,

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
shouldn't it be reported to Her Majesty?

84
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Moreover,

85
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,440
you also want to save Sun Tan, right?

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,800
Sun Tan had been quite beneficial to us

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,520
in Gannan,

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,600
so, I want to save him for sure.

89
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
But I prefer you stay out of harm's way.

90
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
I understand your nature, and I'm not

91
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,440
trying to hinder your investigation.

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
However, moving forward,

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,680
you need to be more cautious.

94
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,120
Next time you face a challenge,

95
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,920
remember that your husband,

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,440
is the commander of the Imperial Guard.

97
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,600
I worry that I might bring you trouble.

98
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
If trouble was what I feared,

99
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,360
I wouldn't be marrying you.

100
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,680
My love,

101
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,200
what do you think Her Majesty

102
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,680
will decide after reviewing

103
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,160
Sun Tan's testimony?

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
I can't say for sure.

105
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,440
My actions today have truly

106
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
provoked Lai Luozhi.

107
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
I can't even discern

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
if I'm truly aiding Sun Tan

109
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,080
or inadvertently putting him in jeopardy.

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,360
As long as your conscience remains clear,

111
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,520
don't fret about what lies ahead.

112
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Since you've allied with Yan Xing

113
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
and Xu Xiangren against me,

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,360
you must be fully aware

115
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,960
of the consequences

116
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,040
that await you.

117
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,120
However,

118
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
you still have a chance to survive.

119
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,720
if you provide me with a list

120
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,720
of the bandits Xu Xiangren

121
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,120
was associated with before

122
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
he became the Chief Inspector.

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,919
I assure you,

124
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,360
you can walk out of here alive,

125
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,120
and even secure

126
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,799
the position of the next Chief Inspector.

127
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
You want me to frame Chief?

128
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,640
Xu Xiangren

129
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
is quite a thorn to me.

130
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
Do you know how Xu Xiangren came to

131
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,240
hold the position of

132
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,640
the Chief Inspector?

133
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
Years ago, he made three bets

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,960
with the current queen

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,600
to steal treasures from the palace.

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,680
He actually succeeded in

137
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,280
taking treasures from

138
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,120
the heavily guarded palace.

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,800
Her Majesty recognized his talent,

140
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,400
which is why she allowed him

141
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
to succeed Chief Yuan.

142
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
With your capabilities,

143
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,240
how could you possibly take him on?

144
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,640
He's a tough nut to crack, but

145
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,440
it depends on what you use to break him.

146
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,800
All you need to do is provide the list,

147
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,040
and leave the rest

148
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
to the Imperial Inspectorate.

149
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,360
This should be easy for you,

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,360
and it's not really a betrayal,

151
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,440
is it?

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,400
Don't you aspire to become

153
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
the Chief Inspector who commands

154
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,400
all the delinquents?

155
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,280
I do...

156
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
I truly desire it!

157
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,280
The command token for

158
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
all the delinquents;

159
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,400
I genuinely want it!

160
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,040
I'll wait for your list.

161
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,160
What did you steal?

162
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,200
Stay out of my way!

163
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,040
Even thieves have their code of honor.

164
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,600
You stole

165
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
and then employed such a brutal move.

166
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,480
Today, I'll make you...

167
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
Don't hurt Tan!

168
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
Go! All of you!

169
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,720
Let Tan go!

170
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
We'll give you all our food!

171
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Just run!

172
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,680
He stole things

173
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,200
just to feed all of you?

174
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
Tan is a good man.

175
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
If it weren't for him,

176
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
I would have starved to death.

177
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,640
Leave!

178
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,560
Don't hurt him, sir.

179
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
He is a good man.

180
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
Yeah, he is a good man.

181
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,880
Don't hit him.

182
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,960
From now on, stop stealing.

183
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,000
Just join me.

184
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,040
Quit pretending to be a good person!

185
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
You hardly look like

186
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,640
someone wealthy.

187
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,480
You might have stolen less than I have!

188
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,920
It's just that my skills aren't there yet.

189
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,280
Once I hone my skills, I'll even swipe

190
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,880
the treasures from the royal palace!

191
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,360
Sounds good.

192
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,520
Just you wait,

193
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,640
I'll go and steal

194
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,080
some treasures from the palace

195
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,440
to show you all!

196
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,600
Easy.

197
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
Did you really steal all these

198
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
from the palace?

199
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,600
I've made a promise to the queen

200
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
that from now on, I'll take the

201
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,880
position as the Chief Inspector

202
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,360
who commands all the delinquents

203
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,240
in the empire.

204
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,320
Join me,

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,640
and we'll all

206
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,040
be delinquents.

207
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,520
Being merely a delinquent isn't enough.

208
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
I aim to be a

209
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,840
Chief Inspector.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

211
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,040
You are ambitious, good.

212
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,640
Then you'll need to find a way

213
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,760
to defeat me.

214
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Get down.

215
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,040
Once I get stronger,

216
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,080
I will take you down!

217
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,200
Alright then.

218
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Then I make you this promise:

219
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,520
If I ever meet my end,

220
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
the token of the Chief Inspector

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,040
will be yours to claim.

222
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,760
Fair enough.

223
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,160
I promise you,

224
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,960
I'll join the ranks of the Delinquents

225
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
until the day you take your last breath.

226
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,560
[I'm not dead yet,]

227
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
[and this token]

228
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,880
[is still waiting for you to claim it!]

229
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,280
But you're still alive,

230
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,160
how could I possibly take your token...

231
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,240
Xing,

232
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,840
the documents from the

233
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,760
Imperial Inspectorate are here for you.

234
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,120
I thought

235
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,520
Lai Luozhi would cause you trouble,

236
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,600
but seeing you alright today

237
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,520
puts my mind at ease.

238
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,840
Xing,

239
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,000
what does it say?

240
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
"Sun Tan took his own life out of guilt..."

241
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,760
He really is gone...

242
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,320
Lai Luozhi,

243
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,880
that bastard!

244
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,800
Xiangren,

245
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm the one who caused Sun Tan's demise!

246
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,280
Chief anticipated you'd think this way,

247
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
so as soon as we received the news,

248
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,360
we rushed over.

249
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,880
What Sun Tan wanted to express has already

250
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,960
been conveyed through your memo.

251
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,360
He chose to end his life

252
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,600
partly to protect

253
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
the brothers in Gannan.

254
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Also,

255
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,000
he must have wanted to keep me safe.

256
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,520
Brother,

257
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
rest in peace!

258
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,239
Xing!

259
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,239
Why were you drinking?

260
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,080
I got you.

261
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,920
Watch your step.

262
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,480
Was it because of Sun Tan?

263
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,480
Sun Tan is a genuine hero,

264
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,080
through and through.

265
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,800
I failed to keep him alive.

266
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,920
I originally

267
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,200
planned to plead for him today,

268
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,760
but it was too late.

269
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,320
Sun Tan's death is so unjust...

270
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,800
Here, read this.

271
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,400
A letter from Pan Chi.

272
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,520
Pan Chi...

273
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,480
You're still feeling jealous?

274
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
Seriously?

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,840
This is major!

276
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,760
It's concerning the incident of the Shens!

277
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,960
Look,

278
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,080
Pan Chi mentions that the granary's fire

279
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,040
involved the "Ignition Craft,"

280
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,880
Which suggests that the granary fire that

281
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
led to the conviction of the Shen Family,

282
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,160
was deliberately

283
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,520
ignited using Ignition Craft.

284
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,320
But the pattern on this jade pendant...

285
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,840
What's wrong?

286
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,880
This was from the wedding of

287
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,680
the late emperor and Her Majesty,

288
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,760
a pattern bestowed by the late emperor

289
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,600
to the Zhou Family.

290
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,600
The Zhou Family?

291
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
Is he implying that

292
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,120
the fire was set

293
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
by the Zhou Family?

294
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,040
[The one responsible for the deaths]

295
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,920
[of everyone in the Shen Family]

296
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,240
[has always been none other than]

297
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,800
[her, Zhou Xu.]

298
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,280
[The Zhou Family!]

299
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
That's a secret technique of the Fire Moth Sect.

300
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
How could it involve the Zhou Family?

301
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,840
Xing,

302
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
you should get some sleep now.

303
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,040
No!

304
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,680
I promised to help you

305
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,080
uncover the truth.

306
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,600
Now that we finally got

307
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,520
a lead,

308
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,560
how could it possibly be the Zhou Family?

309
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,120
Lord Shen,

310
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,080
here's a classified message from Gannan.

311
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,000
It contains the results

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,640
[of the autopsies of those]

313
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
[masked spectres in Gannan.]

314
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,680
[Those triangular puncture wounds]

315
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,600
[have been proved to be]

316
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,280
[a medium for a type of chronic poison]

317
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,280
[known as Ten-Day Grasp.]

318
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,920
[As the name suggests,]

319
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,320
[it means that after ten days of poisoning,]

320
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,280
[the King of Hell will collect the soul,]

321
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,320
[and the victim will succumb to the poison.]

322
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,760
Xing!

323
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,840
Xing.

324
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,160
The deceased have

325
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,520
triangular puncture wounds on their neck?

326
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,880
Yuan Niang...

327
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Yuan Niang too!

328
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,040
Shen Du, do you recall

329
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
the day of the Royal Advisor's memorial?

330
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,800
I was arrested by you and Lai Luozhi.

331
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,080
I was actually on the mountain

332
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,320
investigating Yuan's case.

333
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,240
It was concluded as a crime of passion,

334
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,080
but while I was

335
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,040
organizing the files,

336
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,880
I discovered

337
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,240
that Yuan also had

338
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,720
triangular puncture wounds.

339
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,960
This indicates that Yuan

340
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,040
very likely also fell victim to

341
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,120
the Ten-Day Grasp.

342
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Why would the Fire Moth Sect target her,

343
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,880
and even use a chronic toxin?

344
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,640
A common rural woman of the highlands

345
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,240
being targeted

346
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,400
and poisoned with a chronic toxin

347
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,080
only leaves one possibility:

348
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,600
she must have known

349
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,800
something she shouldn't have,

350
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,760
so needed to be silenced.

351
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,080
Look into it

352
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,760
to see if she has

353
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
any special identity

354
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
or other secrets.

355
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,640
Understood!

356
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,840
It seems that the granary

357
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,000
was indeed empty back then.

358
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
Using the Fire Moth Sect's Ignition Craft

359
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,720
to burn the granary

360
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,160
was to cover up the

361
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,720
fact that the granary was already empty.

362
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
This is likely

363
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,760
connected to Lai Luozhi.

364
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
And the Zhou Family...

365
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,680
Xing,

366
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,480
thank you!

367
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,840
It seems that

368
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,600
the forces behind the injustice done to my

369
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
Shen Family are deeply intertwined.

370
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,240
We should wait for the right moment.

371
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Xing,

372
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,800
no matter what,

373
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,600
I hope nothing bad happens to you.

374
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,080
Shen Du.

375
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,440
What time is it?

376
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,160
Don't worry,

377
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
today is a day off.

378
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,880
You were drunk last night.

379
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,040
Pan Chi's letter...

380
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,600
It's quite useful.

381
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,520
The intricate network

382
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,960
behind the Shen Family's incident

383
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,120
is on the verge of exposure.

384
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,200
Thank you, my love.

385
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,160
Yuan!

386
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,600
The Ten-Day Grasp!

387
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,000
Jing Lin went to investigate.

388
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,000
Not only was she a rural woman from

389
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,360
the nearby mountains, but she was also

390
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
tasked with cleaning the Ming Hall.

391
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,040
Ming Hall?

392
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,840
The Royal Advisor used to

393
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,400
live in the Ming Hall.

394
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,280
But ever since he passed away,

395
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
everyone related to the Ming Hall

396
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,200
has disappeared without a trace.

397
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,160
Could all of this

398
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,040
be tied to the Royal Advisor's death?

399
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,480
Is it possible that he...

400
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,840
After delivering

401
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
his final prophecy,

402
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,480
he passed away shortly thereafter.

403
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,280
I once heard rumors

404
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,360
that his last prophecy

405
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,840
"The phoenix leading nine chicks, peace in the world"

406
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,960
and there is an unknown

407
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,760
second half to it.

408
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
So it seems that

409
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
the Royal Advisor's death

410
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,440
might be quite suspicious.

411
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,360
Could it be that

412
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,800
the Royal Advisor's death and Yuan's death

413
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,280
and the disappearance of those

414
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,640
connected to the Ming Hall

415
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,040
are all linked to that prophecy?

416
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,800
[My lady,]

417
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,840
[there's a decree from the palace,]

418
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
[stating that Her Majesty]

419
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,160
[wants to see you alone in the palace.]

420
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,240
I'm going with you.

421
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,000
Her Majesty

422
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,440
wants me to go alone.

423
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,680
Alright, Uncle Zhong,

424
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,640
I heard you!

425
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,160
Please have the messenger wait a moment;

426
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,520
I will get changed and go right away.

427
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,160
Yes!

428
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,120
Wait for me.

429
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
Be cautious,

430
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,040
and don't be impulsive.

431
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,080
Also,

432
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
never bring up

433
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,480
Sun Tan

434
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,640
and anything related to Lai Luozhi.

435
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,920
Do not mention the Shen Family...

436
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,720
Alright,

437
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,040
I'll keep those in mind.

438
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,920
How did you get

439
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,360
so chatty all of a sudden?

440
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,800
Lady Xu,

441
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,360
this isn't the path to the study chamber.

442
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,760
You won't be going there today.

443
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,400
She's waiting for you in her sleeping chamber.

444
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,800
Her Majesty' sleeping chamber?

445
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,800
Your Royal Highness.

446
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,160
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

447
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,080
Please rise.

448
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,800
Emerald cake?

449
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,800
This is my

450
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,440
absolute favorite treat!

451
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,160
These days, my stomach can't handle much.

452
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,720
A half-piece would render me

453
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,360
unable to eat for the rest of the day,

454
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
a far cry from your youthful appetites.

455
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Have a taste.

456
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,320
Emerald cakes

457
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
are exceptionally rare.

458
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:57,960
They're crafted from the tribute

459
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,480
glutinous rice from the Western Regions,

460
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,160
dried and ground into fine powder,

461
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,040
combined with lotus leaf powder.

462
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,680
The filling is even more elaborate.

463
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,120
Her Majesty

464
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,800
rarely bestows this upon others.

465
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Why don't you give it a try

466
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,640
and see how it compares to others?

467
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,320
To my surprise, it's savory.

468
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,800
Whether it be pastries

469
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,800
or a person,

470
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,200
appearances can

471
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
be really

472
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,400
deceiving.

473
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,760
Aren't you the talkative one, huh?

474
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,680
Your Royal Highness.

475
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Your Royal Highness,

476
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
winter is just around the corner.

477
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,720
Please stay warm and avoid getting sick.

478
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,160
You all just

479
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,880
view me as aged.

480
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,000
Your Royal Highness

481
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
is the empire's guardian star.

482
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,360
The people yearn for

483
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,600
your eternal life, to ensure your

484
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,440
continued guidance and protection.

485
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,840
Yan Xing,

486
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,800
do you know why

487
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,680
I summoned you?

488
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,360
Your Royal Highness, I am unaware.

489
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,520
I seek clarity

490
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,840
on certain issues.

491
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,800
One of which is the rumor

492
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,080
that the

493
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,280
late governor of Yingzhou,

494
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,840
Mo Qianzhi,

495
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,520
alleged that I was

496
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,400
behind the Shen Family incident.

497
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,480
Shen Du's allegiance to

498
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Your Royal Highness is steadfast,

499
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,880
and I share that allegiance.

500
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,800
Stay calm,

501
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,400
rise and explain in detail.

502
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,560
Mo Qianzhi indeed made such claims,

503
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,960
but Shen Du has

504
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,800
served Your Royal Highness for so long.

505
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,960
He cannot be so easily misled.

506
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,640
Besides,

507
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,880
Mo Qianzhi was ensnared by

508
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
the deceit of wicked people,

509
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,040
leading him to embrace those claims.

510
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
Motivated by a desire to honor his mentor,

511
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
he was relentless in his pursuit of

512
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,080
the truth about the Shens' incident.

513
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,360
Unfortunately, he was misguided

514
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,400
and ended up as a

515
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,280
puppet for the Fire Moth Sect,

516
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,920
resulting in a huge mistake.

517
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,760
There's another issue.

518
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,760
They've been hidden in Yingzhou for years,

519
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,480
yet no whispers have escaped.

520
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,600
Could it be that they have

521
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,560
a presence elsewhere too?

522
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,040
Um...

523
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,960
There may well be such a presence,

524
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,520
but their

525
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,080
public identity is

526
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,400
unknown to us.

527
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,760
The Yingzhou incident serves as a precedent.

528
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,520
Mo Qianzhi met his end already,

529
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,760
might there not be

530
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,760
others like him to emerge?

531
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,840
Your Majesty is devoted to the people.

532
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,480
The people live in harmony and contentment.

533
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,000
There will surely not be more individuals

534
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,160
akin to Mo Qianzhi

535
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,000
appearing.

536
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,120
[Back in those days, I brought the]

537
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,520
[young emperor to attend court affairs,]

538
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
[which caused me countless accusations.]

539
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
How many truly understand

540
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,360
the helplessness I faced?

541
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,520
Everyone

542
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,720
wants to live a peaceful life.

543
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,480
But since we hold our positions,

544
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,760
we must shoulder the

545
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,320
responsibilities that come with them.

546
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,280
As the Empress Dowager,

547
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,920
I am well aware of the uncertain future.

548
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,160
But I have never given up.

549
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
With Qi (emperor) being so young,

550
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,680
as a woman in charge,

551
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,240
how many men would truly respect this?

552
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
But I will make them respect!

553
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,440
These years have been relatively stable.

554
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,280
I have not failed the late emperor's trust!

555
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,320
The grace of Your Royal Highness

556
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,320
is a shining example

557
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,760
for all the women of the empire.

558
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,640
And one more thing...

559
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,960
About the death of Sun Tan,

560
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,520
I know you were under pressure when you

561
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,480
submitted the petition to the palace.

562
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,440
But Sun Tan

563
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,760
still died under mysterious circumstances.

564
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,840
Do you believe

565
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,280
I am the one

566
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,880
allowing Lai Luozhi to act with impunity?

567
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,960
Your Royal Highness needs

568
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,160
to have Chancellor Lai oversee the officials.

569
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,760
It requires a display of great authority.

570
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
But I understand, no one is infallible;

571
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,760
who can be without faults?

572
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,280
If there are any complexities in the case,

573
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,760
I am willing to be a loyal subject

574
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,360
and speak candidly to correct any errors!

575
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,320
Excellent!

576
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,080
What a loyal and honest official!

577
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,840
Yan Xing's sharp and honest tongue

578
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,040
is something I cherish.

579
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,000
Do you know

580
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
that Lai Luozhi

581
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,440
visited me last night?

582
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
He spoke highly of your accomplishments.

583
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,160
He also told me to

584
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,360
make sure to put you to good use.

585
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,480
I am truly honored.

586
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,920
I have no connection with Lord Lai

587
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,800
and do not know

588
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
what Lord Lai's recommendation

589
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
entails.

590
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,400
I

591
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,880
do not seek any rewards or promotions.

592
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,800
I only wish to investigate cases,

593
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,080
to uncover the truth,

594
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,280
and bring justice to the deceased.

595
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,760
Alright, alright, you may rise.

596
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,720
How many times

597
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,200
have you knelt already?

598
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,040
Rise.

599
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,840
Come here.

600
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,080
Here,

601
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,960
take this.

602
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,440
Looking at you,

603
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,920
I am reminded of my younger days.

604
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,040
If you have some free time,

605
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,880
come to the palace more often

606
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,680
to chat with me.

607
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,400
Gratitude, Your Royal Highness.

608
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,319
Have you heard of Imperial Consort Shu?

609
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,279
The late emperor's

610
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,240
concubine from Nanlang?

611
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:44,799
I have heard a bit.

612
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,400
This was once the residence

613
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,799
bestowed to her by the late emperor.

614
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,440
There are rumors that she was killed

615
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,520
by the then-queen,

616
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,359
who is now the Empress Dowager,

617
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:57,960
in a struggle for favor.

618
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,720
In reality, she passed away

619
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,120
from longing for her homeland.

620
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,960
This palace

621
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,720
has added yet another tale of unfulfilled

622
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,160
heartbreak.

623
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,600
Now that you possess the

624
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,360
token to enter and exit the palace freely,

625
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,280
you should be able to grasp the depth

626
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,200
of the royal grace, which is as profound

627
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,320
as the sea, but also as heavy as a mountain.

628
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,120
I only feel anxious,

629
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,880
so please guide me, Lady Xu.

630
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,560
A few days ago, I helped you submit

631
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,800
Sun Tan's testimony.

632
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,920
Her Royal Highness did not respond.

633
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,160
But Lai Luozhi deliberately flattered you

634
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,920
with hidden intentions.

635
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,360
Today, Her Royal Highness

636
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,720
has specially invited you here

637
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,240
to give you a chance to speak.

638
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,200
You should understand

639
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,240
that Her Royal Highness

640
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,120
in this male-dominated world

641
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,400
must consider the voices of the subjects

642
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,240
while ensuring the loyalty of her officials.

643
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,360
I once believed that all matters

644
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
in this world are black and white.

645
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,080
But after all I've been through,

646
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
I've come to understand a bit more.

647
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,200
Her Majesty intends to show you favor

648
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,360
because she genuinely values you, for one,

649
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,440
and secondly,

650
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,960
it is also for Shen Du's sake.

651
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,880
You were married into the Shen Family

652
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,760
through the efforts of Lord Zhang.

653
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,760
Now,

654
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,720
Lai Luozhi also speaks highly of you,

655
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,960
which makes it hard not to suspect

656
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,000
whether you are maneuvering

657
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,840
between different factions.

658
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,800
Chief Clerk Yan Xing of the Ministry of Justice

659
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,040
offers my greetings to Lord Lai.

660
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,840
Having spent a long time with Shen Du,

661
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,440
your boldness

662
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,880
has certainly increased, Lady Yan.

663
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,440
I didn't get your point, Lord Lai.

664
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,720
Even the head of the Imperial Court

665
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,520
avoids this case,

666
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,280
yet Lady Yan dares to step forward

667
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
to take the lead.

668
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,560
It must be because you have

669
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,480
the support of the Imperial Guard, right?

670
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
And even those outlaws from the

671
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,520
Delinquents are also willing to help you.

672
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,160
Your clownish behavior does nothing

673
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,400
to alter the fact that the

674
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,480
Sun Tan' case

675
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,360
is irrelevant to me.

676
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,520
You should really grasp the situation.

677
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
Thank you for the reminder, Lord Lai.

678
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,360
I possess no extraordinary talents,

679
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,320
so apparently, my actions

680
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,240
are not always well-considered.

681
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,760
By the way,

682
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,960
your sister's actions are commendable.

683
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,960
She excels in literature and martial arts,

684
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,280
truly unparalleled.

685
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,640
That said,

686
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,680
the other day, my husband and I

687
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,720
were strolling through the streets of Yingzhou

688
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,040
and he mentioned

689
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,440
that he thought he saw your sister.

690
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
What are you talking about?

691
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,720
Recently, it has been quite chilly,

692
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,880
and my sister has been staying indoors.

693
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,240
A few days ago,

694
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,920
she was enjoying an outing

695
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,000
with the families of several officials.

696
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,520
How could she have been to Yingzhou?

697
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,520
My lady's accusations should

698
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,120
at least be backed by evidence, right?

699
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,480
If Shen Du is not guiding you properly,

700
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,280
you might as well come to my office.

701
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,360
I will certainly guide you

702
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,160
how to navigate these matters effectively.

703
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,240
Is that so?

704
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,120
Then I wish Lord Lai's sister

705
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,240
good health.

706
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,440
I'll humbly excuse myself now.

707
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,160
It just came to my mind that

708
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,760
Prince Xian is hosting a banquet

709
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,320
for officials during the Winter Solstice.

710
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,360
I assume the Shen residence

711
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,960
has received an invitation as well?

712
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,800
Lady Yan, we will

713
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,440
meet again at Prince Xian's residence

714
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,360
Shen Du!

715
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,120
I received words from the palace that

716
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,680
Lai Luozhi intercepted you on your way out.

717
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,000
I rushed over immediately.

718
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,960
He didn't harm you, did he?

719
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,440
Your ears are all red from the cold.

720
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,200
You often complain that the carriage

721
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,120
is slow, so why are you with one today?

722
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,120
It's cold out here,

723
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,520
and riding a horse would be chilling.

724
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,560
I never realized before

725
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,320
that you could be so thoughtful.

726
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,440
How did the meeting in the palace go?

727
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,920
Her Majesty' personal token?

728
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,000
Lady Xu reminded me of something:

729
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,000
"The depth of the royal grace, which is as"

730
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,600
"profound as the sea, but also as heavy as a mountain."

731
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,960
If I'm not mistaken, Her Majesty

732
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,360
has instructed my Imperial Guard to

733
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,240
keep an eye on the Imperial Inspectorate

734
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,600
and Lai Luozhi, while at the same time,

735
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,240
Lai Luozhi has also received orders

736
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,720
to monitor the Imperial Guard.

737
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,480
No wonder today

738
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,400
Lai Luozhi specifically

739
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,960
waited for me at the palace gate

740
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,360
and even praised me

741
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,600
in front of Her Majesty.

742
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,440
He probably figured it out too.

743
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,720
By the way,

744
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,840
at Prince Xian's feast,

745
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,680
do you think Lai Luozhi might

746
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,080
try to pull any underhanded tricks?

747
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,360
Ease your mind.

748
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,360
I'll definitely keep you safe.

749
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,760
Let's go.
