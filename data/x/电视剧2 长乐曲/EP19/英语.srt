3
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,360
Jing Lin!

4
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,840
Where is the doctor?

5
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,000
He's on his way to find the doctor.

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,760
It's raining cats and dogs.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,240
He must be held up on the road.

8
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
No.

9
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,480
He would

10
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
bleed to death.

11
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,400
Sir,

12
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,680
get me hot water and bandages.

13
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,280
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Usually, I use these tools

15
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,320
to tend

16
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,000
dead bodies.

17
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,200
There is no other choice now.

18
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
Please forgive me.

19
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,320
He's burning.

20
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,840
Sir,

21
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,400
go to see if

22
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Jing Lin is back.

23
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,400
Tell me once when he is.

24
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,960
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,150
You saved my life. Again.

26
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,400
Tears are useless.

27
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Totally!

28
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,080
Huo'e will not die for nothing.

29
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,760
Shen Du

30
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,120
will pay for it.

31
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,080
And Huo'e...

32
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,520
will return to the land of living!

33
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,000
Your Majesty,

34
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,640
Your Highness,

35
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,240
the news has spread

36
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
over Xiang'an that Lord Shen

37
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,880
was attacked

38
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,640
by Chen Huo'e in the street,

39
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,960
and is

40
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,760
severely injured.

41
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
I remember, Chancellor Lai

42
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,640
promised that

43
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,760
Chen Huo'e was already executed.

44
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,040
But how could a commander

45
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,920
be injured by a dead criminal

46
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,640
before the public?

47
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,320
More than a simple mistake

48
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
in criminal investigation system,

49
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,160
but a humiliation

50
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
for the empire!

51
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
Ma'am,

52
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,000
we all know that

53
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Mr Lai is devoted.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,160
Imperial Inspectorate too,

55
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,520
it has always been

56
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
representing the prestige

57
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,000
of our empire.

58
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,040
Mr Lai is known as

59
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,840
the Dark Demon.

60
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,680
And all criminals will succumb,

61
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
once they are caught by Mr Lai.

62
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,280
But Chen Huo'e has escaped

63
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
from the II several times.

64
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
It makes me wonder

65
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,760
whether it's caused by

66
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Mr Lai's negligence

67
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
or assistance.

68
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,160
Your Highness,

69
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,600
Chen Huo'e truly died

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,760
during the committal.

71
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,800
I already presented

72
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
dossier of the case and

73
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,600
her confession and belongings.

74
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,600
But I've heard that

75
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,600
although she's executed,

76
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,520
she can somehow return from the dead.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
Rumour has it that

78
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,120
one day,

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,440
she will be back.

80
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,200
Nonsense.

81
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,920
Lady Xu,

82
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,200
read the file.

83
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,040
Your Highness,

84
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,400
I, Shen Du, found out that Chen Huo'e

85
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,720
had situs inversus.

86
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
I already caught and beheaded her.

87
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,280
She will never come back again.

88
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,800
[Situs inversus.]

89
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
So,

90
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,960
she can escape

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
from dead so many times.

92
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,920
Mr Lai, you interrogated her yourself,

93
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
yet you didn't find out

94
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,080
her little secret.

95
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
I'm sorry to miss it.

96
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,680
Missed?

97
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
Or, you think

98
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,160
you can hide it from me?

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I would never!

100
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
I wouldn't hide

101
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,680
anything

102
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,200
from you, Your Highness.

103
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Well,

104
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,040
it's time we find another prestige

105
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
representation of the empire.

106
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,520
Although you didn't intentionally

107
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,600
make a mistake,

108
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,880
a criminal slipped through your fingers.

109
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,280
I'll dock a year's wage of yours,

110
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,990
and stop the circus you put out

111
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,200
every time

112
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
you go out.

113
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,230
Thank you for your mercy.

114
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,680
Lady Xu,

115
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,280
fetch the best court doctors

116
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,720
and medicines

117
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,840
for Mr Shen Du.

118
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
[Lai Luozhi made a serious mistake!]

120
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,120
Yet he just lost only a year's wage.

121
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,680
Mother is too

122
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
kind to him!

123
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,880
Your Highness, why didn't you

124
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,560
just express

125
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,040
your objection directly?

126
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,480
What did you say?

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Mr Zhang,

128
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Your Highness,

129
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
as a heinous criminal Chen Huo'e is,

130
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,240
mother knows what's the best.

131
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
We should not openly discuss

132
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,240
her decisions like this.

133
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,760
You are right.

134
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,320
It's so indiscreet of me.

135
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,520
Stop it, hypocrisy.

136
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,120
You lost a lot of blood

137
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,840
and had a high fever last night.

138
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,440
Wake up, please.

139
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,760
I haven't

140
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,440
cleared the name of your family.

141
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
What are you doing here?

142
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,680
If they caught you, you could be killed.

143
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,240
I promised to buy you

144
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
the fried rice ball.

145
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,480
I squashed some of them

146
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
when I got in,

147
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,640
but the taste is still the same.

148
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,280
Try it.

149
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't have any money, now.

150
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,920
Here, take this.

151
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,440
I don't want your money.

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
What do you think I am? A maid?

153
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
No. I just...

154
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
My father gave me this whistle as a gift.

155
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,520
Look,

156
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,920
my family name is carved in it.

157
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,160
I should go now,

158
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,680
or, they will get me.

159
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,840
Will you come back?

160
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,040
Definitely!

161
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Someday,

162
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,240
I will clear your name

163
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,560
and get you out.

164
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
The prison is a living hell,

165
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,280
yet you still clawed your way

166
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,400
out of there.

167
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,880
Today,

168
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,600
you can also extricate

169
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,800
yourself from illness.

170
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,000
[It's you.]

171
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
You can do it.

172
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,360
I believe that.

173
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,320
Even fell ill,

174
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,920
the Shen Du I know

175
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
would act like it's nothing

176
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,200
and put up nice clothes.

177
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,440
It may

178
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
facilitate his recovery.

179
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm so happy to know that.

180
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,280
I already stitched him up.

181
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,520
And he's lying here

182
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
just like other corpses

183
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
I examined before.

184
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,720
I've examined so many male bodies,

185
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm not afraid to change his clothes.

186
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,760
[He hides this rattan piggy]

187
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,040
[under his pillow.]

188
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,760
[The handwriting is beautiful.]

189
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
[It must be]

190
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,920
[written by]

191
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,480
[the girl in his heart.]

192
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Don't worry,

193
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,400
I'll not bother you with my feelings.

194
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,240
You saved my life,

195
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,760
and I take care of you.

196
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,320
We are even.

197
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,640
After the expiration of our agreement,

198
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,560
I'll leave you as we agreed.

199
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,440
What?

200
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,920
Agreement?

201
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,120
[You serious?]

202
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,080
Chuichui.

203
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,840
Xing.

204
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,040
Why are you here?

205
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,360
After all things happened,

206
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,640
how could I not?

207
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,960
This morning,

208
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
everybody says that

209
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,240
The White Death was

210
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,960
severely injured by Chen Huo'e,

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,960
and is going to die.

212
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,840
He did hurt pretty bad.

213
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,680
But...

214
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,720
But what?

215
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,040
You're killing me.

216
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,160
Xing,

217
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,280
what happened between you two?

218
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
Nothing.

219
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,680
Till now,

220
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,840
you're still holding out on me.

221
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,200
You aren't a real couple, are you?

222
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Chuichui, please keep it secret for me.

223
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,960
I didn't want to do it.

224
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,080
Did he threaten you?

225
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
It must be him!

226
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,720
In three months,

227
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,400
you'll be free

228
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,800
from this horrible den of his.

229
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,720
That's nice.

230
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,760
But,

231
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,840
he's still hurt.

232
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,920
What if by the time

233
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
the agreement ends, he is still in a coma.

234
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,080
Impossible.

235
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,480
He'll be fine by then.

236
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,560
But, if he wasn't,

237
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,160
what will you do?

238
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,440
Stay with him?

239
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,430
He was hurt

240
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,560
because of me!

241
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,670
I know.

242
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,240
But you should also

243
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,520
have your own life.

244
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,040
If...

245
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,910
he...

246
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,360
you know,

247
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,560
will you waste your life on a vegetable?

248
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,240
Bah.

249
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,880
Nonsense.

250
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,040
Spite the bad luck away, now!

251
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,600
Since you're a fake couple,

252
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,000
you really should

253
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,640
think for yourself from now on.

254
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,670
Look,

255
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,680
if you get back to your home

256
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,040
as an abandoned woman,

257
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,840
your father's wife

258
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,280
and your siblings

259
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,960
would make your life hell.

260
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,320
You and your mom

261
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,160
would be

262
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,840
maltreated by them.

263
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,080
I think you'd better

264
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,080
marry another good man.

265
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,680
C'mon,

266
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,000
what are you talking about?

267
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
The Ministry of Justice?

268
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
It seems that nobody

269
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
there is marriage material.

270
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,040
Jiang Langxing!

271
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,600
How about him?

272
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,400
Though he always

273
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,800
keeps

274
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,120
a straight face and boring

275
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,440
as a breathing tombstone,

276
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
[he's still a nice man.]

277
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,920
[Even cute, sometimes.]

278
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,720
[Choose him!]

279
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,280
You want me to marry Jiang Langxing?

280
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,320
Isn't he nice?

281
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,920
Alright.

282
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,680
Let me think about it.

283
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,880
Oh, yes!

284
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,360
A better choice!

285
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,480
Chief Inspector!

286
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,680
[Yes, he's]

287
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,400
[born humble,]

288
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,560
[but he's tall and strong,]

289
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,120
also generous.

290
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,840
If you couldn't be

291
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,480
Mrs. Shen,

292
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,120
it would be nice

293
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,880
to be his wife.

294
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,560
[He is kind.]

295
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,400
[But there is no]

296
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,680
that kind of flame between us.

297
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,640
Stop finding

298
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,720
a new husband for me.

299
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,600
You can always set off the right flame.

300
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,960
He will be

301
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
a great husband.

302
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,640
You can see it on his face.

303
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,120
Isn't it lovely?

304
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,000
Much better than

305
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,840
the White Death who's always

306
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,000
infuriate you.

307
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm injured,

308
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,280
not died.

309
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Shen Du,

310
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
you are awake!

311
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,960
Slow down.

312
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,840
Take it slow.

313
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,760
Lu Chuichui.

314
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
Stop meddling with our lives

315
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,000
at my place!

316
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,400
Get out!

317
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,080
Xing,

318
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
I'll be outside.

319
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,680
You...

320
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,600
Slow down.

321
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,520
You...

322
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,040
when did you wake up?

323
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,120
Just now.

324
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,680
Just now?

325
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,600
All of a sudden,

326
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
you woke out of...

327
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,760
Yes,

328
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,880
all of a sudden.

329
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

330
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,880
If it weren't for you,

331
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,640
I wouldn't have been killed

332
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,120
by Chen Huo'e.

333
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,320
Because of me, you've suffered so much.

334
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
It's not you who should be blamed,

335
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,760
but her.

336
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,480
Anyway, you treated

337
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
my injuries, remember?

338
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,120
Where is her body?

339
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,760
You're wounded badly back then,

340
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
Jing Lin and I were busy bringing you back.

341
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,840
Somebody seized the chance

342
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
to take that away.

343
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,280
Jing Lin has looked into it all night.

344
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,320
We believe that

345
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,000
the Imperial Inspectorate did it.

346
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,320
Lai Luozhi!

347
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,680
I believe that

348
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
Chen Huo'e was at large

349
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,760
for Lai Luozhi's neglect.

350
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
Then, his minions

351
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,680
stole

352
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,280
her body away.

353
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,040
He must be planning something.

354
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,560
Time for us to hunker down

355
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,960
in anticipation,

356
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,360
to see what they would do.

357
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
You should take some rest.

358
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,080
[Sir,]

359
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,000
[my husband has woken up.]

360
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,720
[Go get the doctor, please.]

361
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,040
[How fancy!]

362
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,960
[Thank God!]

363
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,120
[It's a miracle!]

364
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,320
[Hurry! Fetch the doctor!]

365
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,240
Xing.

366
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,160
Chuichui.

367
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,360
Finally, you're here.

368
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,280
What's wrong with

369
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
the servants in this mansion?

370
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm Mrs. Shen's friend,

371
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,480
yet they refuse to serve anything to me.

372
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,120
Miss Lu,

373
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,240
are you short on money?

374
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,720
I've developed an addiction

375
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,080
to the new play

376
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,560
staged in the Furong theater.

377
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,200
The actors are marvelous!

378
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,080
So, I spent

379
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,320
all my money there.

380
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,440
Now, my father refuses

381
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,640
to pay my bills,

382
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,560
and my salary is still on the way.

383
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,120
So...

384
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,280
You're my best friend,

385
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
can you invite me for lunch?

386
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,880
Mr Shen!

387
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,520
[Yes, ma'am.]

388
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,520
What can I do for you?

389
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Prepare some food

390
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,720
for Chuichui

391
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,040
and Yun Que.

392
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,560
And, pack some of them for me,

393
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
the master and I will eat in his bedroom.

394
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,360
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,520
Yan Xing,

396
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,800
we haven't eaten together for ages.

397
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,680
Can't you stay?

398
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,200
Shen Du is confined to bed.

399
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,760
He needs to be taken care of.

400
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,320
He has so many servants.

401
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,160
He doesn't need you as I do.

402
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,920
Yun Que,

403
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,840
you said yourself,

404
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
that you want to marry the Whit...

405
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,080
Shen Du.

406
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,760
He's in pain.

407
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,840
Why don't you go look after him?

408
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,080
Why are you staying here, with me?

409
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,200
I just give up.

410
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,320
Give up?

411
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
She gives up!

412
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,880
You finally believe the White Death

413
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
will never be a good husband?

414
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,720
After all these fusses,

415
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,360
I figured that

416
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,560
Yan Xing,

417
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,120
you don't love him, why would you

418
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,920
waste the rest of your life here?

419
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,040
Exactly!

420
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,520
You are

421
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
in Shen Du's mansion,

422
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,600
keep it down!

423
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,120
Ma'am,

424
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,920
the lunch box you asked for.

425
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,400
Guards!

426
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes, master.

427
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,240
Tell all our men,

428
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,080
since the game begins,

429
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,480
let's give them

430
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
more fun, shall we?

431
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Right?

432
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Believe me,

433
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,280
he's gorgeous!

434
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,600
Yes, he is.

435
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,120
I'd never thought

436
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,240
you can become so close

437
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,080
after a simple meal.

438
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Yun Que and I

439
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
hit it off. She's like

440
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,560
the sister I never had.

441
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,560
We both agree that only girls

442
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,600
would truly understand each other.

443
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,560
We should never let others

444
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,120
decide our future.

445
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,880
That's right.

446
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,600
We should

447
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,960
figure it out on ourselves.

448
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,720
So,

449
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,080
we are inviting you

450
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,040
to Mingsheng Temple with us,

451
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,960
asking gods' blessing

452
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,920
on our marriage, three days later.

453
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,960
Mingsheng Temple?

454
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
Marriage?

455
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,120
You wouldn't be Mrs. Shen

456
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,800
forever, would you?

457
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,840
Although I give up

458
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,960
on Shen Du,

459
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,880
you are not

460
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,640
close with him.

461
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
You agreed to leave him in three months, right?

462
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Yeah, right.

463
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,560
Then, why are you hesitating?

464
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,200
You are not

465
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,560
in love with the White Death, are you?

466
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,040
I will leave him

467
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,960
when the time comes.

468
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,080
But I want to build a career.

469
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,160
So, marriage is not in my plan for my future.

470
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,040
You can always have a career and a husband.

471
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,160
Yes.

472
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,560
Three days later,

473
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,080
we'll go to Mingsheng Temple,

474
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,160
asking for gods' blessing nonetheless.

475
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Hear, hear.

476
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,240
Oh, and,

477
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,200
Newly-made candied fruits

478
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,560
are piling up at my home.

479
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,480
I can't have them all.

480
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,440
Do you want to have a bite?

481
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,600
Yes, please!

482
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,480
Let's go.

483
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,160
Bye.

484
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,280
Don't miss me.

485
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,520
Looking forward to your little trip?

486
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Should I give you a hand?

487
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,440
What?

488
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,600
Should I pick something out for you?

489
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,120
Right,

490
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,480
you are still healing.

491
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,720
I shouldn't leave you alone at home.

492
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll get someone

493
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,640
to send those dresses

494
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
to Chuichui,

495
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,880
let her make her own decision.

496
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,160
I'll not go with her.

497
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,040
You're doing this for Lu Chuichui?

498
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Yeah.

499
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,960
She'll stay with us for a couple of days.

500
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,080
But

501
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,800
my dresses are

502
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,880
all so plain.

503
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,960
She wouldn't like them.

504
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,880
You should go have fun with your friends.

505
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,680
Don't worry about me, darling.

506
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,160
Our servants will take good care of me.

507
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,640
And, three days later,

508
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,320
I'll be healthy enough

509
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
to go with you.

510
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,040
No. Please don't.

511
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,320
You hurt badly,

512
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
need to have a lot of rest.

513
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,840
Go back to sleep.

514
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,280
I really spend

515
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,600
too much time in the theater.

516
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,200
Why did I doze off?

517
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,240
It must be

518
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,720
the play's fault. I was lost in the story

519
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,480
and

520
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,320
I...

521
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,960
It's alright.

522
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,440
I'll be fine.

523
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,160
Today is

524
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,440
such a good day!

525
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,480
The sun is so bright!

526
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,880
I'm doomed.

527
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,920
You're alive or dead?

528
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,360
Dead.

529
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,080
Why are you afraid of ghosts?

530
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,960
Ghosts were ordinary people.

531
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,480
Though you said so, I'm still terrified.

532
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,760
I'm so scared!

533
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,080
I did nothing wrong to you.

534
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,880
Go find the one who hurt you, please.

535
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,280
Go away, please.

536
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,720
I'm begging you.

537
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,920
You seemed to be

538
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,080
braver when

539
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,640
we were in the cemetery.

540
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,600
Oh, it's you.

541
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,640
Maskman,

542
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,000
it's strange.

543
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,160
I was horrified moments ago.

544
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,400
But once I know

545
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,920
you're with me,

546
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm not afraid anymore.

547
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,520
Maybe because

548
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,320
the ghosts also loathe me and go away.

549
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,480
Why abase yourself?

550
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,120
Just stating the fact.

551
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,320
I'm

552
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,760
abominated by everything

553
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,080
in the world,

554
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,320
no matter if they're alive or dead.

555
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,280
Nonsense.

556
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,400
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

557
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,400
You're a nice man.

558
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,720
Believe me,

559
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,040
fairies that

560
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,480
couldn't be seen

561
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,040
by mortal eyes

562
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,160
are keen to be your friends.

563
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,680
I'll show you.

564
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,160
Just look.

565
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,160
Oh, dear fairy,

566
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,120
will you befriend

567
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,280
with maskman?

568
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,520
If you will,

569
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,960
please transfer yourself

570
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,200
from this bowl

571
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,080
to this bowl.

572
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,080
Oh, you want to hear

573
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,320
maskman invite you in person?

574
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,240
So, maskman,

575
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,040
please invite

576
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,920
the fairy.

577
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,160
Please join us, dear fairy.

578
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,160
See?

579
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,560
It agrees.

580
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,680
Since fairies

581
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,640
love you

582
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,960
and want to play with you,

583
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,960
you must be the most lovable person.

584
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,200
Everybody loves you.

585
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,790
It's alright.

586
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,790
Don't be sad.

587
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,920
You're the most lovable boy in the world.

588
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,310
Everybody loves you.

589
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,400
They must love you.

590
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,600
You're right.

591
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,560
Fairy,

592
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,560
since you're also

593
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,600
Lu Chuichui's friend,

594
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,760
can you do me a favour?

595
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,600
It agrees.

596
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,200
What?

597
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,080
It's scary?

598
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,520
You are

599
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,880
such an odd creature.

600
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,840
Unflappable in a late-night cemetery, yet

601
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,680
so easy to be frightened by small things.

602
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,800
Yet, you showed no fear

603
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,720
to my ugly musk.

604
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,800
Because there's nothing to be afraid of.

605
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,560
The cemetery is the resting place of

606
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,840
my dearest mother.

607
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,640
And you...

608
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,440
you're wearing a mask

609
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,320
to cover your birthmark.

610
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
Why should I be afraid of that?

611
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,160
Oh, right!

612
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,280
I heard that

613
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,280
golden rings

614
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,840
could not remove

615
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,520
one's birthmark.

616
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,160
You should stop using it.

617
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,360
It would be a pity

618
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,280
if the ring cut your face.

619
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,680
Why?

620
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,400
Are you taking your ring back?

621
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,840
No, you keep it.

622
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,000
If I can't get rid of those marks,

623
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,480
I'll never get the nerve to

624
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,560
take off my mask in front of you.

625
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,760
Don't be.

626
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,600
It's not your fault.

627
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,240
Besides, one's character

628
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,000
is never determined

629
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
by one's appearance.

630
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,320
I believe

631
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,680
our appearance is

632
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,200
like

633
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
makeup

634
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,400
of actors and actresses.

635
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,480
It's only a small part of the character.

636
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,760
Then, what do you think of me?

637
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,600
Am I virtuous?

638
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,320
Am I evil?

639
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
Good or bad?

640
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,920
I'll tell you

641
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,760
when you take off

642
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,680
your mask.

643
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,720
What if

644
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,680
you lose interest

645
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,760
in my appearance,

646
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,040
what should I do?

647
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,840
Don't worry.

648
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,720
I gave you the ring in hopes of

649
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,960
helping you remove your birthmark.

650
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,520
But, I don't care

651
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,840
if you can remove it or not.

652
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Because either way, I already

653
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,800
look you as a dear friend of mine.

654
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,840
I would never judge a book by its cover.

655
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,440
Just, take it off.

656
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,040
I will.

657
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,360
Lai Luozhi...

658
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,080
Lu Chuichui.

659
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,800
Today,

660
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,960
I revealed my secret to you.

661
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,560
Whether you're frightened or not,

662
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,920
please keep it for me.

663
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
Don't tell it

664
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,000
to another soul.

665
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,760
Hope you can

666
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
keep your promise.

667
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,400
I believe you.

668
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,160
What are you thinking?

669
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,200
Nothing.

670
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,760
Well,

671
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,840
look,

672
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,280
there are so many people here

673
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:24,960
all asking for

674
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,320
a perfect marriage.

675
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,920
You're here.

676
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,000
What a coincidence!

677
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,400
You're also here for a suitable match?

678
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,480
Why?

679
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,000
You don't think

680
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,440
you are the only ones who need it.

681
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,440
And people like us

682
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,800
shouldn't require a happy marriage?

683
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,280
Of course not.

684
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,760
I'm just saying,

685
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,120
how fascinating

686
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,920
fate works.

687
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,080
Right, Xing?

688
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,320
Stop it.

689
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,720
Let's go.

690
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,720
Where to?

691
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,560
Like you said, asking gods' blessing.

692
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,280
Askin...

693
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,160
Really?!

694
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,960
You're also in want of a wife!

695
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,080
Who'd thought it!

696
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,800
Alright.

697
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,480
You are old enough

698
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,600
to take interest

699
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,800
in girls, not books.

700
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,560
I'll go with you!

701
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,600
Since you're interested, I'll do it

702
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,120
Xing,

703
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,560
you go talk with the general,

704
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,000
I'll be back soon.

705
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,680
Let's go.

706
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,240
I believe you rarely

707
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,640
visit this temple.

708
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,000
Would you like to join me?

709
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,840
Have fun.

710
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,520
Leave me alone.

711
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,400
[Shen Du,]

712
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,520
[you must drink it up.]

713
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,760
[Visiting the Temple for a new marriage?]

714
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,200
Jing Lin.

715
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,120
Yes, sir.

716
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,320
Xiangren.

717
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,040
What are you trying to say?

718
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,560
Xing,

719
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,240
I overheard Lu Chuichui

720
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,640
discussing your marriage.

721
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,800
[That's insane.]

722
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,720
[How can a woman request a divorce?]

723
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,200
[Why not?]

724
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,840
The law says that

725
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,560
divorce due to

726
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,680
disharmony

727
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,160
does not require

728
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,120
punishment.

729
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,800
Besides,

730
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,360
they've never...

731
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,560
slept together.

732
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,760
They agreed to separate long ago.

733
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,880
[Anyhow,]

734
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,640
[I already told her]

735
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,320
to find another one.

736
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,880
But, it's a shame

737
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,200
that there is no suitable man

738
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,480
from your place

739
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,960
and the Minstry of Justice.

740
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,240
except for General Xu.

741
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,720
Some day, I swear

742
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,400
I'll shut Lu Chuichui up for good.
