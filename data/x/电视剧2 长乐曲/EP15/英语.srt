00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:14,960
[English subtitles are available]

00:01:42,160 --> 00:02:02,800
[Melody of Golden Age]
[EP15]

3
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
[Lord Zhang has arrived.]

4
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Stand still, don't move.

5
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,320
[Hold on.]

6
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,600
Stop!

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,480
Let go of him!

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,360
Are you abducting people

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
in broad daylight?

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,920
[This isn't an abduction.]

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
I sent them

12
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,280
to invite him over as a guest.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Your Highness,

14
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
since he is a guest,

15
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,240
he should be free to come and go.

16
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,960
[This gentleman clearly]

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,360
[doesn't want to be your guest.]

18
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,480
Such a trivial matter

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,360
has roused Lord Zhang's interest.

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,920
I wonder what the relationship is between

21
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
you two.

22
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,800
Apologies, Your Highness.

23
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,520
[I was by imperial decree to visit]

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,680
Lord Shen and his wife.

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,960
In a fortunate coincidence,

26
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
Lady Yan mentioned this to me.

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
[Her Majesty has always valued Your Highness,]

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
[and my actions are also]

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,320
[for Your Highness' sake.]

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
I implore Your Highness to think it over.

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,680
Since you said so,

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,440
I won't insist on keeping him.

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
I shall take my leave.

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,000
Lady Yan!

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
[I have already made it clear last time.]

36
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,360
[You can protect him for a moment,]

37
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,680
[but can you protect him for a lifetime?]

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,760
Lord Shen,

39
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
we've received a report stating

40
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,840
that in the ruins of the Jinxiu Workshop,

41
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,400
several pieces of moth-shaped

42
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
jade have suddenly appeared.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,080
[And some deceased figure has reappeared,]

44
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,000
[which is quite eerie.]

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Let's go!

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,920
To the Jinxiu Workshop.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,760
[It's the owner of the shop, Lady Kong!]

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,240
[Isn't she already dead?]

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
[Is that her or a specter?]

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,960
[Can the dead truly come back?]

51
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,040
As you saw,

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,680
could it be that a ghost is truly at work?

53
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,600
[I never believe]

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
[that there are ghosts in this world.]

55
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,000
If there are,

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,480
it's likely that someone is secretly causing mischief.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
We should investigate thoroughly,

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,760
and we will surely find clues.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,720
[I found it!]

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,440
A miracle has revealed the jade!

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
This moth-shaped jade must be divine!

62
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
There must be more, find them!

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
There are more for sure, look for them!

64
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
I found one!

65
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,280
Amazing!

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,120
[I found another one!]

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,000
I always feel that

68
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
behind this case,

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,280
there are two pairs of hands.

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
One pair of them

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
wants to quietly erase

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,200
this case.

73
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,160
And the other pair

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,040
is stirring up trouble.

75
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,040
Moth-shaped jade.

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,200
The owner manifested.

77
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,280
The dead come back to life.

78
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,840
All these strange occurrences

79
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
seem to have been arranged.

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,640
They all emerged collectively this month.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,400
[Stirring up such a storm in]

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
[the imperial capital is beyond the]

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,840
capabilities of a

84
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,800
mere habitual murderer

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,640
or an ordinary sorcerer.

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,760
Some significant figure must be behind it.

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,720
But I can't figure out

88
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
what this significant figure's

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,960
purpose is.

90
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,240
Creating a deity.

91
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,000
Creating a deity?

92
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
The situation

93
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
is far too complicated

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,760
for you alone to grasp.

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,480
There are cases within cases,

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,320
and they are intricately linked

97
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,960
to the power struggles among the higher-ups.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,880
What is him trying to achieve

99
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,200
by creating a deity?

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
What's your take in this?

101
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,080
My only thought right now

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
is also my only advice to you:

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,880
Stop investigating.

104
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
Boring.

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,000
I thought

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,760
you had some profound insights.

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240
I must

109
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,000
continue the investigation.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
That's so naive.

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,400
Don't recklessly

112
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,480
put yourself in danger.

113
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,920
Are you

114
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,000
concerned about me?

115
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,560
What do you think?

116
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,480
In any case,

117
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
you are currently bearing

118
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,840
the title of the wife of Lord Shen.

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,920
Be more prudent.

120
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,480
Don't let yourself

121
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
get involved in this.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,520
I feel that you actually care about me.

123
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
You wouldn't allow me.

124
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,040
But I'm determined to

125
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,400
get to the bottom of this.

126
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,880
My lady!

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,920
Lu Chuichui and I are planning to go

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
to the silk shop in the south of the city.

129
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,760
They received a new batch of fabrics,

130
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
including madder red,

131
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,760
safflower yellow,

132
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,440
hazel black,

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,240
and locust bean yellow.

134
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
The tie-dyeing looks gorgeous.

135
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,680
If I get there late, there won't be any.

136
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,200
Why don't you head inside.

137
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,600
Let's not wake Lord Shen.

138
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
He didn't sleep well last night.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
Let him sleep a bit more.

140
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,440
Let him sleep a bit more.

141
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,800
Please be on your way.

142
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
Morning, my lady.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Where are you going?

144
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,160
Lu Chuichui and I are planning to go

145
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,920
to the silk shop in the south of the city.

146
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,320
We're checking out a new batch of fabrics,

147
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,520
including madder red,

148
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,200
[safflower yellow,]

149
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,840
[hazel black,]

150
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,480
[and locust bean yellow.]

151
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
The tie-dyeing looks gorgeous.

152
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,680
If I get there late, there won't be any.

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm going to a silk shop

154
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,120
in the south of the city.

155
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,360
They received a new batch of fabrics...

156
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,720
Zhong,

157
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,240
what's wrong with my lady?

158
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Safflower yellow,

159
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,240
hazel black,

160
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,560
and locust bean yellow.

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Did they have a quarrel again?

162
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,480
If I get there late, there won't be any.

163
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,360
Would you like a sugar-filled bread?

165
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,240
They are freshly made.

166
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,840
I was about to send some to Lord Shen.

167
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,040
Wait a minute.

168
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,960
That was a fabricated lie.

169
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
What?

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,360
[Lady Yan seems to be in a hurry,]

171
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
[leaving so early in the morning.]

172
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
[She must have some urgent business.]

173
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
[I noticed that Lord Shen hasn't had]

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,920
[much appetite for breakfast lately,]

175
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,160
so I made some sugar-filled breads.

176
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,320
You should try some as well.

177
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,920
[Jing Lin.]

178
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,280
Lord Shen.

179
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,440
Keep an eye on Yan Xing.

180
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,800
Given her nature,

181
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,840
she's sure to ignore my advice.

182
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:06,800
My lord.

183
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,400
[During the investigation,]

184
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,480
[one witness was overlooked,]

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
[about the witnesses]

186
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,040
[who found the corpse,]

187
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
[besides Chen Shoujie,]

188
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,840
[there was another one.]

189
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
[...cooking herself.]

190
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,640
[She made mutton and smoked chicken.]

191
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,400
[She also baked flatbreads and stuffed breads.]

192
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,360
[She even rewarded me with a bowl of wine.]

193
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,480
[My lady was so good to us.]

194
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,200
[She was cooking herself that night.]

195
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,280
[She made mutton and smoked chicken.]

196
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
[She also baked flatbreads and stuffed breads.]

197
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,280
[That servant of Chen Shoujie's...]

198
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,680
[His testimony was exactly the same]

199
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,320
[as what the officials recorded]

200
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
[when they questioned him.]

201
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,280
[The testimonies are even word for word.]

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,960
[I'm afraid he memorized it long ago,]

203
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
[and knew exactly what to say.]

204
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,240
Chen Shoujie,

205
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,880
where is your servant?

206
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,040
Fire moth, fire moth.

207
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Fire moth.

208
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
Fire moth, fire moth.

209
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Fire moth.

210
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,840
Fire moth!

211
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,440
What fire moth?

212
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,960
Fire moth, fire moth, fire moth!

213
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Fire moth!

214
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,080
Fire moth!

215
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,360
Fire moth!

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,200
You!

217
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,800
On the day Lady Chen was murdered,

218
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,000
what exactly did you see?

219
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,920
Why did you fabricate your testimony?

220
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,640
Why does it seem like he's waiting for me?

221
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,080
Mingsheng Temple?

222
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,920
Sounds somewhat familiar.

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,360
Excuse me,

224
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,920
did you just see

225
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,160
anyone come in?

226
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,920
Excuse me...

227
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,120
Help...

228
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,560
Resurrected from the dead...

229
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
Resurrected from the dead...

230
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,520
Resurrected from...

231
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Don't die just yet.

232
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,640
You still haven't revealed

233
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,760
who the murderer is.

234
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,160
- You can't die!
- Who are you?

235
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,800
And who are you?

236
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
Why did you commit murder?

237
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,000
It wasn't me.

238
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

239
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,800
Are you still trying to deny it?

240
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,280
I truly didn't kill him.

241
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,000
Someone!

242
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,680
I didn't kill anyone!

243
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,200
I just...

244
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,880
Stop!

245
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,760
Greetings, Your Highness!

246
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
Your Highness...Princess Runing?

247
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,120
Mingsheng Temple.

248
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
No wonder that name sounds so familiar.

249
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,080
The Jinxiu Workshop incident

250
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,680
actually involves her, and she's

251
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,160
currently reflecting at Mingsheng Temple.

252
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,560
Mr. Xu!

253
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,680
What's the matter?

254
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,080
Do you not value your head anymore,

255
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,480
or are you willing to lose your hands?

256
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,160
Why am I so foolish?

257
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,800
I was set up

258
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,080
and fell into a trap.

259
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,080
I really am too foolish.

260
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
What's going on?

261
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
The powder...

262
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,600
must be what I picked up

263
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
at Mingsheng Temple.

264
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,680
It looks just like

265
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,080
the suspicious powder

266
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,120
found around the Jinxiu Workshop.

267
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,480
I need to gather my thoughts.

268
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
There must be a connection in all of this.

269
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm sure there's something

270
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I've missed.

271
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,440
Ease your mind.

272
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,560
There's someone who is even

273
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
more anxious than you.

274
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
I followed her closely,

275
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,840
but my horse seemed

276
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
to have been spooked when it

277
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,160
reached the outskirts of Chen residence.

278
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,560
By the time I arrived

279
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,600
at Mingsheng Temple,

280
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,920
Princess Runing had already...

281
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,520
Are you certain that after leaving

282
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,600
Chen residence, she was acting strangely?

283
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,040
Yes.

284
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,000
I called out to my lady several times,

285
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,920
but she didn't respond at all.

286
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,960
It was as if she was possessed,

287
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,200
chasing after something.

288
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,280
Whoever it is,

289
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,280
if they dare to target

290
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,400
my woman,

291
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,880
prepare to face my wrath!

292
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,600
But my lady was taken

293
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,800
by Princess Runing.

294
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
The water might be deeper than we thought.

295
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,600
There are rules in place.

296
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,520
You are not allowed to enter.

297
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,360
How could Yan Xing possibly commit murder?

298
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,000
You really can't go in.

299
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,440
How's she doing?

300
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,920
She's fine.

301
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,280
She just ate two buns a moment ago.

302
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
[By the way,]

303
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,320
she specifically asked

304
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,520
not to inform her family

305
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,560
about this for now.

306
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
Who could have schemed against

307
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,800
Yan Xing?

308
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Please, you must uncover the truth!

309
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,640
We also believe

310
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,120
that Yan Xing is not capable of murder.

311
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,440
However, the one who took her

312
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,760
was Princess Runing.

313
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,080
The investigation of this whole thing,

314
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,840
might not be easy to conduct.

315
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,640
What's so complicated about it?

316
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,400
There are witnesses and solid evidence.

317
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,360
Killing someone warrants a death penalty,

318
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,360
and that's only just.

319
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,560
Hey!

320
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,640
Lord Lai,

321
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,640
what brings you to the prison

322
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
at this late hour?

323
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,520
About the incident at Mingsheng Temple,

324
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,400
it involves a royal princess.

325
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
Her Majesty wishes to interrogate

326
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,560
the suspect, Yan Xing.

327
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,800
What are you waiting for?

328
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,040
Take her.

329
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,720
My lord!

330
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,840
Not so fast!

331
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,880
Lord Shen, what is the meaning of this?

332
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,720
Are you intending to shield your wife,

333
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,080
obstruct the interrogation,

334
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
and bend the law?

335
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
Are you here on the

336
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,000
order of Her Majesty,

337
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,600
or are you relying on favor and privilege

338
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,240
to disregard the law?

339
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,560
The Imperial Inspectorate has always been

340
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,520
dedicated to serving Her Majesty.

341
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,080
Lord Shen,

342
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
are you insinuating something about me?

343
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,760
Regarding today's events,

344
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,080
I must take charge personally

345
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
to uphold the trust placed in me

346
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,120
by Her Majesty.

347
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,000
I guarantee a thorough investigation.

348
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,800
Lord Lai,

349
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,480
you may leave now.

350
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,320
Keep a vigilant watch here.

351
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,120
If anyone dares to approach,

352
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,480
consider it a prison break.

353
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Execute without mercy.

354
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,480
Understood.

355
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,840
I didn't expect

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,720
Lord Shen to be so firmly convinced

357
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
that Lady Yan is innocent.

358
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,320
But I wonder, when Her Majesty

359
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,160
learns of this tomorrow,

360
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,520
will she be swayed

361
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,480
by your deep affection as a couple,

362
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,400
or will she order me to enforce justice?

363
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,600
I advise you,

364
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,680
Lord Shen,

365
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
to savor this night

366
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
of intimacy.

367
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,160
Let's go.

368
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
We shall return tomorrow.

369
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
What do you want

370
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,560
- at this late hour?
- Lord Wu.

371
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,560
No more words.

372
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,240
Just follow me.

373
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,760
Can't this wait until tomorrow?

374
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,160
Greetings, Lord Shen.

375
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Jing Lin!

376
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,120
You witnessed it firsthand that day,

377
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,880
after Yan Xing left Chen residence,

378
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
she seemed to be chasing someone and rode

379
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,240
all the way to the woods west of the city.

380
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,040
That's correct.

381
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,840
Yan Xing mentioned

382
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
that she discovered a servant

383
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
from the Chen Family had forged testimony,

384
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,000
and out of suspicion, she went there.

385
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,720
She found he was attempting to escape,

386
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
so she chased him to Mingsheng Temple.

387
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,360
That's right.

388
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,680
Yan Xing said that.

389
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,520
Then something doesn't add up.

390
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,360
What doesn't add up?

391
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,880
Jing Lin!

392
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,920
Lift your foot.

393
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,640
So that's how it is.

394
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,480
The ground in the woods is quite muddy.

395
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
If he was riding a fast horse,

396
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
the cuffs of his pants wouldn't be so clean.

397
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,000
I should have gotten my shoes dirty

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,880
while following my lady

399
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,680
to Mingsheng Temple.

400
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
But the servant's shoes

401
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,320
are completely spotless.

402
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,840
Then how could the corpse

403
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,320
have appeared at Mingsheng Temple?

404
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,200
This smell...

405
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,240
Could it be?

406
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,800
There are numerous doubts

407
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
in this case.

408
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,120
No one is to interrogate

409
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,280
the suspect before tomorrow.

410
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,560
Yet, if...

411
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,520
Yan Xing comes to

412
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,920
any harm in here,

413
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,360
you will be held accountable.

414
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,640
Lord Shen,

415
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,400
where should we start?

416
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,240
To the source of this incident.

417
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,760
This powder closely resembles

418
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,120
what we found at the Jinxiu Workshop.

419
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,240
Could it be that

420
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,160
my lady fell into

421
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,080
the trap here?

422
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,400
[Fire moth, fire moth, fire moth!]

423
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
Something was originally stored here.

424
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720
Lord Shen,

425
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,720
It appears there are no

426
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,160
signs of a struggle or search here.

427
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,000
So much blood!

428
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,360
It seems this is

429
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,000
the scene of the crime.

430
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,040
But how did the corpse

431
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,000
end up at Mingsheng Temple?

432
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,560
[It's a chest.]

433
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,160
Lord Shen, this shows

434
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,640
Prince Xian's whereabouts last night.

435
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,960
As expected.

436
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,560
You had someone

437
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,880
spy on Prince Xian.

438
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,360
If they find out,

439
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,000
- it could lead to...
- Her safety is paramount.

440
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,600
It seems I need to meet

441
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
Princess Runing myself.

442
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,000
Greetings, Your Highness,

443
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm Shen Du, the commander of the Imperial Guard.

444
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,840
Lord Shen,

445
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,960
you are the renowned White Death.

446
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,880
Are you here

447
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,120
to arrest anyone today?

448
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,160
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

449
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,080
I'm here humbly asking for a favor.

450
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,800
Lord Shen is being humorous.

451
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,600
I have been stripped of my royal title.

452
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,920
I am simply a civilian now.

453
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,160
What could you possibly want from me?

454
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,680
Please, take your leave.

455
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,720
I implore Your Highness

456
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,280
to consider my request.

457
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,040
If it pertains to court matters,

458
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,080
it no longer concerns me.

459
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,400
You needn't elaborate further.

460
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,960
This is a personal matter of mine.

461
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,520
A personal matter?

462
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,600
Yesterday, my wife was set up

463
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,000
and mistakenly entered Mingsheng Temple.

464
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,840
Now she has been confined in prison.

465
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,000
I beg Your Highness to show mercy.

466
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,520
You would actually come to me

467
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
to plead for your wife?

468
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,120
This is quite different from

469
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,680
the rumors about White Death.

470
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,480
Are you asking me

471
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
to let her off the hook?

472
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
I want Your Highness to share the truth.

473
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,680
What do you mean?

474
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,240
Are you implying that I slandered

475
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,280
your wife?

476
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,360
Your Highness would never intend to do so.

477
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,760
But if you wish to protect someone,

478
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,400
you might conceal certain information.

479
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,480
That's absurd!

480
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
I'm tired.

481
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,640
You may leave now.

482
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,040
At the time of the incident, was

483
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,560
Your Highness truly the only one in here?

484
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,560
[Were there no others present?]

485
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
The Empress Dowager has confined Your Highness.

486
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,240
If she knew you met Prince Xian in secret,

487
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,800
I wonder what her thoughts would be.

488
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,440
Are you threatening me?

489
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,280
I only seek the truth.

490
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,120
He was simply

491
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
concerned about his aunt living alone,

492
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
in a state of loneliness.

493
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,600
He brought me some gifts,

494
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,880
and shared some tea. That's all.

495
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,360
There was no discussion of state affairs,

496
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,760
and no hidden agenda.

497
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,040
This was merely

498
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,000
a matter of familial courtesy.

499
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,080
Is it really against the law?

500
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,240
The prince values family ties.

501
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,320
But others

502
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,560
may not see it that way.

503
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,320
Sometimes,

504
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,720
a single word

505
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,480
can lead to an innocent person's demise.

506
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,080
I beg Your Highness to reveal the truth

507
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,520
and clear my wife's name.

508
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,360
Open it.

509
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,760
I must admit, I did not

510
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
witness your wife committing murder.

511
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
When I arrived,

512
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,240
the main hall

513
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,120
only had her and the body remaining.

514
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,480
I didn't want anyone to know

515
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
that the prince had been here,

516
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,680
so I asked them to leave

517
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,000
through the back door.

518
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,800
Later, when inspecting the back door,

519
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,720
we indeed found

520
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
signs of a break-in.

521
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,240
Among the items

522
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,200
the prince brought,

523
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,440
I discovered this chest,

524
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
but I don't know its origin.

525
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,800
Gratitude, for revealing the truth.

526
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
I apologize for my discourtesy today.

527
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,680
Lord Shen, act wisely.

528
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,280
Should the prince suffer any harm,

529
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,240
I'll not hesitate to inform Her Majesty

530
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,640
about your spying on the royal family.

531
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,240
Do Your Highness truly believe

532
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,640
I would be so audacious

533
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,200
as to act on my own?

534
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,840
I hope that in the future,

535
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,760
there will be more peaceful days ahead.

536
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,720
Your Highness, don't you wish to know

537
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,280
the truth behind the Jinxiu Incident?

538
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,640
What good would knowing the truth do?

539
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,320
The dead

540
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,480
can never return.

541
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,240
The deceased have passed,

542
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,360
and they have found peace.

543
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,080
It's merely

544
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,160
a comforting statement for the living.

545
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,640
What really happened in that incident?

546
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,880
Back then, no one dared to investigate.

547
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
What could be done today?

548
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,160
Today, I promise

549
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,680
to thoroughly investigate the incident

550
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,840
and bring the truth to Your Highness.

551
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,280
Very well.

552
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
Then I will await your findings.

553
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,520
Your Highness, the Mingsheng Temple

554
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,920
is a place of controversy.

555
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,160
If Her Majesty learns

556
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,240
that you have been there,

557
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,320
you will surely be accused of

558
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,160
forming factions

559
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,040
and plotting treason.

560
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,960
To fabricate a crime,

561
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,160
there's no need for evidence.

562
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,600
Back then, my aunt was involved in the

563
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,160
Jinxiu Workshop Incident

564
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,520
over a single piece of clothing.

565
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,600
Please be cautious with your words.

566
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
Exercise caution!

567
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,600
You just performed a charitable act

568
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,160
that has pleased her Majesty.

569
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,680
You must avoid any actions

570
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,040
that might displease her.

571
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,800
Do not overlook the details,

572
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
or you risk suffering great losses.

573
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,720
Shen Du has long been aware of this

574
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,000
but has chosen not to report it.

575
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,720
He is quite astute.

576
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
It's already dawn,

577
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,520
why hasn't Lord Shen returned yet?

578
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,720
It's about time.

579
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Take her!

580
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,520
You really are stubborn.

581
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,360
I recall that back then, you were

582
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,360
the one who fell into Shen Du's trap.

583
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,840
Now you're heeding his words?

584
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,840
Her Majesty' decree orders Lord Lai

585
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,560
to interrogate at the hour of the snake(9am.)

586
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
The time has not yet arrived,

587
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,360
so she shouldn't be taken.

588
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,440
The Delinquent dare to obstruct

589
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,160
the Imperial Inspectorate's duties?

590
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,640
I'm quite eager to find out

591
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,200
how tough

592
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,680
your skull really is.

593
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,240
[What a magnificent display of authority.]

594
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,280
But it seems Lord Lai

595
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,280
lacks a bit of patience.

596
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,440
In serving Her Majesty,

597
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,040
one must give their utmost effort.

598
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,200
Her Majesty' decree:

599
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,600
The Mingsheng Temple case has many uncertainties.

600
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,440
It's fully entrusted to the Imperial Guard.

601
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,920
A thorough investigation is required.

602
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,880
Lord Shen,

603
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,720
weren't you the fast one?

604
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,560
Let's go!

605
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,960
Why isn't she out yet?

606
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,480
Oh lord!

607
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,840
Come out, now!

608
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,320
Xing!

609
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
You finally made it out!

610
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
I was so worried about you!

611
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,280
Here, here.

612
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,920
Misfortune, out!

613
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,240
As long as you came out

614
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,600
safe and sound, that's what matters.

615
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,600
You little toots,

616
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,960
what kind of investigation was it

617
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,600
that you almost got yourself busted?

618
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,120
But, you are safe,

619
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,120
and that's what truly matters.

620
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,960
Do you know,

621
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,320
when I heard you had killed someone

622
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,800
and were arrested,

623
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
I was worried sick!

624
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,760
Come on, a bit more,

625
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,520
to drive away the bad luck.

626
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,400
A bit more!

627
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,720
Fate has favored me with a robust life.

628
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,480
Now that my suspicions have been cleared,

629
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,760
I am safe and sound, right?

630
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,360
If it weren't for Lord Shen

631
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,440
going to meet Princess Runing

632
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,520
to clarify the situation

633
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,520
and discovering the chest

634
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,280
used to transport the body

635
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
to frame you, which was found in

636
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,040
the woods outside the Mingsheng Temple,

637
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,600
do you really think you could

638
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,840
have gotten out so easily?

639
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,640
He went to see the princess?

640
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,200
What did you just say?

641
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,240
The chest used to transport the body

642
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,480
was thrown into the woods?

643
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,319
That doesn't sound right.

644
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:42,799
What's not right?

645
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,160
You must be in shock.

646
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,560
It's all right now.

647
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,239
By the way,

648
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,560
Mr. Xu and Jiang Langxing

649
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,319
went off to pursue

650
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,600
new leads.

651
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,480
I heard that

652
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,040
the deceased servant of the Chen Family

653
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,279
had been embezzling assets

654
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:58,960
from the Chen Family.

655
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,560
He was later discovered by Lady Chen,

656
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,759
which led to his betrayal.

657
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:03,520
It's unclear who

658
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,480
he colluded with.

659
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,080
He was silenced for it.

660
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,360
Too bad, death leaves no witness.

661
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:09,600
Yan Xing!

662
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,239
Lord Shen,

663
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,279
are you here to take her back home?

664
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:22,719
What's the point of going home?

665
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,040
I'm feeling incredibly motivated now.

666
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,719
I need to dig into this case

667
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,239
to clear my name.

668
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,840
What are you doing?

669
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,400
From this moment on,

670
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,560
you are not allowed to pursue this case.

671
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,480
Things have already progressed this far.

672
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,360
You expect me to just step back?

673
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,600
How can I simply walk away from this?

674
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,520
Besides,

675
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,240
the corpse of that servant

676
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,360
should be at the Ministry of Justice.

677
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,560
I have to find

678
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,480
clues from him.

679
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,200
I said no, and that's final.

680
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
The culprit used the servant

681
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,600
to lure me to Mingsheng Temple.

682
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
Without a doubt, they aimed

683
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,560
to make me doubt Princess Runing.

684
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,480
Princess Runing has not set foot

685
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,840
outside the Mingsheng Temple for years.

686
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,840
Who is trying to drag her

687
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,080
into this mess?

688
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,840
Enough already!

689
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,640
This could involve the royal family,

690
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,640
so you want me to stop the investigation?

691
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,000
Leave this case to me.

692
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,560
I will take care of it.

693
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,480
I just want to reveal the truth.

694
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,320
Your apprehension of

695
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,040
the high and mighty

696
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,920
is evident, Lord Shen.

697
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,640
Fine,

698
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,120
I'll investigate this case myself.

699
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,720
You, Shen Du, the mighty Lord Shen,

700
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,680
you're free to

701
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,640
walk your own path.

702
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,840
So this is how you perceive me.

703
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,640
Haven't you always been

704
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,360
afraid of being implicated?

705
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,680
Let's part ways now

706
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
to save you from

707
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,920
writing a guilty plea.

708
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,840
Xing!

709
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,880
What now?

710
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,760
Where are you going?

711
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,480
To examine the corpse.

712
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,600
Shen Du had already examined it earlier.

713
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,240
His shoes are clean,

714
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,680
without any dirt from the woods.

715
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
He must have been brought to

716
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,080
the Mingsheng Temple after he had died.

717
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,720
What's going on?

718
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,560
Did you discover something?

719
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,480
Take a whiff of this.

720
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,000
This odor, is from something

721
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,800
to slow down the decomposition.

722
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,600
By the time I arrived

723
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,040
at Chen residence,

724
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,760
he was already dead.

725
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,440
As for what transpired afterward,

726
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,400
even though I witnessed it firsthand,

727
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,440
I couldn't be certain

728
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
that it reflects the truth.

729
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,600
Are you suggesting that

730
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,800
everything you saw was just an illusion?

731
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,080
Then what is that?

732
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,200
Or what kind of substance can so

733
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
effectively manipulate people's minds?

734
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,120
In this vast world,

735
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,640
with all its mysteries,

736
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,360
I can only conclude

737
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,840
that it lies far beyond our grasp.

738
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,000
Furthermore,

739
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,760
what concerns me even more is

740
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,720
the method used on this servant

741
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,440
to delay the

742
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,920
time of death of the corpse.

743
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,160
It's the same technique that

744
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,120
Lady Tang used back then.

745
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,680
Do you really believe there's a way to

746
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,200
bring the dead back to life?

747
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,160
Are you worried that Chen Huo'e

748
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,960
might actually come back to life,

749
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,160
as others say?

750
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,080
Yes.

751
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,240
I don't buy it.

752
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,000
That's why I need to uncover the truth.

753
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
So,

754
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,040
you had a quarrel with your husband

755
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,120
and decided to run away from home?

756
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,600
I'm just concerned

757
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,400
that if in the future

758
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,600
White Death isn't around to protect you, what

759
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,920
will you do if someone tries to harm you?

760
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
What do I have to be scared of?

761
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,840
I still have you all, right?

762
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,160
If you go back to the Yans and your mother

763
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,360
finds out, she'll give you a good scolding.

764
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,040
Don't worry.

765
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,640
I've already figured out where to go.

766
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,960
[This place houses a collection of]

767
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,760
[case files from over the years.]

768
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,920
[I refuse to believe]

769
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
[that I can't find any clues.]

770
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,480
Clerk Yan.

771
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,360
Lord Ji.

772
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,080
What brings you here so late at night?

773
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Lord Ji.

774
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,720
I'd like to search for all the records

775
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,840
related to the Jinxiu Workshop case

776
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,520
over the years.

777
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,480
You've been managing the archives for years.

778
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,680
Do you know where I might find them?

779
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,040
Jinxiu Shop...

780
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,280
It's from quite a while ago.

781
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,920
It might be over there.

782
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,760
Feel free to take a look.

783
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,880
Thank you.

784
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,360
[This scent...]

785
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,520
[Where have I encountered it before?]

786
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,160
Clerk Yan,

787
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,680
be careful with the candles.

788
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,840
Thank you.

789
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,680
I'll be cautious.

790
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,520
[Haven't you always been]

791
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,480
[afraid of being implicated?]

792
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,840
[Let's part ways now]

793
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,000
[to save you from]

794
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,040
[writing a guilty plea.]

795
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,480
Mother.

796
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,560
Oranges.

797
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,360
The branches of the orange tree outside

798
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,600
happened to fall into the garden.

799
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,520
I know you love oranges, mother,

800
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,120
so I picked some for you.

801
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,000
Did you write

802
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,120
what I asked you to?

803
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,880
I don't know how.

804
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,160
I also shouldn't.

805
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,040
Father was an upright official,

806
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,600
always adhering to the principles

807
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,120
passed down by the Shen Family.

808
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,160
Father was framed;

809
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,800
how can I accept those false accusations

810
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,360
on his behalf?

811
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,120
Enough!

812
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,600
You're now registered as a criminal.

813
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,520
If you don't cut all ties with the Shens,

814
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,760
you'll never have

815
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,240
a chance to rise above this.

816
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,120
I cannot bear

817
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,520
to survive alone

818
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,840
while my father is dishonored.

819
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,440
I prefer

820
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,200
to die nobly,

821
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,320
as my father would.

822
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,000
But if you die too,

823
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
then this injustice

824
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,080
will truly be buried forever.

825
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,360
Shen Du,

826
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,040
do you really want them

827
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,400
to never find peace

828
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,320
even in the afterlife?

829
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,480
[If you refuse to write that confession,]

830
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,640
[then from this moment on, you can]

831
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,560
[forget about having me as your mother.]
