Mr. Xu, the embroidery on your clothes

4
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,800
is truly exquisite.

5
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,040
[Look at the peach blossom pattern,]

6
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
I wonder which fair lady

7
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,760
embroidered it for you?

8
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm surprised you would say that.

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,640
Actually, I'm fond of peach blossoms,

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,000
[so I picked one with that embroidery.]

11
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,960
Oh, I see.

12
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,000
No wonder it looks so familiar.

13
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
So this embroidery pattern

14
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
is the one I've seen

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
in a pre-made boutique.

16

20

Why aren't you wearing it?

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,240
I might have forgotten it in the rush.

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,680
I can't remember where I left it.

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,560
You seem to be quite busy tonight.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
In chaos, errors are inevitable.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,240

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,040

[If I'm not mistaken,]

46

47

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,440

What's that for?

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,320

The die is cast.

126

You have to go through with it!

127
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,520
It's a mistake! We should let her go!

128

[Suddenly, a noise came from a distance.]

130
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
I'll check over there.

131
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,120
[I suspected someone was tailing us,]

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,040
[so I the argument ended.]

just a feral cat in the bushes.

142
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,760
Perhaps it made the sound.

143
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,400
[I was in complete shock,]

144

[fearing that the murderer would return]

[and kill me as well,]

146
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560

Then,

152
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,240
how can you prove

153
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,960
that you didn't argue and that

154
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,680
he wasn't killed by you?

155
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
If I had to fight with him,

156
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,320
he'd definitely have had the upper hand.

157

164
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,320
The evidence in Lady Du's case is solid.

165

gonna sleep after a whole night of fuss?

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,680
Is the fearless Lady Yan so

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,840
scared of sharing a bed with her husband?

173
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,720
I do want to sleep,

but as soon as I lie down, my mind

175
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,360
is filled with thoughts of the case.

176
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,160
It's resolved smoothly, but I

177
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
can't shake the sense of hidden truths.

178
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,480
Smoothly?

179
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,600
I chased the suspect until midnight,

180
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,600
and it took him a long time to confess.

181
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
And it's only after being tortured

182
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,760
he finally revealed everything.

183
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,320
What I'm referring to

184
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,280
is not just the bride abduction case.

185
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,000
Even though it's closed,

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
with the kidnapper scummy dead,

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
there's a new murder case to deal with.

188
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
He's a mere thug.

189
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,520
Here in Yingzhou,

190
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
he must have had many personal grudges.

191
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,800
What kind of grudges

192
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,320
would lead to such a convoluted plot,

193
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,520
killing him and

194
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,280
then removing his eyes?

195
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,560
Was the appearance of the murderer

196
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
a coincidence, or was it all premeditated?

197
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,560
It's difficult to figure out right now.

198
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
You should get some rest.

199
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,000
But I can't fall asleep.

200
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,920
Among his friends and family,

201
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,040
the most probable suspect would be...

202
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,920
Since you're so energetic,

203
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
why not do something else?

204
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
You...

205
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,720
What are you up to?

206
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,120
You know,

207
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
as your husband...

208
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,720
You...

209
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,760
Out of your mind?

210
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
They dub me the White Death,

211
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,800
my word is law,

212
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
my oaths unwavering.

213
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,920
Yet in your sight, my love,

214
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,280
I am merely a lunatic, huh?

215
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,120
What did you give me?

216
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Slumber Pill.

217
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,560
It can help you fall asleep.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
Sweet dreams, my love.

219
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,480
[My Lord.]

220
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
[My Lord.]

221
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,640
A letter from Xiang'an.

222
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,680
Why is it so urgent?

223
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,840
The lady is just about to sleep,

224
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
and I haven't let you in yet.

225
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
Apologies.

226
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,800
But as asked, I have to

227
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
report such letters instantly.

228
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,880
An urgent letter from Xiang'an?

229
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,240
Who sent it?

230
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,920
Lady Xu.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,000
There's nothing discreet about it.

232
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,200
Would you read it first, my love?

233
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,040
Nope,

234
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,040
I'm not interested in your love letters.

235
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,800
I'm gonna sleep.

236
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,600
Lady Xu and I are not

237
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,040
romantically involved!

238
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
Besides, the one I care about

239
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,240
is someone else.

240
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,560
Yan Xing?

241
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,200
It really takes effect at the right time.

242
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,160
[We are Masked Specters.]

243
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,120
[When are you going to find my head?]

244
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,280
[Hand over your head!]

245
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,680
[Who's there?]

246
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,560
[Who is it?]

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
[Show yourself now!]

248
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
[My eyes...]

249
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,760
[My eyes!]

250
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,040
No!

251
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
Is this...

252
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
a red-feathered gray pigeon?

253
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
[The arrival of this pigeon]

254
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
[indicates that there are]

255
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,400
[definitely undercover agents]

256
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,440
[from Her Highness in Yingzhou]

257
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,400
[who cannot show themselves.]

258
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,960
[The pigeon is a signal]

259
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,760
[that I should report to the capital.]

260
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,560
Xing!

261
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
Hi, Xing.

262
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
Did you bring this gray pigeon?

263
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,080
Are you...

264
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,840
No,

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,280
I just saw it hovering

266
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,520
in your courtyard,

267
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,400
refusing to leave.

268
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,960
Have you

269
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,560
heard of the legend?

270
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,560
If a red-feathered gray pigeon

271
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,440
makes its home at your place,

272
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,840
it means you will have great fortune.

273
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,920
You must keep it.

274
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,680
So I hurried to the street

275
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,920
to buy you a birdcage.

276
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Is that so?

277
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,360
So you came

278
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,800
to bring me the cage?

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,600
There's one more thing.

280
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,480
We've run out of deer antlers.

281
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,120
However, Gannan is low on herb reserves.

282
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,360
I've checked in the largest healing house,

283
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Guangchun Hall.

284
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,040
But they said they've never stored

285
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,360
such a rare item.

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,120
They only have Cistanche.

287
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,440
It may need to be sourced from elsewhere.

288
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,120
Cistanche, huh?

289
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,920
Although it's somewhat inferior,

290
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,200
it can still serve as a substitute.

291
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,800
The shopkeeper

292
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,840
agreed to sell me the last bit,

293
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,880
but I haven't placed the order yet.

294
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,040
Take me there.

295
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,880
Let's go get some now.

296
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,520
Alright.

297
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,680
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

298
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,280
Easy, easy.

299
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,960
Big healing houses are indeed thriving.

300
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,960
Even the pots for decoction

301
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,320
have to be custom-made this large.

302
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,120
They shouldn't be for decoction,

303
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
but rather for storing herbs.

304
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,560
By the way, Yeyun, I asked you

305
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,440
to keep an eye on the provincial office

306
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
for any suspicious individuals.

307
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Have you found anyone?

308
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,840
Sis, your instructions are something

309
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
I have definitely taken to heart.

310
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,480
I haven't spotted anyone for now,

311
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,400
but I did learn about

312
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,640
a suspicious place.

313
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,760
I've heard there's an inner chamber

314
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,080
that no one is allowed to enter,

315
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,480
yet Lord Mo frequently visits it himself.

316
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,480
[Yingzhou is a harsh and frigid place,]

317
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,520
[but it boasts such vibrant peonies.]

318
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,920
[Pink peonies?]

319
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,000
Lord Shen, this way please.

320
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,520
Very well.

321
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,120
What brings him here?

322
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,840
Yingzhou's situated in the northern cold region.

323
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,920
It often experiences snowfall in winter.

324
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,520
To have such a warm room to nurture flowers

325
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
must have required considerable effort.

326
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Qianzhi.

327
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,320
Lord Shen.

328
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,200
Do you have to distance yourself

329
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,280
from me?

330
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,800
In this day and age,

331
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
your position is quite significant.

332
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,360
I have experienced the trials

333
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,800
and tribulations of officialdom.

334
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
I simply wish to live a stable life and

335
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,040
have no desire to climb the social ladder

336
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,520
or create difficulties for you.

337
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,840
I hope you can understand.

338
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,760
In public,

339
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
I understand your reluctance

340
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,920
to be associated with me.

341
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,880
But now it's just the two of us.

342
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Do you truly wish to keep me

343
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,000
at a distance?

344
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,680
Back then,

345
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,320
you were imprisoned

346
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,120
and endured great suffering.

347
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
In the end,

348
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,200
it's the politics of officialdom

349
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,040
that have entangled you.

350
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
So from that moment on,

351
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,800
I wished to keep

352
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,520
you away from any

353
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,880
further ties to officialdom.

354
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,400
But I never anticipated

355
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,680
that your exceptional talent

356
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,240
would still draw

357
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
the attention of Her Highness.

358
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,600
Now, you hold the position

359
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,880
of the commander of Imperial Guard,

360
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,560
while I,

361
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,200
can only remain a lower ranking official.

362
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
I see.

363
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,680
So you're blaming me, Qianzhi.

364
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,920
Exceptional talent?

365
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,120
Drawing attention?

366
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,080
The old acquaintances of the Shen Family,

367
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,320
my father's old friends,

368
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
who doesn't know that

369
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,280
I relied on selling my father for status,

370
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,920
and forced my own mother to her death

371
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,960
just to escape punishment.

372
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,880
[I hereby report!]

373
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,800
[The traitor Shen Bingzhu's son, Shen Du]

374
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,280
[accuses my father]

375
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,120
Such despicable behavior

376
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,640
is something everyone can scorn.

377
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,240
Especially you, Qianzhi.

378
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,240
You must feel a deep regret.

379
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,320
Back then, on the path of the palace,

380
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,600
you knelt all the way to the palace

381
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
to plead for Shen Family...

382
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,560
[Your Majesty!]

383
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,920
[Lord Shen has been wronged!]

384
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,160
[Your Majesty!]

385
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
[The Shens' women and children are innocent!]

386
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,640
The late emperor spared us,

387
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,880
considering your loyalty, thus avoiding

388
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,400
the death penalty for my mother and me.

389
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,920
And I was able to enter the Custodial Ward.

390
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,760
There's no need

391
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,880
to dwell on this.

392
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
My family has fallen into decline,

393
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,840
but fortunately, master (Lord Shen) took me in.

394
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
He has shown immense kindness to us Mos,

395
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,720
treating me like his own son.

396
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,320
Pleading before the late emperor

397
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,080
is my responsibility.

398
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
If I were to neglect this,

399
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,200
that would be disloyal and unjust.

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
You sacrificed a promising future,

401
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,680
exiled here with no hope for promotion,

402
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
just to save a disloyal, unjust,

403
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,120
and unfilial person like me,

404
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,880
merely to survive.

405
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,960
Using my father's reputation

406
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,120
to barter for my own bright future.

407
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,800
Qianzhi,

408
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,120
if you had known it would come to this,

409
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
would you have regretted it?

410
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,960
Looking back,

411
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
I have many regrets,

412
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
but saving you

413
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
has never been one!

414
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,480
What you did that day

415
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,600
was an act of desperation.

416
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,280
Master in heaven

417
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,360
will surely understand.

418
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,800
"Your mother

419
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,160
angrily driving you out of the house"

420
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,760
was merely a show

421
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,840
to deceive those petty ones.

422
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
It was just a distraction.

423
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,520
What she truly wanted

424
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,960
was to protect her only son.

425
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Qianzhi,

426
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,440
do you really not blame me?

427
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,920
Do you recognize this flower?

428
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,360
I do.

429
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,680
It's Xiuxiu's favorite flower, Tongzimian.

430
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,840
[Where are we going?]

431
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,320
[Hurry up!]

432
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,160
[Look,]

433
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,640
[Du has some real skills.]

434
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,680
[He helped me raised Tongzimian.]

435
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,560
[Du,]

436
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,840
[you're about to]

437
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,320
[spoil Mo Xiuxiu completely.]

438
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,280
[Tongzimian is rare to grow,]

439
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,000
[with dozens of peonies]

440
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
[not necessarily yielding one.]

441
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,480
[Other young ladies]

442
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,400
[would be satisfied]

443
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
[with just one peony on their head,]

444
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,160
[but you]

445
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,600
[insist on a Tongzimian.]

446
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,400
[What's wrong with that?]

447
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,800
[I just love it.]

448
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,080
[Du,]

449
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,480
[the one on my head]

450
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,000
[will soon wither in a few days.]

451
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,000
[When it comes to that,]

452
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,120
[remember to get the best one for me.]

453
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,880
[Rest assured,]

454
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,240
[I've already selected one.]

455
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,040
[I'll pluck for you in a few days.]

456
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
After Xiuxiu passed away,

457
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,200
I created this courtyard

458
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,760
filled with peonies in her memory.

459
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,560
Only then did I truly understand

460
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
how challenging it was for you

461
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,640
to cultivate

462
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,200
that Tongzimian.

463
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,920
Du,

464
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
how could I ever hold grudges against you?

465
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,160
I can only feel gratitude

466
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,960
that you managed to adapt

467
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,720
and live well.

468
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,760
So in this world,

469
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
there could be one more person like me

470
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
who cherishes Xiuxiu

471
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,120
and keeps her memory alive.

472
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,720
Life is indeed unpredictable.

473
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,840
I never imagined that

474
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,640
our farewell in the capital would turn out

475
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,360
to be my final goodbye to Xiuxiu.

476
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,480
If Xiuxiu were still alive,

477
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,520
she would be

478
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,000
about the same age as Lady Du now.

479
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,040
Qianzhi, there's something

480
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,160
I've always hesitated to ask.

481
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,800
How did she die?

482
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,640
It was my failure to care for her.

483
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
She fell ill due to the

484
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,920
unfamiliar environment.

485
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,280
[Xiuxiu?]

486
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
[I remember now,]

487
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,480
[the rattan pig and the letter]

488
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,160
[were gifts from Mo Xiuxiu.]

489
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,440
[That's why he has kept them for so long.]

490
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,600
Mo Xiuxiu,

491
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
what are you writing?

492
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,760
Sir,

493
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,280
you frightened them.

494
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,920
It's nothing, nothing.

495
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
Everyone, please continue your practice.

496
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,560
It seems these children

497
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,480
haven't yet moved on

498
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
from the trauma of being kidnapped.

499
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Du,

500
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,040
go collect some bulrushes.

501
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,680
Sure!

502
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,680
Sir.

503
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,320
My lord.

504
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Let's conclude

505
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
today's lesson here.

506
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,240
Understood.

507
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,440
Children,

508
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,160
in a moment,

509
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,640
I will teach you how to

510
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,080
weave small animals with the bulrushes.

511
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,160
Does that sound good?

512
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,040
Yes!

513
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,240
Du,

514
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,000
am I doing this correctly?

515
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,720
Du,

516
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,840
could you help me get started?

517
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,080
You're so talented!

518
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,800
I want to weave one for Du

519
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,160
as a birthday gift.

520
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,440
Can we trade?

521
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,440
Of course, take it!

522
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Thank you!

523
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,200
What's your name?

524
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,920
You can just call me Xing.

525
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,200
[Because that was a gift]

526
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,480
[from Mo Xiuxiu,]

527
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
[that's why he's treasured it for so long.]

528
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,280
[It turns out the one he truly loves]

529
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
[is Mo Xiuxiu.]

530
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,760
Today,

531
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,360
you asked to meet in private.

532
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,080
What is it about?

533
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,920
The Shen Family has suffered injustice,

534
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,200
and you're well aware of the details.

535
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,800
I was still quite young back then,

536
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,440
and many things remain unclear to me.

537
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,640
I hope you can share the details with me.

538
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,920
Lord Shen,

539
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,920
it's all in the past.

540
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,040
After so many years,

541
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,400
You have achieved great success,

542
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,520
with a bright future ahead of you.

543
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,560
Don't let the past weigh you down.

544
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,240
What do you mean by that?

545
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,760
The suffering of imprisonment is something

546
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,960
that ordinary people cannot bear.

547
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,200
Du,

548
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,240
now that you're free,

549
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,800
don't dwell on seeking revenge.

550
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,480
Du does not seek revenge.

551
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,240
But I'm a member of the Shen Family.

552
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,080
We deserve the truth.

553
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,600
You are now highly trusted

554
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,160
by Her Highness.

555
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,560
As long as you maintain your stability,

556
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,160
your future is boundless.

557
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,320
Do you truly have the courage

558
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,200
to give up everything

559
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,680
you currently possess?

560
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,360
If you want to thoroughly investigate it,

561
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,200
you must be prepared to give up

562
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,640
everything you have now.

563
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,560
Do you believe

564
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,120
it's worth it?

565
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,720
Throughout history, those who can

566
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,280
investigate and overturn old cases

567
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,720
are often those without vulnerabilities.

568
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,280
Now that you're married,

569
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,640
can you truly disregard everything,

570
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,760
burn your bridges,

571
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,080
and act solely for your own sake?

572
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,080
I still maintain my stance:

573
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,880
let's not revisit

574
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,400
the past any further.

575
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,000
Lord Shen,

576
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,360
the answer you seek

577
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
has already been provided to you.

578
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,920
I hope you could

579
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,920
think it through.

580
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,000
[His relationship with Mo Qianzhi]

581
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,120
[is indeed quite profound.]

582
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,400
[But anyone can see that Mo Qianzhi]

583
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,280
[is a principled official with integrity.]

584
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,400
[Alas, pigeon,]

585
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,520
[how should I]

586
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,120
[report to the Great Grandmother?]

587
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
My sweet master!

588
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,400
Sweet master? Think again?

589
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,280
What a naughty disciple!

590
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,600
Follow some decorum when you enter!

591
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,640
I knew it!

592
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,480
Sis got up early

593
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,520
to prepare medicinal dishes.

594
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,000
She is truly a remarkable wife!

595
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,920
She deserves someone better!

596
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,760
A lady like her

597
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,840
is indeed rare in this world,

598
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,440
and she is a perfect match for my lord.

599
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,960
Truly a pair of ideal partners!

600
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
A pair of ideal partners, you say?

601
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,760
You know,

602
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,600
your Lord Shen

603
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,920
certainly carries himself well in public.

604
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,960
However, at home, can he really be

605
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
considered a good husband?

606
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,160
Unlike sis,

607
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,840
who is a top-notch detective in public,

608
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,760
and a master chef at home!

609
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,800
How can it be said that

610
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
he's not a good husband at home?

611
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,400
Enough of that!

612
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,400
Do you need me for anything?

613
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,080
If not, please step outside.

614
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,160
I need some peace and quiet!

615
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,400
Yeah, I do.

616
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,760
I really do.

617
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,040
I just wanted to ask

618
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,960
how the deer antler and cistanche

619
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,080
turned out.

620
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,880
Is it usable?

621
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,760
After all, it's just a budget substitute.

622
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
If it doesn't work,

623
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,840
order Jing Lin

624
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,360
to the neighboring county for supplies!

625
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,680
This is to prepare medicinal dishes

626
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
for his Lord Shen.

627
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,880
He has to contribute as well.

628
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,280
C'mon, stop saying that.

629
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,840
You're also

630
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,880
being fed by the Imperial Guard, you know?

631
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,960
You also freeload on our daily training,

632
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,560
and I'm forced

633
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,080
to take you on as

634
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,200
a less-than-stellar disciple!

635
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,080
Jing Lin,

636
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,560
I must convey this to you seriously.

637
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
The only master

638
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,640
I truly wish to have

639
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,280
is right here in front of you,

640
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,520
Scribe of the Ministry of Justice, Yan Xing.

641
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,880
She's not accepting me at the moment,

642
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,960
so I've reluctantly allowed you to indulge

643
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,120
in your desire to play the role of a master.

644
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,800
Mind your tongue!

645
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,000
What do you mean

646
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
you're reluctant?

647
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,920
You're the one who should mind the tongue!

648
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,360
Do you think I want

649
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,440
to take you as my disciple?

650
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,560
Speak to me with respect.

651
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,520
Out, out, out!

652
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,480
You need to clarify this!

653
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,960
[Substitute.]

654
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,040
[Leaving home.]

655
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,680
[Reuniting with an old friend.]

656
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
[A lonely man and a lonely woman.]

657
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,200
[A fleeting infatuation.]

658
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,320
[Perhaps what I feel as ambiguous]

659
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,400
[and enchanting]

660
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,240
[is merely because I am seen as]

661
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,640
[a substitute for Xiuxiu.]

662
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,840
[Yan Xing,]

663
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,560
[do you have the luxury to dwell on this?]

664
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,720
Xing!

665
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,560
You mean that

666
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,920
Lord Mo has agreed

667
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,040
to combine the bride abduction case

668
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,640
with the decapitation case?

669
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
Not a full consent,

670
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,960
but he allowed me to conduct a comparative

671
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,280
examination of the two bodies

672
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,400
following the coroner's

673
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,520
preliminary check.

674
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,920
At least there's a chance to combine the cases.

675
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,600
Do you want to join me in autopsy?

676
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,960
Absolutely, let's go!

677
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,960
Sist, I'll grab the toolbox for you!

678
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,040
Sis, here.

679
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,440
Let's head out.

680
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,240
Mind your step.

681
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,560
They seem to have a lot to discuss.

682
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,000
My lady just feels you're too noisy!

683
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,120
You're noisy!

684
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
You are even worse!

685
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,720
You're the noisy one!

686
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,480
So childish.

687
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:36,120
Wait a minute,

688
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,799
we can't let them chat too much!

689
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,880
Where are you off to?

690
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Hmph, you're the childish one!

691
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,600
What are your thoughts

692
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,560
on the murderer's characteristics?

693
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Not much to say,

694
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,839
but the whole Yingzhou is abuzz.

695
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,000
Everyone is convinced that

696
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,960
the murderer is the notorious

697
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,120
masked specter

698
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,920
from Gannan.

699
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,000
They say the masked specter

700
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,920
only consumes

701
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,640
one specific part of the body each time.

702
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,359
This indeed aligns with

703
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,240
the previous two cases.

704
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
There're many ghost stories in the folklore.

705
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,560
While ordinary folks might believe them,

706
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,080
you, the top detective,

707
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
do you also believe in ghosts?

708
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,520
I don't believe in ghosts,

709
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,319
but I do respect legends.

710
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,840
Regardless of their origin,

711
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,680
the fact that they've spread across

712
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,120
the city must have its reasons.

713
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
There might be someone behind it, or

714
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,080
it could reflect the local circumstances.

715
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,320
Do you remember

716
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,000
how this rumor goes?

717
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,560
The masked specter

718
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,840
strikes when the victim is unconscious,

719
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,600
and when the victim awakens,

720
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,800
they find they're missing an arm or a leg.

721
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,680
Exactly.

722
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
That's why all the cases

723
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,960
involving the masked specter

724
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,200
are so difficult to investigate.

725
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
First,

726
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,480
there's no immediate threat to life.

727
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Second,

728
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,960
everyone fears ghosts,

729
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,480
and the victims are terrified,

730
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,560
so they don't dare to cooperate,

731
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,280
which ultimately leads to a dead end.

732
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,200
Additionally,

733
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,040
these two corpses...

734
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,360
These two corpses

735
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,760
were alive when they were

736
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,800
beheaded or had their eyes gouged out,

737
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,720
and the victims ultimately died.

738
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,840
Either the murder

739
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,480
is not the same masked specter,

740
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,880
or he was trying to

741
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,840
imitate the masked specter but failed.

742
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,320
Only Lady Yan has the audacity

743
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
to not fear ghosts

744
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,160
and dare to join me

745
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,440
in navigating this murky situation.

746
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,320
A murderer

747
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,680
is nothing to be afraid of.

748
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,480
Whether human or ghost,

749
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,920
a killer must face the consequences.

750
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
Even if it's an evil spirit,

751
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,760
it should be us

752
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,240
who judge in place of the King of Hell.

753
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,680
You...

754
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,440
What's wrong?

755
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,920
The corpse has bruises.

756
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,080
It likely fell into the well,

757
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,160
causing external injuries.

758
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,240
There are no internal injuries.

759
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,320
The cause of death was a

760
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,360
shattered heart, leading to instant death.

761
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,600
The corpse shows signs of lividity

762
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,800
and also signs of decay.

763
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,920
The shattered heart

764
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
accelerated the decomposition process.

765
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,320
Inside his abdomen,

766
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,120
it must now be a puddle of mush.

767
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,800
The marks from this wound are completely

768
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,600
different from those on the headless corpse,

769
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,920
more decisive and clean-cut.

770
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Did you find anything?

771
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,360
I can't quite recall right now

772
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,720
what kind of weapon caused this.

773
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
But it's definitely not the kind of

774
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,400
curved blade from the Western Regions

775
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,600
we encountered earlier.

776
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,720
It seems more like a specially crafted one.

777
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,400
Are you suggesting it's a weapon

778
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,760
designed specifically for gouging eyes?

779
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,120
Seems like something like this.

780
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,640
But I can't be certain

781
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,400
if such a thing truly exists.

782
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,920
Brass knuckles?

783
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,440
That indeed exists!

784
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,680
It's a weapon

785
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,160
worn on the fingers,

786
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,720
sharp as a

787
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
knife or sword.

788
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
However, this weapon is quite sinister,

789
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,920
and typically only those

790
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,560
who practice dark arts would use it.

791
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,280
Using such a thing

792
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,320
on a petty thug

793
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,320
is something

794
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,760
we should reflect on deeply.

795
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,960
In that case,

796
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,080
this case has no direct connection

797
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,360
to the headless corpse case.

798
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,160
But the killer not only committed murder,

799
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,880
but also took the victim's eyes.

800
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,520
What could that possibly mean?

801
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,520
I have no idea.

802
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,040
Come take a look over here.

803
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
There's definitely something amiss.

804
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,640
There are some faint

805
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
blue marks on

806
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,320
the surface of the skin.

807
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
If you're feeling tired,

808
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
you can go back and rest.

809
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,760
Leave this to me.

810
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,080
I'm fine.

811
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,880
I just didn't get enough sleep last night,

812
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
so I'm a bit unfocused.

813
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,520
You two...

814
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Last night...

815
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280

[is truly an extraordinary lady.]

827
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,120
Mr. Pan,

828
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,120
in this stench-filled morgue,

829
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,360
you can still lose focus?

830
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,120
I'm truly impressed!

831
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,480
Lose focus?

832
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,360
What's on your mind?

833
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,320
Do you have any new insights

834
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,640
about this corpse?

835
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,440
Not really,

836
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,240
it's just that throughout my life,

837
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,200
I've never encountered a woman

838
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,880
as meticulous and brave as you.

839
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,040
Seeing you now,

840
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I'm truly in awe.

841
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,360
If you hate to share your real thoughts,

842
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,480
you don't have to say anything.

843
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,480
There's no need to use

844
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,960
such a forced excuse.

845
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,720
By the way,

846

847
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,320
was the corpse handled by anyone?

848
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,560
As far as I know,

849
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,840
the corpse hasn't been processed at all.

850
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,520
It's just that some preservative

851
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,800
was applied to this wound.

[unaware that they'll respawn]

863
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,120
[after being tempered]

864
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,640
[in the fire.]

865
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,080
It's the Fire Moth Sect again.

866
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,080
[Brothers are not like brothers,]

867
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,600
[people are not like people.]

868
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,240
[Disrespecting the fire moth]

869
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,640
[brings disaster from above.]

870
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,040
This is... madness!

871
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,800
It's not madness.

872
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,400
There's a schemer at work.

873
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,640
How do you know

874
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,960
to use preservative?

875
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,160
My master told me

876
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,080
that in the Western Regions,

877
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,640
rice soup would be used

878
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,240
for writing on sheepskin.

879
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,920
Once it dries,

880
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,760
the words will vanish without a trace.

881
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,680
After the preservative

882
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,840
is applied

883
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,240
to the sheepskin,

884
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
they will turn blue

885
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,560
and reappear on it.

886
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,760
I just checked.

887
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,080
There're blue marks on the skin

888
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,320
at the decapitation site as well.

889
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,520
So I decided to try it.

890
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,080
[Rape and plunder,]

891
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,480
[death is no loss.]

892
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,120
[Disrespecting the fire moth]

893
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,680
[brings disaster from above.]

894
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,840
To preserve the corpse,

895
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,640
the coroner would use preservative

896
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,360
to soak the wound.

897
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,360
They chose rice soup

898
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,400
that would make the handwriting visible

899
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,880
upon contact with preservative.

900
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,720
I would go

901
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,840
so far as to say

902
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,160
that they never intended

903
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,800
to keep the handwriting confidential,

904
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,960
even intentionally

905
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,360
allowing it to be seen.

906
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,280
Actually,

907
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,080
they don't mind us linking

908
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
the Fire Moth Sect

909
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,560
with the masked specter.

910
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,280
This crime

911
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,360
is like a boastful proclamation,

912
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,960
seemingly telling us

913
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,880
that the Fire Moth Sect

914
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
has infiltrated Gannan

915
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,240
far beyond our imagination.

916
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,000
In our investigation,

917
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,320
every move we make

918
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,120
is under their watchful eye.

919
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,200
Disrespecting the fire moth

920
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,280
brings disaster from above.
