00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:14,960
[English subtitles are available]

[Melody of Golden Age]
[EP18]

3
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Lord Shen had successfully cleared the name

4
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,600
of the Jinxiu Silk Workshop,

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,480
bringing the real culprit to justice.

6
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,720
It's truly satisfying to see.

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,000
The injustice has been redressed.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,960
It's truly wonderful.

9
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,760
The position of the lady of the house

10
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,080
will be mine from now on.

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,400
What are you still doing here?

12
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,360
Something's happened!

13
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,520
Lord Shen insisted on reopening the case

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
and has displeased Her Majesty.

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,840
His entire household will be executed!

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,560
But Shen Du

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,600
didn't defy Her Majesty!

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,360
[Xing,]

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,120
didn't you have

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
a strong desire for the truth?

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,520
And yet, you now

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
feel pity for Shen Du?

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,280
I didn't.

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
This isn't fair.

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
There's no such thing as fairness.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
Even with my knowledge and skill,

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
I still couldn't attain a title

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,920
because of my humble origins.

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,680
The truth,

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,480
or keeping Shen Du safe?

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,720
You can only choose one.

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
I won't choose.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,480
I can't choose.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,880
Move out of here now!

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
My lady, please help Lord Shen.

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,240
[Please think of something.]

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,920
[Xing.]

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,400
[Make your choice now.]

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,040
[This will all be mine from now on.]

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,520
[My lady,]

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,760
[we'll all be executed today.]

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,200
[My lady!]

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,760
[Don't you want to know the truth?]

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
[What are you waiting for?]

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,560
I'll never have to

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,360
fight for it with you again.

47
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,040
My lady!

48
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,960
Shen Du.

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,720
Put down.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,760
Put down

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,720
Put down one

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,120
Put down one cow.

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
What's put down one cow?

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
My lady, you're finally awake.

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,160
[Lord Shen has to talk to you and has]

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,200
[been waiting in his study for a while.]

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,080
He,

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,160
what time is it?

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
My lady, you've slept

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
until 6 o'clock in the afternoon.

62
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,880
[The sun is about to set.]

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,080
Could it be

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
that something is really about to happen?

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,640
Over here.

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,760
I heard you need to talk to me.

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,880
Yes.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
Did something happen?

69
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,560
These are the

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,280
files for the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case.

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
[I've organized them,]

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,680
they'll be easier to review from now on.

73
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,120
What do you mean?

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,200
Her Majesty has already agreed

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
to reopen this case.

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,479
Really?

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,120
Do I look like I'm

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
joking with you?

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
Then why did you make me

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,240
worry for so long?

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,440
I thought...

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
Are you worried that I would act selfishly

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,840
and rush to close the case?

84
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Or that I will report this

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,680
and upset Her Majesty?

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,160
Is there a difference?

87
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,840
Yes.

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Which one is it?

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,560
Why do I still have to choose

90
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
after waking up?

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm not choosing.

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,520
So?

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,280
What do you think?

94
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,640
I... I don't think anything.

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,520
I think you are a fair person.

96
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
This is exactly what someone

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,280
in a position of authority should do.

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Besides that,

99
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,520
you don't have anything else to say?

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,640
What should I say?

101
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,880
Did I say something wrong again?

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,480
No.

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,080
So confusing.

104
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,080
I heard that Lord Shen

105
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,720
had fiercely debated all in court,

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,960
showing no fear,

107
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,320
giving a rousing

108
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,520
and impassioned speech

109
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
and made Her Majesty to agree to

110
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
[reopen the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case.]

111
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,960
And you

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
must have been

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,840
giving him advice all along.

114
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,200
You've made great contributions!

115
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,080
What contributions?

116
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,120
I was the one who got drugged by Pan Chi

117
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,960
and ended up knocking myself out.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,000
I only

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
heard about this after I woke up.

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,760
Have you gone silly

121
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,480
from working on the cases too much?

122
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
Such a shame.

123
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,440
I could only hear about it

124
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,280
and couldn't be there to see

125
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
how imposing Lord Shen must have been.

126
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,520
Him?

127
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,960
He sure loves to flaunt his authority

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,600
in front of me every day.

129
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,720
You don't know how good you have it.

130
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,800
Lord Shen holds a high position

131
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
[and has a prestigious reputation.]

132
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
[Most importantly, he's very handsome.]

133
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,280
He always keeps a cold face.

134
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,200
So hideous.

135
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,480
Jing Lin.

136
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,920
My lord.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Am I

138
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,960
hideous?

139
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
Yun Que,

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
I have something to tell you.

141
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,160
I advise you not to

142
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
bother Lord Shen right now.

143
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,120
Mind your own business.

144
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,080
Have you ever thought about why

145
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,160
Lord Shen was dubbed

146
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,560
'the White Death'?

147
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm different from the others.

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,040
Just now,

149
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,560
even his expression has changed!

150
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,960
If you keep pushing,

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,840
twisting your head off

152
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,160
when he gets mad

153
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,760
is not entirely impossible.

154
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,320
You won't be able to scare me.

155
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,360
If you don't believe me,

156
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
go ahead and try.

157
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
I'm just curious about

158
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,160
the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case.

159
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Jing Lin,

160
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,120
you're always

161
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
working on cases with Lord Shen.

162
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,880
Now that Ji Fangming's been interrogated,

163
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
but who was really the one

164
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
behind the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case

165
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
back then?

166
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,160
You must know some insider information.

167
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,720
I

168
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,920
don't know anything.

169
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
You must know.

170
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
Just tell me.

171
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,720
Then let me ask you,

172
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,040
what's your family's relationship with

173
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
Kong Xianrong of the Jinxiu Silk Workshop

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,520
that you would work this hard

175
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,440
to overturn his case?

176
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
You wouldn't get it even if I tell you.

177
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,480
If you don't explain,

178
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,600
how will others understand?

179
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
What do you mean?

180
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,240
Your family had many dealings with

181
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,120
the Jinxiu Silk Workshop back then,

182
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,440
yet you were never implicated.

183
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,520
Why was that?

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
Are you interrogating me?

185
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,840
Or are you maybe

186
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
suspecting my family?

187
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,480
I...

188
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,480
[Have you heard?]

189
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,200
[Hundreds of moths]

190
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
[flew into Princess Ying's residence.]

191
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
[It was horrifying.]

192
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
[I heard]

193
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,640
[that they flew from the]

194
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,360
[Jinxiu Silk Workshop.]

195
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,680
They say it's the wrongly spirits

196
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,480
crying out,

197
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,680
seeking justice.

198
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,920
Was Princess Ying

199
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,080
the one behind

200
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,880
the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case?

201
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,920
Back then,

202
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
she did not

203
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,080
get along with Princess Runing.

204
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Aunt Runing,

205
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,160
[Mother has agreed to]

206
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,800
[reopen the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case.]

207
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,760
The injustice that has burdened you

208
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,720
[for so long can finally be righted.]

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,360
The old case can be overturned,

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,400
but the wrongfully executed

211
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
would never come back.

212
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
Your heart is still filled with hate?

213
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,440
[I could open my door to you today]

214
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,960
was because I have already

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
let it all go.

216
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,320
The dead are gone,

217
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
but the living

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,680
must carry on.

219
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,720
Now everybody's saying that

220
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,320
I was behind the

221
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,840
Jinxiu Silk Workshop case,

222
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,320
[that I killed your husband.]

223
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Don't you have anything

224
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,840
to ask me?

225
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,840
So?

226
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,720
It wasn't me.

227
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,000
If that's so,

228
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,360
why are you feeling unsettled again?

229
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,320
That invisible force

230
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,400
has returned,

231
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,320
[targeting the royal family this time.]

232
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,040
It wants to

233
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,440
bring us into chaos and turmoil.

234
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,640
I wasn't the first.

235
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
And you wouldn't be the last.

236
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
Since there's nothing that can be done,

237
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,600
might as well take things as they come.

238
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,080
I refuse to submit to fate.

239
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,560
Whether it's the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case

240
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,400
or the unsolved case of Chen Huo'e,

241
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,320
the IG,

242
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,280
the II,

243
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,640
the Imperial Court and Ministry of Justice

244
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,400
are all trying to solve the case.

245
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,240
The truth

246
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,840
will see the light of day.

247
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,560
The world is full of conflicts,

248
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,680
but I seek only a clear conscience.

249
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,840
Aunt Runing,

250
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,120
do you want to spend your whole life here

251
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,160
at the Mingsheng Temple?

252
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,720
The affairs of this world

253
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,920
are mere trivial matters.

254
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,280
Here,

255
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,640
it's peaceful and quiet.

256
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Fine.

257
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,680
I'm embarrassing myself here.

258
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,440
[It's still the same as always.]

259
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
I can't stand your high-mindedness,

260
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,680
and you despise my frivolous ways.

261
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,640
I heard that when Prince Xian came here,

262
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,760
you have drawn a divination for him.

263
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,040
[Could you]

264
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,280
do that for me too today?

265
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,760
I've only been practicing here

266
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,680
for a few short years.

267
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,520
My spirituality is not strong.

268
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm not very skilled

269
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,840
at interpreting signs either.

270
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,360
[If there's nothing else,]

271
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,520
you should head back early.

272
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,480
So you're asking me to leave.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,880
I know when to take a hint.

274
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,880
To meet is already a good omen,

275
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,560
[so why worry about more?]

276
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,280
Your Highness.

277
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,640
Shen Du.

278
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
Your Highness, did you come here at night

279
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,800
because you're concerned about the case of

280
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,280
Chen Huo'e and the Jinxiu Silk Workshop?

281
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Well

282
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,520
Are you also suspecting me now

283
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,800
and want to ask me questions?

284
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,200
Your Highness, you misunderstood me.

285
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,080
Your Highness,

286
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,480
I have a plan to help you

287
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
avoid unjust accusations.

288
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,360
[Here, here.]

289
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
[Bring it inside.]

290
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,960
[Okay, put it here.]

291
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
[My lord, my lord!]

292
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,160
-[Father!]
-Yun Que.

293
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,040
-Mother.
-Yun Que.

294
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
What are you doing here?

295
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,480
It was... It was this

296
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,440
young man

297
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,880
that tied u...

298
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
that escorted us here.

299
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,560
[Yeah, escorted us.]

300
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
How did you manage that?

301
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,320
I got them here for you, didn't I?

302
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,760
[He also said]

303
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,960
[you are getting married]

304
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
to Lord Shen.

305
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
Lord Shen,

306
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,360
[if you mean it,]

307
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,880
you could just tell me first.

308
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,280
There's no need for such a surprise.

309
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Xing!

310
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,640
You

311
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
handle this thing.

312
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,560
My lord, my lady,

313
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,400
you came all the way here to Xiang'an.

314
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,120
You must be

315
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,760
tired from the journey.

316
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,280
[Why don't you get some rest first]

317
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,640
and we'll talk about this

318
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,600
and make plans later.

319
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,400
Please,

320
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
come rest in the hall.

321
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,280
This is how you 'invited' them?

322
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,280
You didn't tell me how should I do it.

323
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,280
They wouldn't cooperate anyway.

324
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,760
Plus,

325
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
it's safer this way.

326
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,520
By the way,

327
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,760
I found out something else

328
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,360
that you would be interested in.

329
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,560
Lord Shen, please.

330
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,320
Yun Que is not here,

331
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,120
so let's be straightforward.

332
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,080
[My lord, my lady,]

333
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,000
we didn't invite you to Xiang'an

334
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,920
for Yun Que's wedding.

335
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,720
[Lord Shen]

336
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
is just hosting Yun Que here.

337
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,440
He never

338
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,720
had the intention to marry her.

339
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,159
I hope

340
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,640
you can tell the truth about

341
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,560
the Jinxiu Silk Workshop this time.

342
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,399
Lady Yan, what do you mean?

343
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,800
[We don't understand.]

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
It hasn't been safe for you

345
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,199
to come to Xiang'an.

346
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,360
I don't need to mention the assassins,

347
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,159
you must have heard about them yourselves.

348
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,080
At this point,

349
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,800
if you keep hiding it,

350
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,640
perhaps even Lord Shen

351
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,600
[could not protect you anymore.]

352
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,880
That is true.

353
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,400
The Shen residence surely doesn't

354
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,080
need to protect those who are unimportant.

355
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,280
My lord,

356
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,000
[since they're not willing to talk,]

357
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,200
then we

358
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
don't have to waste more time.

359
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,400
[There has been many wrongful spirits]

360
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,240
near the Jinxiu Silk Workshop lately.

361
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,240
I am timid

362
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,040
[and do not wish to cause trouble.]

363
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,200
[Why don't we]

364
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
pack up their things and

365
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
[send them on their way before dark.]

366
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
Whether they live or die,

367
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,640
we should just let it be.

368
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,840
Sure.

369
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,920
-Wait.
-My lord.

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
Yun Que is innocent.

371
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,800
Lord Yun,

372
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,440
we wouldn't want to

373
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,840
see you in danger either.

374
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,000
[But now,]

375
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,360
[someone's been using the Jinxiu Silk]

376
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,440
[Workshop case to stir up troubles.]

377
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,240
Even if you conceal what you know,

378
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,120
will the instigator

379
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,240
truly protect you?

380
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,640
[We have wronged Jinxiu Silk Workshop.]

381
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,520
We have wronged Lord Kong.

382
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,400
[But,]

383
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,120
[we had no choice.]

384
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,080
[If we]

385
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,520
[didn't keep it to ourselves,]

386
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,320
then our whole family

387
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,200
would have been killed as well.

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,760
[When I reviewed the evidence back then,]

389
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
I did find something strange and

390
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,240
[was going to tell Lord Kong right away.]

391
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,600
But that very night,

392
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,240
someone threatened me

393
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,360
[and told us to keep our mouth shut,]

394
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,240
[or]

395
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,200
they would've killed Yun Que.

396
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
[So we]

397
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,520
[had to keep that deal and didn't]

398
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,240
[dare speak up for Jinxiu Silk Workshop.]

399
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,760
And it's been many years,

400
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,440
but the one that had threatened us

401
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
has never stopped watching us.

402
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,040
[If this is the case,]

403
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,880
then how did the evidence

404
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
end up in Yun Que's hand?

405
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,000
And how did she get to Xiang'an safely

406
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
and go to the court by herself?

407
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,640
It was that person

408
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,040
who asked us to do it.

409
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,720
[We couldn't figure out either]

410
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,600
[why such a request suddenly.]

411
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,040
But

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
we had no choice but to do it.

413
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,160
[So we had to put on a show,]

414
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,000
[and let Yun Que find out a little bit.]

415
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,520
[Given her temperament,]

416
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,120
she would certainly take those evidence

417
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
and go to court.

418
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,160
Who is the one that had

419
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,280
threatened you?

420
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,640
It's...

421
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,960
It's...

422
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,920
It's... It's Chen Huo'e.

423
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,840
-Que.
-[Que.]

424
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,920
So,

425
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,840
you knew long ago

426
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,720
that the Kong family was framed.

427
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,200
[But to protect yourselves,]

428
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,400
[you ignored the grievances of all those]

429
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,320
people from the Jinxiu Silk Workshop

430
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,800
when you knew there were hidden truths.

431
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,520
[Que,]

432
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,040
we had no other choice.

433
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Your mother and I

434
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,240
dared not risk your life and

435
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,080
the life of everyone in our family for it.

436
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,120
Father,

437
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,080
Mother,

438
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,960
then what's the difference between us

439
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
and an accomplice?

440
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,080
[Yes, we were coward.]

441
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,040
[If there is any retribution,]

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
let it fall upon us.

443
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,600
[Que,]

444
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,040
[Lord Shen and Lady Yan know]

445
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,000
[you have nothing to do with it.]

446
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,520
As long as you stay here,

447
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,400
you'll be safe.

448
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,440
Please, Lord Shen, we beg for mercy.

449
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,840
[Father,]

450
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,560
Mother,

451
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
no matter what happens in the future,

452
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
I'll face it with you together.

453
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,840
Que.

454
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,680
[So,]

455
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,560
[what's really more important,]

456
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,440
[the truth, or the safety of the people]

457
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,520
[around you?]

458
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,720
Who would've thought,

459
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,920
Chen Huo'e again.

460
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
So she didn't come back to life just now,

461
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,560
she has actually never died.

462
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
It's been more than five years.

463
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,960
No matter what Chen Huo'e

464
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
has been planning,

465
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,920
she must believe the timing is right.

466
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,160
That's why she's

467
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
using all the evidence and testimonies

468
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,840
that can prove her resurrection.

469
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,840
What is she really after?

470
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,640
The resurrection as an act of deification,

471
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,680
or even,

472
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,320
the re-investigation of the Jinxiu case.

473
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
Princess Runing was implicated in

474
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case.

475
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,840
[Now that it's reopened,]

476
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,760
[they are using the moth to mislead]

477
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,040
the public and making them think

478
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,800
Princess Ying was behind it back then.

479
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,800
So that means...

480
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,400
To make the most favored royal member,

481
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Princess Ying,

482
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,240
to be suspected,

483
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,200
doubted,

484
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
and even criminalized.

485
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,680
If we want to investigate

486
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,840
the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case thoroughly,

487
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,280
it will inevitably involve

488
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,520
Princess Runing,

489
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,920
Princess Ying,

490
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
Prince Xian,

491
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,800
even the relations between major officials

492
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,520
like Lord Zhang and Lai Luozhi.

493
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,440
If we look at who benefits more,

494
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,760
it is indeed hard

495
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,320
not to suspect that the mastermind behind

496
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,600
is connected to Princess Ying.

497
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,560
Chen Huo'e's act of deification

498
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,760
further misleads the public

499
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
to believe

500
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,240
that Princess Ying

501
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
is the one that needs to be punished.

502
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,640
What is it?

503
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,800
I finally understand now

504
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,920
how much risk and pressure

505
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,360
you need to take to

506
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,640
propose reopening a case.

507
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520
If Princess Ying gets implicated,

508
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,960
how many forces within the court

509
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
will be drawn into this as well?

510
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,920
By the way,

511
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,240
Pan Chi mentioned

512
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,520
another thing this time.

513
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,320
-He said...
-[My lord,]

514
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,360
Princess Ying

515
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,560
is holding a family banquet

516
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,320
and has sent an invitation

517
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,200
inviting you to go.

518
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
At a time like this,

519
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,000
Princess Ying still

520
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,440
has the mood to host a family banquet?

521
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,880
I didn't think she would be this fast.

522
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,520
Since you're curious,

523
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,000
come with me then.

524
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,320
Looks like there are no

525
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,880
other women attending.

526
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,400
Then let's use this chance

527
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,440
to dispel the rumors

528
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,800
of discord between us.

529
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,400
You have a point.

530
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,120
Then

531
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,800
let's show them clearly.

532
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,160
Lord Shen.

533
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,040
Why did Princess Ying

534
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
follow your suggestion

535
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,360
and hold this family banquet?

536
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,960
Given her nature,

537
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,080
she would never allow such rumors

538
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,000
to go unchecked.

539
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,520
She would surely strike first,

540
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,720
trapping her enemies.

541
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,480
Are you that sure

542
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,080
Chen Huo'e will take actions?

543
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,360
If Chen Huo'e wants to

544
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,480
attract more followers,

545
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,320
she must keep creating wonders.

546
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
And punishing the culprit

547
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,760
behind the Jinxiu Silk Workshop case

548
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,360
is the perfect opportunity for her to

549
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,720
prove herself and win people over.

550
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,280
You've always stayed away from factional conflicts,

551
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,800
aren't you afraid that attending

552
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,280
this banquet today would make others think

553
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,960
you're siding with Princess Ying?

554
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
Would the so-called

555
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,680
'the White Death' care about these people?

556
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
My lady, you are very smart.

557
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,960
If Chen Huo'e really shows up later,

558
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,960
what's your plan?

559
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I'll adapt.

560
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,560
[Princess of Jia'an is here.]

561
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,920
Princess of Jia'an.

562
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,520
May Princess of Jia'an be safe and well.

563
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,560
Mother.

564
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
May you be safe and well.

565
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,680
Come here.

566
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,160
This is a family banquet.

567
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
There's no need for too many formalities.

568
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,600
Everyone, enjoy.

569
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,600
Sit down now.

570
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,960
Princess of Jia'an is truly outstanding

571
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,360
[and extraordinary,]

572
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,240
[and as graceful]

573
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
[as the legend says.]

574
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
[You're truly Her Highness' daughter.]

575
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,960
[It's truly an honor]

576
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
to see you today.

577
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,960
[Jia'an has always been frail, so she]

578
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,560
[has grown up in the suburban gardens.]

579
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,000
[And so we]

580
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,400
[have spent little time together.]

581
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Recently she just came of age and was

582
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,760
called back to the city by Her Majesty.

583
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,800
This banquet

584
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,440
is for her,

585
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
to welcome her.

586
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,560
I heard Her Majesty is personally

587
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,240
overseeing the marriage arrangement

588
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,640
[of Zhang Luo, Princess of Jia'an.]

589
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,040
[She'll find you a remarkable husband.]

590
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,480
I, on the other hand,

591
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,160
wish she could stay by my side

592
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,080
a little longer.

593
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,280
Did you notice anything?

594
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
She outshines the stars when she smiles.

595
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,720
She's truly in the prime of her youth.

596
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Look,

597
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,800
all these singing and dancing

598
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,400
are indeed delightful.

599
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,160
Be careful. Every rose has its thorn.

600
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,800
I really hope nothing goes wrong.

601
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,760
A moth.

602
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,960
I saw that.

603
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,760
Look.

604
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,640
Your Highness.

605
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,000
[Guards,]

606
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,280
catch her alive.

607
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,960
Yes.

608
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,440
All that effort you put into this show,

609
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,040
are you really leaving without seeing it?

610
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,560
You got me.

611
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,800
Just some cheap tricks

612
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,680
and you think you can deceive everyone?

613
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,280
[Since you're able to control the moths,]

614
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,040
it's only natural that they will lead me

615
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,400
to you, their master.

616
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,960
[Not bad.]

617
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,840
But,

618
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,240
do you think you can

619
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,000
stop me alone?

620
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,880
It's far from enough.

621
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,240
You're so clueless.

622
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,640
Then today,

623
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,800
I'll make sure

624
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,320
you won't return.

625
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,720
[If you refuse to ally with me,]

626
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,440
[you will be doomed.]

627
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,760
[You won't be able to return.]

628
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,840
Did you have anything to do

629
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,760
with the Shen case back then?

630
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
You father was nothing

631
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,160
more than an ant.

632
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,280
No one would care even if he died.

633
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,040
[How about]

634
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,000
you believe me

635
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,360
and beg me resurrect him?

636
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,320
Your flattering words

637
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,840
are just empty talk.

638
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,240
The person who framed your father

639
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,400
is by your side,

640
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,040
and yet you've sided with him

641
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,160
and assisted in his tyranny.

642
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,120
Shen Du,

643
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,280
you father won't even rest in peace!

644
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Die!

645
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
Could someone that

646
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,760
has come back from the dead bleed?

647
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,880
I've never believed

648
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,040
in resurrection.

649
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
If you kill me,

650
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
there will be one less person

651
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,480
that knows the truth about the Shen case.

652
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,760
Xing, be careful!

653
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,360
[Xing!]

654
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,560
Shen Du,

655
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,000
are you okay?

656
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,040
I've figured out

657
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,760
the secret behind her resurrection.

658
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,480
Let's go.

659
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
[Your Highness,]

660
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
[Princess of Jia'an was terrified.]

661
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,360
She's taken a calming pill and is resting.

662
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,160
Okay.

663
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,200
[Your Highness,]

664
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,440
we caught the culprit.

665
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,880
Lord Shen

666
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,680
really kept his words.

667
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,360
Who sent you?

668
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,000
No one.

669
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,320
Take her out

670
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,800
and torture her until she speaks.

671
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,480
Yes.

672
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
[Today, you all saw it yourselves.]

673
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,520
The Fire Moth Sect

674
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
and their so-called boundless wonders,

675
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
they're nothing more than

676
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,800
a bunch of swindlers

677
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,320
deceiving and misleading the people.

678
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,560
From now on,

679
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,840
anyone who

680
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,400
spreads rumors in the name

681
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,520
of Chen Huo'e

682
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,040
will face the same ending.

683
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,320
Yes.

684
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
[How could you be this careless?]

685
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,080
It was...

686
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,040
It was Shen Du,

687
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,840
and Yan Xing.

688
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,120
They ruined my plan!

689
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,680
After today,

690
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,080
there probably won't be another chance to

691
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,440
get close to Princess Ying's residence.

692
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,880
I will eliminate foes for my lord

693
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,680
without hesitation.

694
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,239
Forget it.

695
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,279
Taking down Princess Ying

696
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:57,160
is no easy task.

697
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:01,239
You fell into Shen Du's trap.

698
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,080
He wanted you to make a move.

699
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,040
As long as you can't punish Princess Ying

700
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,000
like the prophecy says,

701
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,480
you will be used by them and

702
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,880
lose the followers and the public's trust.

703
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,560
No.

704
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,200
I won't let Shen Du get his way.

705
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,040
[All that defy the Fire Moth Sect]

706
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,279
must die!

707
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,640
Very good.

708
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,080
Then go and show your

709
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
miraculous resurrection again!

710
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,800
Stay still.

711
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,880
Next time we see Chen Huo'e,

712
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,320
we must not let her get away.

713
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,800
You want there to be a next time?

714
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Now that we know

715
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,480
she is not immortal,

716
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,760
it would be easy

717
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,880
for you to take her.

718
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,640
So,

719
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,720
news from Pan Chi said that

720
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,840
among the people

721
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,320
the Fire Moth Sect had killed,

722
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,840
there was an old doctor

723
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,120
who once mentioned treating someone

724
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,320
with reversed internal organs.

725
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,480
And from that one sentence,

726
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,320
you deduced that

727
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,640
Chen Huo'e's heart

728
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,680
is different from other people's,

729
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,840
that it's not on the left side.

730
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,480
I wasn't completely sure before.

731
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,240
Until my hands on her,

732
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,440
I confirmed that

733
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,680
her heartbeat was on the right.

734
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,880
[My lord.]

735
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,080
Come in.

736
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,600
The guards watching the Fire Moth Sect's

737
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,440
followers reported that

738
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,320
[there has been some findings.]

739
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,160
What's going on?

740
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,400
[This morning, Chen Huo'e]

741
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,720
[showed up in the east,]

742
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,720
[west, south, and north of the city,]

743
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,240
[claiming that they possess great powers,]

744
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,800
[not only can they resurrect people,]

745
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,400
[but can also create numerous replicas.]

746
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,240
[All of a sudden,]

747
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,520
the people of Xiang'an have all

748
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,080
set up various offerings

749
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
to the fire moth in their homes.

750
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
Looks like the Fire Moth Sect's ambition

751
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,080
goes beyond just their sect.

752
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Pass my order

753
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,720
for a citywide search for Chen Huo'e.

754
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,040
Yes.

755
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,280
Keep an eye on Lady Yan.

756
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,400
Don't let her run around anymore.

757
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,600
Yes.

758
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,120
[Let go of me! Let go of me!]

759
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,760
Take them all to the dungeon!

760
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,600
Yes.

761
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,760
My lord, something's happened!

762
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,360
My lord,

763
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,200
Lady Yan is gone.

764
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,320
She's gone?

765
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,280
Outside,

766
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,040
those thugs from the Fire Moth Sect

767
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,480
are hurting people and causing chaos.

768
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,600
Those people need help.

769
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,360
Open the door.

770
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,440
Lord Shen has instructed before he left

771
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,960
that the door

772
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,280
is not to be opened before he comes back.

773
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,760
If something really happens

774
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,040
to the people outside

775
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,080
today,

776
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
it will put Lord Shen

777
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,200
into a bad position.

778
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,960
Then we really won't be able to

779
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
open the door.

780
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,520
Open the door.

781
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,440
Help them!

782
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,760
[Lady Yan and I went to help the people,]

783
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,520
[but it was a trap.]

784
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,640
Lady Yan was gone

785
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,560
in just a second.

786
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,920
Go look for her!

787
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,880
Let's go.

788
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,200
[Like a moth to a flame,]

789
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,200
[here today and gone tomorrow,]

790
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,440
[Like a moth to a flame,]

795
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,560
[here today and gone tomorrow,]

796
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,520
[The moth resurrected!}

797
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,720
[The moth has manifested!]

798
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,920
[The moth has appeared!]

799
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,800
The moth has manifested!

800
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,160
The moth has manifested!

801

Like a moth to a flame,

802

here today and gone tomorrow,

escaping the cycle of reincarnation,

neither dying nor being reborn.

805

neither dying nor being reborn.

neither dying nor being reborn.

Give up!

827

You dare to pretend to be immortal

with your substitute?

829
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,280
What a joke!
