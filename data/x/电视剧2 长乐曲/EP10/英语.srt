3
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,560
Halt.

4
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Chief Shen,

5
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,400
Lady Shen has instructed that

6
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,240
once we're here,

7
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
all the lights should be put out.

8
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,360
What's your order?

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,760
Kill the lights.

10
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,040
Kill the lights.

11
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,840
Chief Shen,

12
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,880
watch the stairs.

13
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,040
Chief Shen.

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,000
[Clerk Yan]

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
[brought a strange man]

16
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
to my bedroom

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,280
[and has asked me to wait here.]

18
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,040
[Lord Han,]

19
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,080
where have you been hiding

20
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,360
these days?

21
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
[Why are you leaving already?]

22
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,000
Han Shiyuan?

23
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,520
Shiyuan ran away!

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
Are you sure that was Han Shiyuan?

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,120
Yes, it's him.

26
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,440
[He ran away like this the other day too.]

27
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,600
[And he was wearing]

28
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
[the exact same clothes.]

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Yes,

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,560
the exact same clothes.

31
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,440
That day, you were startled

32
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,160
by the fire at Ming Hall, which brought

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
[bright in the east and dark in the west.]

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
[People were walking toward the west.]

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,160
[That day,]

36
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,000
[you didn't get a clear look]

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,480
[at his face that day at all.]

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,400
It wasn't him?

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
But it was definitely him just now.

40
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,920
[It was him too that day.]

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
It wasn't him in the room just now.

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,760
[It wasn't him either that day.]

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
It was his shadow.

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
[That day,]

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,000
[Lan Guizhou used shadows]

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,880
[to create the illusion that Han Shiyuan]

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,280
[was still inside the room.]

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,680
[He then disguised himself as Han Shiyuan]

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,000
[and went out towards the west.]

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,040
[That's when the fire]

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
[from Ming Hall happened in the east,]

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,240
[which produced a strong blaze]

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
[and distracted people,]

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,840
[causing the witnesses]

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,320
[to mistake him]

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
as Han Shiyuan.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,680
You are merely speculating.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
On the seventh of May,

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
it was definitely Shiyuan in the room.

60
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,480
[Then he went out and headed to the West.]

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,920
The problem is,

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,160
both you

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,960
and the scholar

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,280
who had witnessed it outside the room

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,200
[have said that]

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,440
[only Han Shiyuan]

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,000
[came outside.]

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
[You were indoors]

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,840
[with the lights on.]

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,360
[It was bright inside and dark outside,]

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,320
how could you have seen

72
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,720
Han Shiyuan was heading west?

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,360
[Clerk Yan has a point.]

74
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
[When the lights are on inside,]

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,680
[you couldn't see outside.]

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,000
[As for why someone faked]

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
Han Shiyuan was still in Imperial Academy

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,160
on the night of May 7th,

79
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,480
we'll have to ask

80
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,080
his good roommate.

81
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Take him back.

82
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
[You're now dismissed.]

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,080
Apan,

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,600
thank you for today.

85
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,840
It was really nothing.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Don't mention it.

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,280
Who is this Apan?

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,120
Lady Shen is very

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
cheerful with him.

90
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Looks like they're old friends.

91
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Clerk Yan,

92
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,040
I have other matters to attend to today,

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,200
so I'll be leaving then.

94
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
Are you leaving so soon?

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
I haven't had a proper chance

96
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
to thank you yet.

97
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,320
[We will meet again.]

98
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,800
If you need anything in the future,

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,880
come find me at Gui Market anytime.

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,720
Deal.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Is that so?

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,520
Yeah.

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Lady Shen has

104
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
never been this joyful in the residence.

105
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,760
It's all thanks to Apan

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,320
that I can solve this case today.

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,120
You're not taking me to the Imperial
Guard(IG) with you?

108
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,360
There's still the interrogation to do.

109
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,760
[Figure out a way yourself.]

110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,760
What's with him now?

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,000
[Chief Shen, I found it.]

112
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
[Apan's real name is Pan Chi.]

113
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
[He has solved a few cases in Jiangnan.]

114
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
Chief Shen,

115
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,920
do we start the interrogation now?

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,200
Interrogate me

117
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,120
however you want!

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,960
Shut up.

119
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,560
[Lady Shen.]

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,000
How's the interrogation going?

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,120
Lady Shen, you're finally here.

122
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
We were waiting for you.

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
[You could've crawled here by now.]

124
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,720
What are you waiting for then?

125
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
You thought

126
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
after Shiyuan had eloped,

127
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,440
he wouldn't come back again.

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,080
[So you faked his presence]

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
to frame him for the murder.

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
Yes.

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,960
Yeah.

132
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,600
Shiyuan said that he would

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,640
elope with his lover the night of May 6th.

134
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,160
I didn't harm Shiyuan.

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,440
I knew he was leaving.

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
I only wanted to use his name.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,760
But that wasn't

138
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,120
why you killed, was it?

139
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,000
You keep talking about Han Shiyuan,

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,120
but never a word

141
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,800
[about the scholar you killed.]

142
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,440
You haven't told me

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
why you killed yet.

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
Him?

145
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,680
What's there to say about him?

146
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,360
He ruined my poetry anthology.

147
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,000
Didn't he deserve to die?

148
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,680
Just because

149
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
he ruined your poetry anthology,

150
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,200
you killed your classmate?

151
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,760
That poetry anthology meant a lot to me.

152
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,840
Shiyuan

153
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
was my only friend.

154
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
[Ever since Shiyuan got together]

155
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,960
[with Caiwei,]

156
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,480
[I stayed up countless nights]

157
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,240
[copying that poetry anthology]

158
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,720
[as a gift for Shiyuan.]

159
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,200
My poetry anthology!

160
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,720
It's just some worthless copied poems.

161
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,320
Who do you think you are, Pan Yanzhi?

162
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,240
Do you really think

163
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,320
someone would cherish

164
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,680
this foolish poetry anthology as treasure?

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,240
[A pile of useless paper.]

166
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,600
My poetry anthology.

167
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,320
How dare he ruin it!

168
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,240
And he dared to mock me?

169
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,000
You killed someone and

170
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,920
deliberately framed Han Shiyuan for it.

171
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,880
Are you

172
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
secretly hoping

173
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
he'll hear about it and come back?

174
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
[Han Shiyuan went missing as soon as he]

175
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,160
[came back to Xiang'an.]

176
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
You've seen him, haven't you?

177
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,960
[Where are you hiding Han Shiyuan?]

178
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
At Xi market.

179
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,680
In an abandoned distillery warehouse.

180
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,680
[So Lan Guizhou]

181
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,200
has been abusing and killing animals

182
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,160
in this place all along.

183
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,800
His heart is truly twisted.

184
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
No wonder he killed someone

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,560
for just a poetry anthology.

186
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,000
Someone took Han Shiyuan

187
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,680
before us again.

188
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,000
That's the IG's signal.

189
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,640
[It's coming from the Furong Theater.]

190
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,760
[Shen Du,]

191
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,000
can't you just let me

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,480
sit on the horse properly?

193
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,080
Your hand.

194
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,520
Jinglin,

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,280
my legs are a bit numb.

196
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,480
Can you help me?

197
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,040
You're so stubborn.

198
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,680
Stop trying to be tough from now on.

199
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,000
Jinglin.

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
Go save them.

201
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,800
[My...]

202
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,000
My sister is in there.

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
Tell the guards to put out the fire now!

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,680
Something's not right.

205
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,920
Stay put.

206
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
Maybe you can ignore them like this,

207
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,120
but I can't.

208
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,360
If you won't go, I will.

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
Don't go over there.

210
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,720
Watch out!

211
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,800
It's the cold flame.

212
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,200
She's here.

213
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,040
Like a moth to a flame,

214
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,560
here today and gone tomorrow,

215
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,440
escaping the cycle of reincarnation,

216
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,160
neither dying nor being reborn.

217
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,600
I announce to the world,

218
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
[I, Chen Huo'e,]

219
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
am back.

220
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Chen Huo'e?

221
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,160
The serial murderer from five years ago?

222
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,120
Didn't she kill herself in public

223
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,800
five years ago?

224
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,480
People can't come back from the dead.

225
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,040
Such deliberate secrecy,

226
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,240
must be to mislead others.

227
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,640
To think that someone

228
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,960
could remain so calm and composed

229
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
in front of my Nirvana Rebirth Formation.

230
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,920
[You're truly worthy of your name.]

231
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,440
Unfortunately,

232
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,840
even if

233
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,960
you are the White Death,

234
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,040
[you still won't be able to stop me]

235
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,320
from rising from the ashes.

236
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,840
Then I'll just send you

237
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,080
back to hell.

238
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,440
Caiwei.

239
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,840
Caiwei.

240
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Shiyuan.

241
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,560
Caiwei.

242
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Xing.

243
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,280
Chief Shen.

244
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,200
Since Ms. Yang is here,

245
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,800
I assume

246
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
Princess Yong'an

247
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
will be in charge here tonight.

10248
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,720
But Great Grandmother's bodyguards

249
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,520
are also present.

250
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm truly

251
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,120
a bit confused.

252
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,680
Er..

253
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Prince Ying

254
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,360
only asked me to save Han Shiyuan.

255
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,320
[I don't know]

256
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,520
about the rest either.

257
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,960
Chief Shen, Ms. Yang,

258
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,840
[I apologize for being too hasty earlier.]

259
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,160
[I hope I didn't get in your way.]

260
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,760
I was wondering

261
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,240
who could call upon

10262
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,080
[Great Grandmother's bodyguards,]

263
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,960
[turns out it was]

264
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,920
[someone favored by Her Majesty herself,]

265
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,160
Lord Zhang.

266
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,880
[Shiyuan,]

267
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,160
you...

268
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,920
How did this happen?

269
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,960
Are you hurt?

270
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,800
[Are you okay?]

271
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,120
It's okay, it's okay.

272
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,920
As long as you're okay.

273
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
You must remember

274
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,560
to be more careful in the future.

275
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,240
[Don't let yourself]

276
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,360
[get caught in such situations again.]

277
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,200
Chief Shen,

278
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,160
today's event was very unusual.

279
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,880
Thank heavens you're here.

280
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,800
You must tell the Imperial Guards

281
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,120
to be more vigilant in the future.

282
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,000
You must catch

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
the one behind all this,

284
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,520
to prevent further problems.

285
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,439
The IG was already

286
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,679
in charge of this matter.

287
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:40,760
If it weren't for you two's hasty actions,

288
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,720
the culprit would've already been caught.

289
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,360
I was in a rush

290
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,960
and have offended you.

291
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,960
Please accept my apologies.

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
[The reappearance of Chen Huo'e]

293
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,920
[is quite suspicious.]

294
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
We'll have to rely on you,

295
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,280
Chief Shen. to capture the culprit.

296
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,040
I need to return to the palace now,

297
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
so I must take my leave.

298
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,560
Han Shiyuan, Her Majesty

299
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,160
[has asked me to deliver a message:]

300
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
[as long as you are still willing,]

301
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,520
[Her Highness hasn't changed her mind.]

302
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,720
Han Shiyuan,

303
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,320
do you have anything to say

304
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,560
about tonight's matter?

305
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
I know nothing.

306
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
Xing has already cleared you of suspicion

307
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,480
for the murder

308
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,600
at Imperial Academy.

309
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,680
[Tonight,]

310
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,600
[Yan Caiwei and you are victims.]

311
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
If you don't have anything to say,

312
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,760
you should take her back

313
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,520
to Yan residence to rest now.

314
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,400
How is this Han Shiyuan

315
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,520
deeply connected

316
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,320
with both Princess Yong'an

317
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,520
and Zhang Baohuan?

318
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,960
[It's truly surprising.]

319
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,920
Yeah.

320
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,920
Han Shiyuan obviously had known

321
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,040
Zhang Baohuan for a long time and

322
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
had had a history with Princess Yong'an.

323
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,440
But after they saved him,

324
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,920
he showed no gratitude

325
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,920
and almost pretended not to know them.

326
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
There must be a reason behind this.

327
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,040
But it looks like

328
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,280
my sister really

329
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,360
doesn't know anything.

330
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,000
I know.

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I never

332
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,400
meant to make things hard

333
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
for your sister.

334
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,360
I was too reckless

335
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,000
before.

336
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm going to the Ministry of Justice

337
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,360
to check the records later.

338
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,120
Would you

339
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,360
like to come with me?

340
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,760
Yes.

341
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,720
Yes!

342
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,600
C'mon, brothers.

343
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,560
Put two over here.

344
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,040
And put two over there.

345
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,760
At the door.

346
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160

520
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,720
Is this how you apologize?

521
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,360
Why do I need to apologize?

522
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,400
You didn't explain yourself clearly

523
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,320
and made me misunderstand.

524
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,680
Besides,

525
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,720
you've been injured all night.

526
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,120
Didn't you think to

527
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,360
have Jinglin treat it?

528
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,680
You had to wait for me to do it?

529
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,240
I...

530
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,120
[Let go of me!]

531
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:58,960
[Walk!]

532
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
[Let go of me!]

533
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,320
Let go!

534
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,480
Walk!

535
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,240
Let go of me!

536
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,640
Du,

537
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,040
even though you were saving someone,

538
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,840
you still need to pace yourself.

539
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,600
If the arrow had been

540
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,880
even slightly more off,

541
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,400
that man would have surely died.

542
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,080
Father,

543
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,520
I wouldn't have missed.

544
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,640
I intended to leave him alive

545
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,760
for interrogation.

546
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,920
I'm Shen Du.

547
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,400
Are you okay?

548
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,480
[Are you]

549
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,600
[still the boy who saved me]

550
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,440
[that I remembered?]

551
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,800
Who's there?

552
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Yan Xing!

553
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,920
How... How did this happen?

554
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,240
Did you do it on purpose?

555
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,840
Of course not.

556
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,880
I'm sorry, I took the wrong one.

557
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,759
You...

558
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,480
I'll wash it off right away.

559
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,800
Be good.

560
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440
Stay still.

561
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,840
You did do it on purpose.

562
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,160
My lord.

563
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,560
Come, come, Xing.

564
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,240
Have a seat. Have some tea.

565
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,120
[Let's chat.]

566
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,360
Is there any new rumors about me?

567
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,040
[No, no. There isn't.]

568
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,160
No rumors.

569
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
[Right, my lord?]

570
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,200
[However,]

571
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,760
[all of us]

572
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,600
[agree that we have]

573
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,040
a she-demon in the Ministry of Justice.

574
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
And this she-demon

575
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,160
is truly very impressive.

576
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,800
She dares to yell at the White Death.

577
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,080
[But such a pity.]

578
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,040
[In the end,]

579
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,560
she was still hang on the horse

580
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,680
by the White Death

581
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,040
[and paraded through the streets.]

582
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
A woman

583
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,800
should be

584
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,720
gentle,

585
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,200
gentle, virtuous,

586
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,640
gentle, virtuous, respectful,

587
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,320
gentle, virtuous, respectful, thrifty,

588
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,880
gentle, virtuous, respectful, thrifty, and considerate.

589
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,480
It's best for their own good.

590
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,680
Lu Chuichui!

591
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,720
You're late again.

592
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,880
[Why the gloomy look]

593
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,200
[when you're late?]

594
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,080
What were you doing yesterday?

595
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,400
Nothing.

596
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,960
Look at you!

597
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,480
Feng Gui.

598
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,680
My lord.

599
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,040
Last night Chen Huo'e came back from the
dead.

600
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,000
The chief of IG

601
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,720
[had someone send over]

602
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,920
[the records early this morning,]

603
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,520
meaning that this case...

604
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,600
When I came in,

605
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,240
[Ji Fangming, the one in charge of]

606
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,480
[reviewing case files gave this to me.]

607
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:20,720
Give me, give me.

608
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,480
It's a case

609
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,600
from Wannian County.

610
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,080
[There was a murder]

611
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,040
[at Xuanpin Theater, Wannian County.]

612
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,960
The victim

613
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,800
was the wife of Chen Shoujie,

614
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,280
a retired court official.

615
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,000
Such a fuss over the death of a woman?

616
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,160
Chief Clerk Wu, so you mean

617
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,560
only the death of men

618
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,600
matters.

619
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,960
Is a woman's life

620
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,600
not worth taking seriously?

621
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,280
What did I tell you.

622
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,600
She's grown bolder now that

623
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,080
she's married into the Shen residence.

624
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,960
Fine.

625
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,920
Forget I said anything.

626
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,120
Feng Gui,

627
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,680
tell the Delinquents to go investigate.

628
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,120
My lord.

629
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,000
[The case file says that]

630
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,960
[the victim died last night.]

631
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,920
There was a huge, fire-drenched moth

632
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,720
on her shoulder.

633
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,040
Exactly...

634
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,360
Exactly the same as the one

635
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,680
[on the victims of Chen Huo'e]

636
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,280
[from five years ago.]

637
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,640
Chen Huo'e again?

638
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,440
Chief Clerk Wu,

639
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,520
please allow me to investigate this case.

640
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,080
Since this case is connected to

641
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,320
Chen Huo'e coming back from the dead,

642
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,400
we should turn it over to the IG

643
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,240
[for them to handle together.]

644
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,960
[That's right.]

645
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,760
It's not appropriate for the

646
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,960
[Ministry of Justice to get involved.]

647
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,560
That's right. It's not appropriate.

648
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,360
Even though Chief Shen is your husband,

649
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
you have no significance

650
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,200
at the Shen residence.

651
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
[The White Death wouldn't]

652
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
bring you to solve cases together.

653
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
He wouldn't.

654
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,600
[Vice-Chancellor Lai is here.]

655
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,200
[Greetings to Chancellor Lai.]

656
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,040
Chancellor Lai.

657
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,600
If the White Death wouldn't take her,

658
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,760
the Dark Demon

659
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
would gladly invite Clerk Yan

660
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,280
[to assist with the investigation.]

661
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,480
Chief Clerk Wu,

662
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,080
five years ago,

663
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,720
it was me who was in charge of

664
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,040
the Chen Huo'e case.

665
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,920
I've long heard of Yan's skills

666
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,320
in investigations.

667
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,760
Since you're also

668
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,440
interested in the Chen Huo'e case,

669
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,480
why don't you

670
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,320
come work at the II

671
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,720
and help me catch the culprit?

672
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,800
Thank you for your appropriation.

673
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm just a small clerk in this Ministry.

674
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,880
I only hope

675
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,360
to take the female official's exam

676
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,000
and become a ninth clerk.

677
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,960
[I have no intention to change ministry.]

678
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,480
Since you've refused the easy way,

679
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,240
then,

680
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,880
until next time.

681
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,000
Chancellor Lai, take care.

682
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,000
[Halt.]

683
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,360
Greetings to Prince Ying.

684
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,880
Shiyuan,

685
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,120
[we haven't seen each other in a while.]

686
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,720
We met by chance today,

687
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,920
yet you still plan to avoid me?

688
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,440
[I wouldn't dare.]

689
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,160
Shiyuan, what do you mean by that?

690
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,040
Get up.

691
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,040
Your Majesty,

692
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,960
I am just a commoner.

693
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,600
I don't want to offend Your Majesty.

694
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,560
Shiyuan, no need to say such things.

695
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
[Matters of the heart]

696
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,480
[cannot be forced.]

697
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,200
Since you already

698
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
have someone in your heart,

699
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,560
I will naturally support your happiness.

700
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,320
I appreciate Your Majesty's kindness.

701
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,760
Let's go.

702
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,240
Your Majesty.
