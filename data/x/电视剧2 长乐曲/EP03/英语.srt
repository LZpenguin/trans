00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
[For the arson case,]

4
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,960
you've already docked your pay,

5
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
guards got punished,

6
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,640
[and the dead guy]

7
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
[has only an elder left in his family.]

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,760
So,

9
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,560
the case is rested.

10
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,080
[Since you just got married,]

11
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,880
you may skip briefings

12
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,040
for a few days,

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
and spend some time with

14
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,040
your bride.

15
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah.

16
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
I heard you stayed up

17
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,320
all night on the investigation,

18
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,000
[haven't gone home.]

19
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
[Chief Shen is truly devoted]

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
to his duties.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,880
But the bride was alone on the wedding night.

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,560
He should be granted

23
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,320
[a few days' leave as a reward.]

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,600
[Looks like his "devotion" might be]

25
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,280
a front to ignore his bride.

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
[I'm their matchmaker.]

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,800
[But when I checked]

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,160
on the bride this morning,

29
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
she was

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
gone.

31
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,480
[No one in]

[knows where she went.]

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,920
Lady Yan can't just

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
vanish like that after

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,120
[the wedding, can she?]

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
Chancellor Lai.

38
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,600
[How dare you jest]

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
in front of Her Highness?

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,320
Your Highness.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,440
[I was]

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,760
[just being concerned.]

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,680
I heard that

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
Your Highness wanna

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,880
[boost IG's power,]

46
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,680
[which is a good thing.]

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,640
But if Chief Shen can't

48
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,240
even manage his own family affairs,

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,560
how's he gonna handle

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,440
more responsibility?

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Shen.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,120
What do you say?

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Prime Minister Zhang is right.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,040
I'll sort out

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,160
my family business.

56
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm heading home

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,920
to patch things

58
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,320
up with my wife.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,560
I won't let you down.

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,600
Why not wash up?

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Like you

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,440
were working overnight.

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,760
Chief Shen

64
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
didn't come into your bed chamber?

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,320
Is Yan Xing

66
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
your niece?

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
Your Highness.

68
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,880
She's the daughter

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,039
of Madame Jin from the Yan family.

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,359
And Jin

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,600
is my sister.

72
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,800
Don't worry.

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,920
[Shen may seem]

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
[wild and unruly,]

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,480
but he has his principles.

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,920
[He wouldn't do anything]

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,800
truly outrageous.

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,640
Agreed.

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,160
I'll go to the Liang's myself.

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,200
What, you?

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,280
What brings you here?

82
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,640
Chief Clerk Wu,

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,880
I heard there's a case.

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,960
There is one.

85
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,400
But it's none of your business.

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,880
I heard you

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
got married to the

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,040
Shen Mansion yesterday,

89
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,360
but why here

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,680
in your wedding dress?

91
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,160
Did they

92
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,160
kick you out or something?

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,880
You...

94
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,800
She's always

95
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
stirring up problems.

96
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,880
Miss Yan's sharp,

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
and learned a lot from Chen Wen,

98
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
the warden of the prison.

99
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,560
And she has

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
helped us a lot with investigation.

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Right.

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
Mr. Wu and Mr. Xu.

103
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,320
I apologize for my

104
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,280
rudeness.

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,920
I just wanna see if

106
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
there were

107
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,080
any clues left.

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,920
Leave cases to experts.

109
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
As a clerk,

110
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,400
just manage

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,560
the records.

112
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,600
Go back to the Ministry of Justice

113
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,640
and change your clothes.

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,120
Mr. Wu.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,840
Are you just back from the west?

116
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,240
[My Lord.]

117
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,880
Look.

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,840
The blue pattern on

119
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,920
his sleeve is so beautiful.

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
[You see?]

121
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,520
It must be Mrs. Wu's

122
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,000
new stitch.

123
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Good to

124
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,640
be curious,

125
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,960
kid.

126
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,080
Go inside

127
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
and take a closer look.

128
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,640
But don't

129
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,200
interfere with the investigation.

130
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,200
And

131
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,760
stay out of it.

132
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,360
What's going on?

133
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,320
Mrs. Wu can't sew a stitch.

134
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,120
Wu's lackey Feng Gui's

135
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,760
been to the west a lot,

136
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,240
legs all muddy.

137
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
Wu was given a deed.

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
It's most likely

139
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
Wu has a mistress out there.

140
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,240
Mis...

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Let's go.

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm a clerk from the MJ,

143
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,520
can I take a look?

144
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,040
If you're not afraid, go ahead.

145
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
So,

146
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,720
did you spot anything

147
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
weird earlier?

148
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,040
No, nothing.

149
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,640
Heard they

150
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,920
were holding each other

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
tight when dug up.

152
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
[Both]

153
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,760
[hearts gone,]

154
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,800
[bled out.]

155
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,560
[Woman's face scratched,]

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
[but calm.]

157
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
[Man's body was intact,]

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
but his skin was dark.

159
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,080
[The scratches and blood indicated]

160
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,640
[he was scratched after death.]

161
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,480
Despite the weather,

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
[the bodies didn't]

163
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,000
[smell putrid,]

164
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
[but instead emitted]

165
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,840
a fragrance of mixed herbs.

166
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,840
Yan.

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Are you serious?

168
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,760
Fragrance? How's that possible?

169
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,480
[Yan.]

170
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,280
She's right on the mark.

171
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,480
This morning,

172
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,320
a young monk found the bodies

173
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,440
while digging for bamboo shoots

174
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
outside the temple.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,480
We've identified the man

176
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,280
as Liang Chenzhong, the eldest son

177
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,920
of Mr. Liang from the Ministry of Works,

178
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360

No.

183
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,120
What poison

184
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,200
made his skin go dark?

That poison thing...

Your son was poisoned by

[Sorry.]

Farewell, Lord Liang.

what happened.

210
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,280
Right.

211
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
Mrs. Liang's outburst has really

212
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,120
thrown me off balance.

213
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,240
Investigate and

214
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,520
conclude ASAP.

216
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,480
Yes, Sir.

217
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,040
Go.

218
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,720
Get those files

219

back to the Ministry.

220
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,240
I heard the abbot of Ximing Temple

221
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,640
has quite a collection of fine tea.

222

Let's go

223
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,880
and have a taste.

224
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,000
Tea?

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Now? Seriously?

226
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,840
Wu Taiming,

227
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,800
no peace,

228
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,520
just power abuse.

229
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,760
What a jerk.

230
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,240
Yan.

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,360
You've been inspecting the corpse for long enough.

232
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
You should come with me

233

once you're done with it.

234
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,360

You can go ahead.

240
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm gonna head to the pit

241
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,360
for another gander.

242
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,080

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000

[A toxic plant Guanyin?]

It seems you

haven't taken my words to heart.

248
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,720

249

Why are you here instead of

250
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,760
staying at home?

251
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,000
Though I'm married to you,

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,520
still a clerk at the Ministry.

253

How could I not come when

254
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,600
there's a murder case?

255
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,480
You're just

256
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,320
an unranked clerk.

257
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,520
How come you're taking on

the duties of a coroner?

265

I checked it out.

266

Not much blood,

267

just goo.

Liang and Kuang

269
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,800

272
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,280
No cart tracks nearby,

273
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
but plenty of footprints.

274
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,000
With all these pilgrims,

including Prince Ying,

276
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
footprints aren’t gonna help much.

The shovel marks in the pit?

Any idea when?

279
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,160
Few days back,

280
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,040
the coroner says he can't be sure.

281
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
April 15th.

282
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,080
How do you know?

283
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,440
The pit's sides are thin at the bottom,

284
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,920
[thick at the top.]

285
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,920
Sharp points, round edges.

286
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,600
The guy

287
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
used a regular shovel.

288
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,360
Soil's loose around,

289
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,120
but packed in the middle

290
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,440
and bottom.

291
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,240
Looks like it was dug after rain.

292
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,000
[Today is May 8th.]

293

Last rain

294
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,400
was April 15th.

295
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Here you are.

296
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,760
I grabbed this candied fruit

297
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,120
on my way out this morning.

298
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,840
I'll ask the butler

299
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,400
which shop it's from.

300
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,120
So sweet.

301
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,320
Take it.

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,080
Soil's tricky,

303
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,120
your clues might be off.

304
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
See this mark,

305
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
three feet eight inches up?

306
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,880
It's mud

307
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,760
splatter.

308
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,160
Temple's got yellow bamboo,

309
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,040
which can grow

310
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
one to two inches a day after rain.

311
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,280
The mark points directly to the pit

312
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,320
and is thick at bottom, thin at top.

313
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,160
Definitely from that day.

314
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,320
Chen Wen taught you all this?

315
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,320
Darling, I'm very

316
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,600
concerned about you.

317
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,880
I've done my research.

318
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,840
My master said,

319
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,880
catching and

320
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,800
grilling criminals

321
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,840
is our job.

322
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,520
So it's the duty of every official

323
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,800
in the Ministry to do whatever

324
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,400
it takes to crack a case.

325
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,040
You're just

326
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,520
an unranked clerk,

327
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,920
not your place to

328
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,040
worry about cracking cases.

329
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,440
-I...
-Just got married yesterday.

330
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,080
Come back with me

331
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,440
and learn your duties as a wife.

332
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,560
You blew off our wedding night,

333
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,480
now everyone in Xiang'an

334
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,160
knows you're not interested in me,

335
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,240
and frankly,

336
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm not

337
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,960
interested in you, either.

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,160
So from now on,

339
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,480
let's just go our

340
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,440
separate ways.

341
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,760
My duties are none

342
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,880
of your concern.

343
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Seems I have to

344
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
take this matter into my own hands

345
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,680
today.

346
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,760
Shen Du.

347
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,400
Let go.

348
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,560
Shen Du.

349
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,920
Put me down!

350
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
Shen Du. Shen Du.

351
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,400
What

352
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,480
do you want?

353
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,760
The tea here really hits the spot.

354
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,520
Our office tea is nowhere

355
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,480
near this good.

356
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
So unlucky.

357
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,480
I got a wife

358
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,960
who's all about her job.

359
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,240
Gotta sweeten her up at home.

360
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,640
Put me down!

361
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
Nice view.

362
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,080
[What do you want?]

363
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,120
Put me down!

364
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
Be a good girl,

365
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,920
or I'll

366
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,360
kiss you right here.

367
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,280
The...

368
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,360
Yan... Yan Xing?

369
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,880
And the...

370
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Chief Shen.

371
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,800
I heard The White Death

372
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,840
[held a knife to]

373
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,600
his wife's throat on their big day.

374
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
But looks like it's all just gossip.

375
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Now,

376
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,320
you're the

377
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
Mrs. Shen in everyone's eyes.

378
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,480
Once you're in,

379
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,160
there's no turning

380
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,000
back.

381
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
Putting on a show

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
like a clown,

383
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,080
trying to earn a reputation

384
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,760
as a good husband?

385
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,480
Since we're newlyweds,

386
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,880
it's only natural to be intimate.

387
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,680
Today,

388
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,280
I'll make you and

389
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,440
whoever is behind you happy.

390
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,320
IG's got a lot going on,

391
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
sure you have

392
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,200
a lot to handle

393
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,240
for the Great

394
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,400
Grandmother.

395
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,680
I'll just be

396
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,040
in the way.

397
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,720
Are you dead or hurt?

398
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,280
[Boss.]

399
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,520
If not,

400
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,640
what's the big deal?

401
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,960
A message from the palace.

402
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,640
[Wrap the case up quickly,]

403
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,040
[protect Liang Chenyu.]

404
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,640
[No mistakes allowed.]

405
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,560
Gotta go somewhere.

406
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,240
Where?

407
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,280
Liang Mansion.

408
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,040
[What's going on?]

409
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,200
[He's slacking,]

410
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,520
[but I gotta keep digging.]

411
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,320
[Can't just tag along like this.]

412
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,360
Your Excellency. Young Master's

413
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,919
waiting for you in the study.

414
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,080
Your Excellency.

415
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,000
Call me "darling",

416
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,920
or I'll make you

417
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
regret it outside the Liang's.

418
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,360
Darling.

419
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,160
Yes?

420
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Our jobs are different.

421
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,640
You gotta meet Mr. Liang,

422
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,720
I'll just be in the way.

423
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,800
So

424
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,200
I'll just wait outside.

425
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
I just want a stroll.

426
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,640
Fine.

427
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
Jing Lin.

428
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,320
Stay with her.

429
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes.

430
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,520
This way, please.

431
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,600
I've been up all night,

432
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,440
gotta take a nap here.

433
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,240
Watch my back over there.

434
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,160
Fine.

435
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,000
If a guard like you

436
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,440
can stare at me, the wife

437
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,200
of the chief when sleeping,

438
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,000
I aren’t gonna be shy about it.

439
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,680
Whatever.

440
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,280
Mrs. Shen?

441
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,480
What are you doing here?

442
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,200
Here, have this,

443
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,040
it's really sweet.

444
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,720
I heard the Liang's built

445
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
a wall after splitting.

446
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,040
And the trees around here

447
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,280
seem to have been moved recently.

448
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,440
In our culture,

449
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,680
pear, mulberry, and locust trees

450
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,680
are considered unlucky.

451
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,480
Second Madame

452
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,520
had them moved when she was in madness.

453
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,840
Separation.

454
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,640
Something's fishy.

455
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,040
There is a deep grudge between the two brothers.

456
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,520
The word is that

457
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,440
Second Madam's son,

458
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,520
Liang Chenman,

459
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
got poisoned by a toxic plant Guanyin

460
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,600
by Madam Liang...

461
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,560
Don't say that.

462
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,800
But

463
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,960
Second Madame

464
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,760
went crazy after her husband died.

465
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,040
Since then,

466
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,000
the door

467
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
connecting them

468
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,320
has never been opened again.

469
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,800
My lady.

470
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,440
What are you...

471
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,360
Ducking The...

472
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,360
Ducking my husband.

473
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,400
Well.

474
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,600
Since the wedding,

475
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,760
he's

476
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,720
glued to me.

477
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,160
Move a few feet,

478
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,720
he's got his guys on me.

479
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,080
I really need some air.

480
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,720
The Cold...

481
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,600
The chief's so clingy?

482
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,080
I see.

483
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,400
I was wondering.

484
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,000
Mr. Shen visits often,

485
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,960
but this is the first time

486
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,600
he's brought a lady.

487
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
He's been

488
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,520
quite close with the Liang family?

489
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
He's quite close with

490
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,160
Young Master,

491
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,320
and often brings flowers

492
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,280
or herbs

493
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,320
to Second Madame.

494
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,440
[Something's up again.]

495
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,240
[Hurry.]

496
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,520
It's Second Madame.

497
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,840
Her Highness has urged

498
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,360
timely completion of

499
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,240
the crossbow designs,

500
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,280
no delays.

501
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,560
But now,

502
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,040
how can I focus on that?

503
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,800
IG's handling your

504
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,360
brother's case,

505
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,520
so don't worry about that.

506
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,760
But...

507
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,360
Your family's known for

508
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,560
making top-notch crossbows.

509
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,000
Your grandpa designed

510
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
the most of our military gear,

511
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,920
which made us strong on the battlefield.

512
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,760
Now, you're the

513
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,120
only one who can

514
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
keep that up.

515
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,520
The Empress Dowager values you.

516
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
You should focus on getting

517
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,480
those designs done.

518
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,400
Just like before,

519
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,440
whenever my father started drawing,

520
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,160
and your dad would just up and leave.

521
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,600
My dad never forgot

522
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,560
what happened that year

523
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,640
even until his last breath.

524
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,720
Shen Bingzhu confessed his guilt

525
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,960
and deserves punishment.

526
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,680
Forget about it.

527

[Rest assured.]

528
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,520

I'm hungry.

610

614

poison plant years ago,

615
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,120
but she loved it

616
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,360
like a kid,

617
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,440
called it "Chenman".

618
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,320
Now Liang Chenzhong's

619

620
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,000
Crazy coincidence, huh?

621
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,880
No talking while eating.

622
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm done eating.

623
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,520
You think the young master's

624

Deliver it.

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,160
Yes.

629
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,400
Why the rush?

630
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
He should stay for dinner.

631
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,520
You're talking too much.

632
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,880
I eat, drink, talk,

633
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,560
and blink as I please.

634
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,920
Remember,

635
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,440
in Shen Mansion,

636
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
you should pretend you're blind and deaf.

637
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
It's safer.

638
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,560
Liang's case's

639
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,440
been handed over to IG.

640
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,760
It's our Ministry's case.

641
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,520
You're sharp, aren't you?

642
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,880
Can't you figure out

643
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,040
why the Empress Dowager

644
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,160
took the case

645
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,600
away from you

646
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,880
and gave it to us?

647
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,960
She wanna sweep it under the rug?

648
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
Liang's big in the Ministry of Works.

649
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,960
They make almost all

650
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,520
the crossbow designs.

651
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,560
With Liang Chenman

652
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,480
and Chenzhong gone,

653
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,200
if their young master gets

654
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,520
dragged into family feuds,

655
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
who's gonna keep

656
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,560
the skills alive?

657
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,960
You're not as slow as I thought.

658
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,360
The young master can't be put into prison,

659
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,040
unless...

660
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,480
you dare defy Empress Dowager.

661
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,760
Or is this

662
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,800
Zhang Xingwei's order?

663
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,680
I don't work for Zhang.

664
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,720
You left that scroll on purpose,

665
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,240
just to see what I'd do, huh?

666
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,280
Smart move,

667
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,080
or you'd

668
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,560
be dead by now.

669
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,720
I knew it was

670
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,320
bow designs

671
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,000
without even looking.

672
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,720
What are you laughing at?

673
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,400
At you.

674
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,040
As the chief of the IG,

675
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,560
you just jumped

676
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,600
to the conclusion.

677
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,560
But who knows?

678
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,520
She may hate Liang Chenzhong,

679
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,560
but the murderer

680
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,799
only slashed the courtesan's

681
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:33,960
face brutally.

682
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,440
I told you,

683
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,160
this case is none of your business.

684
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,000
What if I insist?

685
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,040
Shut up and live,

686
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,640
or open

687
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,279
your mouth and die.

688
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,680
Your Excellency.

689
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,240
Let's make a bet.

690
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,760
You think I won't kill you?

691
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,840
I don't wanna die.

692
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,720
But you said

693
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm still useful.

694
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,560
You scared

695
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,280
you can't beat me in this bet?

696
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,280
What's the bet?

697
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,080
I'll look into it.

698
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,840
If it's

699
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,560
really Liang Chenyu,

700
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,760
you got me.

701
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,960
I'll ask for a divorce,

702
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,520
and you can do

703
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,400
whatever you want with me.

704
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,240
You're really

705
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,680
asking for trouble, aren't you?

706
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,960
If I crack this case,

707
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,800
we'll split up

708
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,880
in three months.

709
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,400
Neither of us wanted

710
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,320
this marriage.

711
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,440
So let's just

712
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,000
call it quits and

713
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,360
part on good terms.

714
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,960
Fine.

715
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,240
[I'm gotta make it through]

716
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,080
[the next three months.]

717
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,640
[After the exams,]

718
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,800
[my transfer]

719
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,720
[should be set in stone.]

720
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,440
I shouldn't live

721
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,440
in the main chamber, huh?

722
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,720
Do as I say.

723
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
Our marriage is blessed by

724
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,880
the Empress Dowager.

725
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,720
We must appear

726
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,880
loving and

727
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,120
inseparable.

728
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,320
Mess up, and you're...

729
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm dead.

730
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,080
Alright, I got it.

731
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Gotta say,

732
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,200
I feel

733
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,760
quite at home in this room.

734
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,560
Since I'm the wife now,

735
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,320
make sure I get

736
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,560
all the perks that come with it.

737
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,320
Make it a convincing show.

738
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,880
I'm sleeping here.

739
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,000
Where's your spot?

740
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,600
Like you said, huh?

741
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,960
Per

742
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,560
Perks.

743
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,280
As newlyweds,

744
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,760
we gotta stick together like glue

745
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,920
and sleep in the same bed.

746
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,000
With your clothes on?

747
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,240
This is how I roll at home.

748
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,280
If you're not used to it,

749
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,200
deal with it.

750
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,080
You're right.

751
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,520
I suppose I should.

752
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,080
You're squishing my hair!

753
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,000
Gotta say,

754
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,480
the candied fruits are really delicious.

755
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,160
Can't get enough.

756
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,400
So yummy.

757
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,880
Wanna try one?

758
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,280
You...

759
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,120
Zhong.

760
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,440
Get it

761
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,160
Changed!

762
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,920
It's too bright.

763
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,800
Blow it out, will ya?

764
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,400
No.

765
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,400
Can't sleep with it on.

766
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,400
You could stay awake.

767
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,480
[Chi.]

768
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,960
[How's life treating you in Jiangnan?]

769
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,000
[I just cracked a case.]

770
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,120
[A wife was killed by her husband.]

771
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,680
[It's not suicide.]

772
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,400
[Let me walk you through]

773
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
[the scene.]

774
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,080
Yuanniang.

775
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,880
[After strangling Wang Yuanniang,]

776
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,600
[you looped the rope round her neck,]

777
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,040
[dragged her under the beam,]

778
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,400
[hooked the other end]

779
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,480
[up there,]

780
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,640
[and hoisted her up.]

781
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,080
[All that left]

782
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,920
marks on the beam,

783
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,760
[which is why]

784
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,400
[her neck's got]

785
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,800
[two kinds of marks:]

786
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,200
[black ones down,]

787
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,360
[and brown ones up top.]

788
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,760
Plus, you got

789
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,480
rope burns on your hands.

790
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,200
She was strangled by you to death.

791
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,960
Ms. Yan.

792
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,480
Ms. She's already copped to

793
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,880
[helping Cheng Xian]

794
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,360
[kill his wife.]

795
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,520
Yuanniang did the stitching, right?

796
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,680
The coroner checked

797
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,800
and found out

798
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,440
she was carrying a two-month-old baby.

799
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,040
You're lying.

800
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,480
So what if she was

801
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,640
pregnant?

802
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,560
You killed her 'cause you couldn't

803
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,960
handle being married into her family.

804
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,160
But you didn't know

805
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,600
she loved you so much

806
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,680
she wanted the baby

807
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,920
to take your name.

808
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,920
The shirt has your surname

809
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,680
on it.

810
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,200
You blame her family for

811
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,160
oppressing you,

812
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
but you know the real story.

813
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,760
Yuanniang.

814
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,560
I'm so sorry.

815
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,800
[Yuanniang.]

816
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,080
[There's this weird]

817
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,280
[little pin hole on the body,]

818
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,320
[and the coroner]

819
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:00,760
[doesn't know what caused it yet.]

820
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,200
[doesn't know what caused it yet.]

821
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,240
[I've been through]

822
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,040
[many changes lately.]

823
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,560
It's dawn.
