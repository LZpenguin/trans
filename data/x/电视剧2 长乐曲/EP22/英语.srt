[Yijiao,]

7
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,160
you're determined

8
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,040
not to go back with your husband,

9
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,960
[but what future is there for you here?]

10
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
[He came to call me back]

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,640
just for the sake of his family

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,960
or our family's

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
reputation.

14
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,960
[I finally have to return to the]

15
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
[seemingly glamorous yet desolate life. ]

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,920
Why can't I focus on studies

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
and take exams

18
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
to be an offcial like Xing did?

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,840
Even if being just a seamstress,

20
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,680
I can earn a living

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,880
with my own hands.

22
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,120
But if you divorced,

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,480
you would inevitably face scorn,

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
[and the entire family]

25
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,160
[would lose face.]

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,040
[Even your sisters]

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
would be belittled

28
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,880
by their husbands.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,160
Father,

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,360
ever since I was little,

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,720
you've always stressed the importance

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,880
of our family's reputation.

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
It's certainly important,

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,840
but to trade for it

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,160
with Yijiao's lifelong happiness,

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
that's too much of a price to pay.

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
[Recently,]

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,400
[our family has endured many hardships.]

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,680
[But we didn't get through]

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,600
[any of them by relying on reputation.]

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
My dear,

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
please sit.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
[Father,]

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Shiyuan certainly would never

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,040
think less of me

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
because of Yijiao's divorce.

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm sure Lord Shen

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,800
wouldn't look down on Xing

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,880
because of this either.

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
[As long as our whole family]

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,480
[doesn't think less of Yijiao,]

52
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
[then who else would look down on her?]

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,760
Caiwei is right.

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,400
My dear,

55
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,840
now that we've finally

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,680
found a peaceful life in Xiang'an

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,680
as a family,

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
[why sacrifice the children's happiness]

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,240
for the sake of

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,840
our reputation?

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,880
A father doesn't control a grown daughter.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
You decide for yourself

63
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,200
what to do with the future.

I only came here to...

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,280
You should sit

83

on the groom's side.

84

of course, the groom's side.

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,560
When does the wedding start?

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Xing,

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,520
did your father really agree

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
to Yijiao's divorce?

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
It's rare for him to put his children's

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,160
affairs ahead of his reputation like this.

94
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
That's great!

95
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,880

when you get a divorce,

97
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920

but you wouldn't.

103
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you think the White Death

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,200
will give you a hard time then?

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,400

when Xing was

119

poisoned by Chen Huo'e,

120
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,960
it was me who gave her the antidote.

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,800
I basically saved Xing's life.

122
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,640
So why can't I come to this wedding

123
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
and have a toast?

124
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
Of course

125

176
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
At first,

177
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,480
it seems truly terrifying.

178
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
But upon closer reflection,

179
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,720
I find it shares similarities with

180
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,640
[the Chen Huo'e case.]

181
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
Trickery

182
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,840
and fear-mongering.

183
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,680
Your Highness, you're as wise as ever.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,320
Rumors spread when the truth is unclear.

185
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,480
[I believe the priority]

186
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,240
[is to send capable individuals]

187
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,720
to Gannan at once

188
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,880
to help Mo Qianzhi

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
find out the truth

190
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
and stop the rumors.

191
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,520
Wan,

192
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,680
then who do you think

193
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,280
would be most suitable?

194
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,600
Your Highness, perhaps

195
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,680
you have already decided.

196
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,400
You...

197
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,400
Your Highness,

198
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,440
they're here.

199
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
- Shen Du.
- Yan Xing.

200
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

201
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,440
Mr Shen.

202
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,520
Mr Shen,

203
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,440
[did you see?]

204
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,400
Someone is trying to exploit

205
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,080
the panic in Gannan

206
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,320
to incite chaos again.

207
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,040
[I remember]

208
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,880
Mo Qianzhi, the magistrate of Yingzhou,

209
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,280
and you have a past.

210
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,680
[Therefore,]

211
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
[I'm sending the two of you]

212
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,400
to Gannan to investigate

213
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
the half-faced ghost eating people case.

214
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,200
I accept your order.

215
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,880
Clerk Yan, please wait a moment.

216
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,000
Bring the brocade jacket to Clerk Yan.

217
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,760
Bring it here.

218
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,560
Her Highness

219
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,120
knows that you're going to Ganna for cases

220
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,800
shortly after getting married,

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
has specially ordered me to prepare

222
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
some windproof brocade robes

223
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,640
for you to choose from.

224
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,280
This is?

225
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,680
This is a secret decree

226
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,720
from Her Highness.

227
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,160
Open it.

228
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,000
[Clerk Yan,]

229
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,160
do you remember when I asked you

230
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,800
what you wanted for a reward?

231
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,520
Your Highness, I only wish

232
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,920
to be addressed as Clerk Yan

233
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,240
instead of Lady Shen.

234
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,560
You wanna be known as a female clerk

235
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,840
of the Ministry of Justice,

236
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,440
instead of Lady Shen.

237
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,080
My request today is for you

238
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,320
to carry out your responsibilities,

239
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,720
[serving the Ministry,]

240
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,200
[and me.]

241
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,400
Clerk Yan,

242
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
do you understand?

243
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,120
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,760
I accept your order.

245
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,160
[Supernatural occurrences]

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,680
[are bothering Gannan.]

247
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,480
I fear that Magistrate Mo of Yingzhou

248
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,760
might have treacherous intentions,

249
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
[thus command you to secretly investigate]

250
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,320
his actions and

251
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,520
see if he has any alliances in the court.

252
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,160
[You can send report when seeing the]

253
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,800
[red-feathered carrier pigeon.]

254
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
[Did Her Highness issue the secret decree]

255
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
['cause the accomplice she suspects]

256
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,720
[to be is none other]

257
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,680
[than Shen Du?]

258
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,320
[Did she give this order solely to me]

259
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
['cause she's figured out our marriage]

260
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,440
[is a sham or is she testing me?]

261
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,920
What are you laughing at?

262
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,320
The brocade robes from Shazhou

263
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,959
are known for the exquisite embroidery.

264
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,120
I wonder

265
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,520
why you took so long

266
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,760
to choose this one.

267
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,280
It's truly a waste

268
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,640
of Her Highness's generosity.

269
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,000
Such embroidery

270
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,840
is everywhere in Xiang'an.

271
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,840
Her Highness rewarded it to me.

272
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,080
As long as I like it.

273
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,360
In my opinion,

274
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,040
this design is simple and tasteful.

275
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,240
Overdecorating it with embroidery

276
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,680
would rather be tasteless.

277
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,640
Okay, fine.

278
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,160
Since it's a reward for you,

279
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,800
as you wish.

280
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
[If Mo Qianzhi truly had ill intentions,]

281
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
[what would Shen Du do then?]

282
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,760
I was just curious

283
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
why my apprentice

284
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,920
suddenly

285
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,760
invited me for tea.

286
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,400
I got it.

287
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,920
You wanna know

288
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,240
the story of Mo Qianzhi of Yingzhou.

289
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,160
You should ask your

290
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,920
husband about this.

291
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,200
That would be

292
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,520
easier to do than asking me.

293
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,520
Why's that?

294
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,080
Mo Qianzhi

295
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,320
was the most beloved student

296
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
of Shen Du's father,

297
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,320
Shen Bingzhu.

298
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
No wonder.

299
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,160
So they've known each other for long.

300
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
More than that.

301
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,600
Mo Qianzhi

302
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
had great potential

303
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
and a bright future

304
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,480
until the major scandal of the Shens.

305
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,680
He risked his life to plead for Lord Shen,

306
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,920
helping Shen Du outta being killed

307
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
but to the Custodial Ward.

308
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,360
But he himself was sent to the frontier

309
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,600
and lost any chance for promotion.

310
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,880
Such a pity.

311
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,560
Truly.

312
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,440
Are you here to see me

313
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,400
'cause he's involved

314
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
in some case?

315
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,480
You know,

316
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,080
even though I'm retired,

317
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,520
I still have a knack

318
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,760
for analysis.

319
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,760
You're worried that

320
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,520
in investigating one man,

321
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,640
another closer to you

322
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,600
might get involved.

323
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,200
Did I guess right?

324
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,000
Master,

325
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,440
I still have much to learn.

326
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,560
When uncovering the truth,

327
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
you'll inevitably go through

328
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,240
what you're experiencing now.

329
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,480
No matter how small the detail

330
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,480
or how close the person,

331
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,480
the first thing is not to fear suspicion

332
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,840
but to have the courage to verify it.

333
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,120
Trust,

334
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,560
can also be a driving force

335
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,560
in pursuing the truth.

336
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,240
Okay, okay.

337
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,160
Now you know all that you wanted to know,

338
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,240
why don't you pour me another cup of tea?

339
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,600
Okay, master.

340
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,560
That's more like it.

341
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,200
Thanks.

342
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,960
Shen Du is going to Gannan?

343
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
But the things there...

344
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,040
[My Lord, don't worry.]

345
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,760
They've already been cleared up.

346
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,720
Alright,

347
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,840
let him go.

348
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
He might just

349
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
cause his own downfall.

350
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,920
But the letter

351
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,560
from the Imperial Secretariat has gone.

352
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,160
What?

353
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,680
Gone?

354
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,240
I've checked,

355
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,080
it's truly missing.

356
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,080
[Moreover,]

357
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,840
[it vanished around the same time]

358
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,600
[as the Imperial Academy exams,]

359
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,600
right after Lord Shen

360
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
took over the Capital Guards.

361
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,360
Shen Du,

362
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,280
could it be

363
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,960
that you intend to

364
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,800
reopen and overturn

365
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,720
the case of your family?

366
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,880
[Quickly, quickly.]

367
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
[Be quick!]

368
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,520
I've almost prepared all

369
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,960
you asked for,

370
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,600
except for those

371
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,160
that I just couldn't find.

372
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,920
However,

373
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,680
I still managed to find them

374
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,040
from my father's pawn shop.

375
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,040
How could your father agree?

376
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,960
No worries.

377
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm his precious daughter.

378
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,760
Of course he would agree.

379
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,440
Oh right,

380
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,240
Xiangren is unable to see you off

381
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,400
due to the task at hand.

382
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,480
He asked me to remind you

383
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,320
to keep the token

384
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,560
he gave you safe.

385
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,160
If anything happens,

386
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,720
you can ask

387
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,160
for help from the Delinquents there.

388
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,440
Gosh,

389
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,240
I almost forgot.

390
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,440
Your dear friend Chichi's letter

391
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,520
was delivered to the Ministry of Justice.

392
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,240
Let me see.

393
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Chichi said

394
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
she's already on her way to Yingzhou.

395
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,600
[That's perfect.]

396
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,960
I can bring all the gifts

397
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,840
I've prepared for her.

398
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,080
[Master,]

399
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,120
all those rare items you wanted

400
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,840
are here.

401
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,760
[Am I good or what?]

402
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,800
Eh,

403
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,200
all good. We should leave now.

404
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,080
- Take care.
- Master...

405
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,480
Goodbye.

406
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,760
Have a safe journey.

407
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,160
What are these rare items

408
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
even for?

409
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,880
They are all from my friends.

410
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,720
Friends?

411
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,840
They're making such a fuss?

412
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,560
We're only traveling with one cart

413
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,400
and the space is limited.

414
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,480
Let's travel light

415
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,360
and leave behind anything

416
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,280
unnecessary.

417
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,960
[My Lord, don't worry]

418
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,760
[about the cart.]

419
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,320
I just arranged for two more.

420
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,120
No matter how much luggage Her Lady has,

421
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,840
there's enough space.

422
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,440
This is a business trip,

423
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,000
not a social gathering.

424
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,560
Bring only the essentials.

425
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,480
These are all!

426
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,520
[Xing.]

427
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
Lord Shen.

428
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,840
Xing,

429
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,240
[I brought you something.]

430
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
Medicine for injuries,

431
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,440
salted pork and fish,

432
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,760
[and something from Caiwei and your dad.]

433
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,800
C'mon, Mom.

434
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,320
We only have one cart this time.

435
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,240
The space is limited.

436
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,440
We can only bring the essentials.

437
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,320
You don't have enough carts?

438
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,880
You father has one.

439
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,160
We can bring it here right now.

440
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,880
No need for that.

441
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,440
Jing Lin.

442
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,040
Yes.

443
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,640
Where are the other carts you just said?

444
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,840
I...

445
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,880
Should be here soon.

446
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,680
I'll go check.

447
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,080
Let's go.

448
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,480
Didn't he just say no to any new carts?

449
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,640
As I said, he speaks his way

450
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,560
and thinks another.

451
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,240
[You know, this job]

452
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
[was not easy.]

453
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,960
Let's go.

454
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,200
[Xing,]

455
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
[the frontier is harsh.]

456
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,280
[And this is your first time]

457
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,480
[you've embarked on such a long trip.]

458
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,920
You must be careful.

459
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,720
Don't you ever

460
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,600
pull a stunt!

461
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,440
Safety first!

462
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,680
Mom,

463
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm going there for a case,

464
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,560
not a war.

465
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,800
[Remember,]

466
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,800
you must

467
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,880
take care of yourself.

468
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,440
And

469
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,880
tell Father

470
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
to dodge court disputes.

471
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
The farther, the better.

472
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,040
No matter what,

473
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,560
wait till we get back.

474
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,560
If you need anything,

475
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,600
remember to send a letter.

476
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,400
I know.

477
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,920
You don't have to

478
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,200
worry about things at home.

479
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,160
[But you know,]

480
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,960
[Far water does not put out near fire.]

481
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
if got into any trouble,

482
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,000
you should help each other.

483
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,920
Don't worry, My Lady.

484
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,000
I will take care of Xing.

485
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,520
Good then.

486
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,160
You're awake.

487
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,320
You were sleeping

488
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
so deeply that I thought

489
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,920
you could sleep all the way to Yingzhou.

490
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,600
I...

491
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,480
I just didn't sleep well last night.

492
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm not usually like this.

493
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,800
[The scenery outside the city]

494
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,320
[is indeed different from Xiang'an.]

495
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,480
My Lady, what do you need?

496
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Nothing, nothing.

497
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,600
I was just looking at the views.

498
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,680
Can I read it?

499
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,320
Halt.

500
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,200
You stand guard.

501
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,800
All of you, turn around.

502
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,440
Yes.

503
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,680
If you don't feel well,

504
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,600
you need to tell me.

505
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,800
Thanks.

506
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,160
I'm just afraid that you would throw up

507
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
in my carriage.

508
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,800
I will be more careful.

509
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,280
But the IG's carriage

510
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,200
is truly poorly driven,

511
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,320
making constant turns.

512
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,600
Since leaving the city,

513
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
we've been closely watched.

514
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,800
[If we hadn't changed lanes quickly,]

515
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,520
[how could we've shaken off the spies?]

516
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,640
[Spies!]

517
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,600
Northwestern woods.

518
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,280
Switch lanes quickly.

519
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,160
Yes, sir!

520
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
[I didn't realize there're]

521
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,960
so many people watching us on this trip.

522
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,480
This trip to Yingzhou

523
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,040
probably won't be that easy.

524
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,080
Imperial guards, carriage team,

525
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,280
stick to the planned route.

526
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,200
Meet us at Shanyang

527
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,160
after you've shaken off all the spies.

528
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,480
Remember what I said,

529
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,360
no one is to

530
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,000
disturb their rest.

531
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,800
Don't worry.

532
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,800
My Lord, My Lady,

533
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
the room is ready.

534
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
After you finish your meal,

535
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,680
you can go to your rooms and rest.

536
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,880
Jing Lin,

537
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,280
the luggage is still not here?

538
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,600
My Lady...

539
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
the luggage cart is going to be late

540
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,560
for about half an hour.

541
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,720
My Lord,

542
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,040
Her Lady's luggage

543
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,880
is filled with medicinal ingredients

544
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,800
for you.

545
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,080
You mean,

546
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,280
all those large boxes are filled

547
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,160
with kinda medicinal material?

548
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,120
Yeah.

549
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
They're collected by her

550
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
from different regions.

551
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,360
She probably knew you wouldn't eat them

552
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,320
[and wouldn't agree to bring them, so she]

553
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,280
[didn't tell you on purpose.]

554
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,160
Who's there?

555
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,680
Come here.

556
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Master.

557
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,960
Help!

558
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,480
Help me!

559
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,400
[Qi Yeyun?]

560
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,440
You finally arrived!

561
00:33:59,440 --> 00:33:59,960
Or he would have

562
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,200
snapped my neck!

563
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,080
Let me see.

564
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,520
[Shen Du,]

565
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,920
doing that to a kid?

566
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,080
You are too harsh.

567
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,680
What kid sneaks around

568
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
in front of people's room

569
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,600
in the middle of the night?

570
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
He must be either a thief or a spy.

571
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,440
Weren't you pacing in front of

572
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,160
[a room in the dead of night,]

573
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,160
[making noise that bothered me?]

574
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,960
Are you a thief or a spy too?

575
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,560
I just ate too much at dinner

576
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,520
and needed to digest.

577
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,279
Jing Lin!

578
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,680
Is this how you got rid of the spies?

579
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,600
Even a child was able to follow us.

580
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,120
It's my fault.

581
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,040
I didn't follow you all the way here.

582
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,480
[I only followed you]

583
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,359
[out of the city]

584
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,160
[and sneaked in the carriage]

585
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,759
[while no one was watching.]

586
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,279
[I hid in the cabinet under]

587
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,160
[the carriage seat]

588
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,319
[and brought here.]

589
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:00,080
[Master,]

590
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,960
am I qualified

591
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,880
to be your apprentice now?

592
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,319
[I want to learn from you]

593
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,120
and become a great detective

594
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,960
like you.

595
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,400
Master,

596
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,600
please take me in.

597
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,520
[Stop, stop.]

598
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,240
Don't call me that.

599
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,720
Xing is okay.

600
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,960
[Learning skills takes time.]

601
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
Since you already followed us here,

602
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,360
just stay.

603
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,000
[Then go back]

604
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,240
[to Xiang'an together with us.]

605
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,080
Thank you, Xing.

606
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,360
Jing Lin,

607
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,680
are there any spare rooms?

608
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,080
Yes.

609
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,880
I'll go arrange it now.

610
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,720
Jing Lin,

611
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,480
who told you to do that?

612
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,000
You're right.

613
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,120
We're

614
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,880
both appointed

615
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,680
by Her Highness to this case.

616
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,840
[What?]

617
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,800
I don't even have the right

618
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,680
to arrange a room

619
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,480
for a companion?

620
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,960
Du,

621
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,560
[I don't have to have a room.]

622
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,160
As long as you let me stay with you,

623
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,760
I'll even sleep in a barn or on the floor.

624
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,800
What

625
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,400
did you just call me?

626
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,240
Du.

627
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,880
[I was asked]

628
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,280
[to call her]

629
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,400
[Xing.]

630
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,800
Such being the case,

631
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,240
shouldn't I call you Du?

632
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,080
Is that not true?

633
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,480
If you...

634
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,560
don't like it,

635
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,880
how about Mr Shen?

636
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,040
Or Lord Shen?

637
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,400
I don't like any of them.

638
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,480
This is an official mission.

639
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,640
We don't have room for idlers.

640
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,760
And your small frame

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,960
won't handle heavy work.

642
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,000
Jing Lin.

643
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,400
Yes.

644
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,960
I'll chase this idler

645
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
out of the inn now.

646
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,560
Who told you to do that?

647
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,840
From now on,

648
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
he'll live with you.

649
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
- I...
- This way you can also train him,

650
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,560
so he's not just idling around.

651
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,320
What?

652
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,200
Shut up.

653
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,080
Is it that hard for you to handle a kid?

654
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,320
I accept your order.

655
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,040
Boy,

656
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,840
please.

657
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,200
Du,

658
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,520
don't!

659
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,600
[I don't want to train!]

660
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,960
How come

661
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,680
the courthouse hall is empty

662
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,920
in the middle of the day?

663
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,200
Lord Shen is coming.

664
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,440
Is there no one stationed

665
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,600
at Yingshou Prefecture?

666
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,680
[Greetings from Bi Qiu]

667
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,280
[of the Bureau of Yingzhou.]

668
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,400
I didn't know you were coming.

669
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,240
I apologize.

670
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,040
Never mind.

671
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,800
Where is Magistrate Mo?

672
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,760
[Sir,]

673
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,160
Magistrate Mo is out working on a case.

674
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,040
I already sent someone for him.

675
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,880
[He'll be here soon.]

676
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,640
[Magistrate Mo is coming.]

677
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm Mo Qianzhi.

678
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,280
I apologize for not greeting you properly.

679
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,760
Please forgive me.

680
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,920
[Magistrate Mo,]

681
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,840
were you on a case earlier

682
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,960
and have been in contact with corpses?

683
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,480
How did you know?

684
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,280
Those who deal with corpses frequently

685
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,280
tend to show it.

686
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,520
You

687
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,000
must be

688
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,480
the renowned Clerk Yan

689
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,440
from Xiang'an.

690
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,120
Clerk Yan, your keen observation

691
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,920
is very admirable.

692
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,600
Xiang'an is very far from Yingshou.

693
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,680
Clerk Yan, as a woman,

694
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,200
the trip must have been

695
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,480
hard on you.

696
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,000
Thank you for your concern.

697
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
The journey went well.

698
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,320
I'm fine.

699
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,640
Qianzhi,

700
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,880
how have you been?

701
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,040
Mr Shen,

702
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,800
you're too polite.

703
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
I apologize.

704
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,800
[Since cases piling up,]

705
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,040
I didn't have time

706
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,560
to prepare a welcome banquet for you.

707
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,040
[It's all for the people.]

708
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,800
[Why don't we work on the case first?]

709
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,920
The sooner we solve it,

710
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,400
the sooner the people will be reassured.

711
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,840
What do you think?

712
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,960
How can that be?

713
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,040
Lord Shen has traveled a long way.

714
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,360
Even if there's no welcome banquet,

715
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,760
[you should've at least]

716
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,920
[prepared some tea.]

717
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,360
[You didn't do neither of these.]

718
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,120
[Isn't that]

719
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,360
disrespectful to him?

720
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,360
It's okay.

721
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,040
We did come for the case,

722
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,360
not for pleasure.

723
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
The sooner we close it,

724
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,600
the sooner we can

725
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,720
return to Xiang'an to report.

726
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
[Jing Lin,]

727
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,000
take Yeyun to get something to eat first.

728
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,120
Clerk Yan and I will go work on the case.

729
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,240
[Yes, sir.]

730
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,040
Mr Jing,

731
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,880
please follow me.

732
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,480
[Mr Shen,]

733
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,920
these are the files.

734
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920
It's a corpse without the head.

735
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,200
[Be cautious not to be scared.]

736
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,800
She's not easily scared.

737
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,160
Don't underestimate my wife.

738
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,480
The victim's name is Li Kaixiang.

739
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,040
The suspect is his brother, Li Kairui.

740
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,080
They got into an argument after drinking.

741
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Li Kairui passed out

742
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,400
after drinking a lot.

743
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
[When he woke up,]

744
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,280
[he found his brother's]

745
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,240
[head missing.]

746
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,400
We still haven't found it.

747
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,320
Did you find anything?

748
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,160
Judging from

749
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,840
the coagulation of the blood,

750
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,480
he must have been alive when

751
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,720
his head was cut off.

752
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,280
Decapitated alive?

753
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,680
Currently,

754
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,920
there're only two possibilities.

755
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,040
The first is,

756
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,760
the victim was

757
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,040
passed out when killed

758
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,840
with a single fatal blow.

759
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,320
The other is that,

760
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,800
the killer is an expert.

761
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,000
The victim was

762
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,560
not a match for the killer

763
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,880
[and thus was decapitated.]

764
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,480
[However, I just checked]

765
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,760
his skin.

766
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,960
No bruises at all.

767
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,640
I also examined his abdomen

768
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,080
and found no internal injuries,

769
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,560
which largely

770
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,920
rules out the second possibility.

771
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,040
That is a remarkable analysis.

772
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,240
[Great minds think alike.]

773
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,760
The Ministry of Justice's top female

774
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,960
detective truly lives up to her name.

775
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,720
Chi,

776
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
why are you here?

777
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,360
Ms Yan,

778
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,400
long time no see.
