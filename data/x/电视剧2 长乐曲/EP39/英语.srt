3
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,720
Now,

4
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,400
this is getting much more interesting.

5
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,120
Lai Luozhi,

6
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,440
right here in the imperial court,

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,200
your insolent actions defy

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,960
all sense of propriety,

9
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,160
a betrayal of your duty as a subject!

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,200
The emperor is utterly incapable.

11
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,920
The realm is in disarray.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
Chancellor Lai

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,560
has been devoted to the empire.

14
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,160
If he is facing injustice,

15
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,080
we will not tolerate it!

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,040
You betray your loyalty and honor.

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,240
You treacherous ones!

18
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,879
How dare you speak so brazenly!

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,600
A woman's seizure of the throne, now

20
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,600
that is the true calamity of the empire!

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Excellent!

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,160
The traitors have all revealed themselves.

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,480
Now I shall see,

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
who exactly are the

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
true calamity of the empire!

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Guards!

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Why not let me give it a go?

28
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,480
Guards!

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Look closely,

30
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,760
these are our

31
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Palace Guards!

32
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
I have long heard that the Imperial Guard

33
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,040
and the Imperial Inspectorate

34
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,240
are in collusion.

35
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,240
To my surprise, the Palace Guards

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,960
have also allied with Lai Luozhi.

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
Her Highness' been ill for quite some time.

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,840
Perhaps she has become a bit muddled.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,240
What needs to be said,

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
what actions to take,

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,120
I still have to remind her of it.

42
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,120
Does Your Highness truly have nothing

43
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
to address the officials?

44
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,360
Lai Luozhi,

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,200
bringing troops to besiege the palace,

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,560
your ambition to usurp is evident!

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
God's decree is clear,

48
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,200
It truly reflects the will of the people!

49
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,280
Lai Luozhi,

50
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,240
this is outrageous!

51
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,920
Who would have imagined,

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
the Empress Dowager would actually

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,920
be determined to fight to the bitter end.

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Alas, it was

55
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,360
unnecessary for it to come to this.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,519
Now that it has come to this,

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,400
you surely understand

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,880
how to draft

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
the abdication edict, don't you?

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Preposterous!

61
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
What qualifications do you possess

62
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
to inherit the throne?

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
What if I do possess such qualifications?

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,640
You should accept the mandate of heaven,

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,440
and uphold the ultimate authority!

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,720
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing,

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,960
their true intentions are malicious!

68
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,760
Enough of this noise!

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
Drag these stubborn individuals

70
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,160
out of my sight!

71
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,680
Rip out their tongues!

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,560
Shen Du.

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
What are you waiting for?

74
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,800
Aspiring to the throne?

75
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,440
Delusional!

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,840
Stand by for further instructions!

77
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,840
I, Shen Du of the Imperial Guard

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,440
have scrutinized the Palace Guards

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,280
[and eliminated the conspirators.]

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
[I'll lead the forces to defend the]

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,480
sovereign and seize the traitors!

82
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,160
The Shen Family has suffered

83
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,400
the loss of dozens.

84
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,640
Do you not wish

85
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
to avenge their deaths?

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Think of your father, Shen Bingzhu;

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
do you not want to restore his honor?!

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,760
I will uncover the truth myself,

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,640
and bring justice back to the Shen Family!

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,320
You are unworthy to stand

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,840
as my brother-in-arms!

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,440
So,

93
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,240
you suspect that

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
the Fire Moth Sect has secretly

95
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,400
thrived and expanded over the years

96
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,400
with the aid of someone within the court,

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,680
and that someone

98
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,920
is most likely Lai Luozhi?

99
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,280
While there is no concrete evidence,

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,800
the signs strongly suggest

101
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,720
that Lai Luozhi

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
is involved.

103
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
They are eyeing the supreme authority,

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,680
attempting to manipulate the weaknesses

105
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,280
of Princess Ying and others,

106
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,760
stirring up royal conflicts.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
It's clear that the mastermind behind this

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,320
is deeply concealed.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
And he's even scheming grander schemes!

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,000
He's bold enough to tamper with

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,280
the court-regulated cinnabar;

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,600
Your speculation

113
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,440
is highly likely to be accurate.

114
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,360
What are your thoughts?

115
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
The enemy lurks in the shadows.

116
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,120
It would be wise to seize the opportunity

117
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,480
and lead them into a trap.

118
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
Lead them into a trap?

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
Very well.

120
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,320
I shall see,

121
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,000
what results

122
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,920
your trapping will yield!

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Your Royal Highness,

124
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Shen Du has gone to

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,360
great lengths to obtain this

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,440
rare medicinal herb from the Jinwu Tribe.

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,360
He discreetly arranged for its delivery,

128
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
claiming it's effective for your condition.

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,920
Please take it; you will be well

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
in just half a month.

131
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,000
[A clever tactic to maneuver in secrecy.]

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,120
You feigned loyalty to me,

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,600
even risking your own life

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,480
and those around you!

135
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
Instead of claiming I lured

136
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,400
you into confusion,

137
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,640
it's your overconfidence that walked you

138
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,200
into the carefully planned pitfall

139
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
There's no point in further discussion.

140
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,280
The victor remains to be seen!

141
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
The fire moth rises,

142
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,680
revealing the truth!

143
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
These envoys are impostors!

144
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,400
I have never fully trusted you either.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,120
Now six Imperial Legates

146
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
have all pledged their loyalty to me.

147
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,960
Just moments ago,

148
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
they surrounded the palace.

149
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,440
What do you have to fight against me?

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,560
The tide has turned against you.

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,880
You may regret it now,

152
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
but it's too late!

153
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
Shen Du,

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
you could have been the first among

155
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
my dynasty's founding heroes.

156
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,640
Alas.

157
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,480
Leave no one alive!

158
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
Kill them all!

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,280
Everything will be fine.

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,840
I will protect you.

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,160
You will surely ascend...

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,080
To the throne.

163
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,840
You will, without a doubt.

164
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,520
I won't let your death be in vain.

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
General Zhenyuan, you've mobilized

166
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
your troops with remarkable speed,

167
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
swiftly restoring order.

168
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,440
You truly are the greatest general

169
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,360
defending our empire's borders!

170

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,080
[has placed all counties]

177
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,160
[under surveillance.]

178
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,960
[Only one man can turn the tide.]

179
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,720
[To avoid alarming the enemy,]

180
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
[I hope Your Highness will personally]

181
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,400
[intervene to alleviate the plight of Xiang'an]

182
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
[and quell the unrest in the empire.]

183
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Thanks to Your Highness' covert letter;

184
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I was alerted to the presence of

185
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,760
traitors in our midst.

186
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,280
It seems that some within the court

187
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,160
are in league with the enemy, scheming to

188
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
create turmoil at the border to pin me down.

189
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,360
He would never have imagined

190
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,720
that an elite legion

191
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,160
had already set off for Xiang'an!

192
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
Lai Luozhi may have been persuasive,

193
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
but he neglected to see that

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,880
the palace

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,760
is home to my family,

196
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,160
with His Majesty being

197
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
my very flesh and blood.

198
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,080
Now, more than ever, as a subject

199
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,240
of the empire, we must stand

200
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
united with our nation and the people.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,040
We have an endless number of disciples.

202
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,840
Spanning the entire empire,

203
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
all branches of the Fire Moth Sect

204
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,280
are rising up in unison with me today.

205
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,520
How do you plan to counter this uprising?

206
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you intend to have all the citizens

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,480
of Xiang'an perish alongside you?

208
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,520
Lord Shen, the rebel forces outside

209
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,280
have been thoroughly crushed!

210
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,560
Lai Luozhi,

211
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
It's time to surrender!

212
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Just moments ago,

213
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,040
your Fire Moth Sect members have

214
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,280
all been eradicated in the entire realm.

215
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,040
The tide has

216
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,200
already turned.

217
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,360
[On the day of the grand assembly,]

218
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,280
[Lai Luozhi will undoubtedly]

219
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
[concentrate his forces in the palace.]

220
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,200
[Jiang Langxing will relay the news]

221
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,520
[to all the delinquents across the land.]

222
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,760
[At that moment,]

223
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,720
[It will be time to dismantle]

224
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,040
[the Fire Moth Sect's strongholds.]

225
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,440
All delinquents, on my command!

226
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,880
Eliminate the Fire Moth Sect,

227
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,840
take down all their strongholds,

228
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,360
and arrest every cultist!

229
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Leave not a single one!

230
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,200
Understood!

231
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,840
[Mr. Liang, If your design]

232
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,840
[for the new crossbow is]

233
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,080
[successfully produced, with multiple]

234
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,320
[arrows launched simultaneously,]

235
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,440
[its power will be unparalleled,]

236
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,680
[our forces will be ten times mightier!]

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
[Then a single elite legion can achieve]

238
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,600
[victory against overwhelming odds.]

239
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,360
Liangs' weaponry are truly remarkable.

240
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,680
In this endeavor to restore order,

241
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
you have made invaluable contributions.

242
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,960
This is all thanks to Lord Shen,

243
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
who's always been there to encourage me.

244
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,160
You pathetic lowlifes!

245
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
Putting on a show of righteousness,

246
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,240
while allowing her to monopolize power.

247
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,440
She is incompetent and tyrannical.

248
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,920
Who is truly responsible for poisoning

249
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
the very foundation of our empire?

250
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
It is her,

251
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,760
Zhou Xu!

252
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
Lai Luozhi,

253
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,200
you established the Fire Moth Sect,

254
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,040
deceiving and manipulating,

255
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,080
harming the loyal and virtuous.

256
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,400
You're responsible for countless deaths.

257
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,000
How dare you speak

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,320
with such arrogance here?

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,840
The Fire Moth Sect can infiltrate

260
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
every corner of the empire

261
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,280
Because I have created

262
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,640
a beautiful dream of resurrection

263
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,840
for the people!

264
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,000
As mere mortals, who can

265
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,520
escape the inevitabilities of death?

266
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,480
Who can avoid the pain of

267
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,920
losing those we hold dear?

268
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,920
From the lowliest to the loftiest,

269
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,520
all must face life's

270
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,400
unavoidable realities!

271
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,280
Even Mo Qianzhi had placed his trust in me,

272
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,240
and acted under my influence!

273
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,760
You shameless scoundrel.

274
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,200
I detest people like you,

275
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,080
who preach righteousness and morality,

276
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,160
while considering themselves exceptional!

277
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,360
You seek to overthrow the monarch;

278
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,680
I cannot condone such treachery!

279
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,040
If my father were still alive,

280
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
He would have done the same!

281
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I'm first and foremost a citizen of

282
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,120
the empire, and only then a son of the Shens!

283
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,000
Your father was a fool too!

284
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,480
[I seek only to uphold a clear conscience,]

285
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,240
[And to be deserving of the people.]

286
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,240
[How could I ever]

287
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,120
[associate myself with the likes of you?]

288
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,320
He believed he was upright, yet he didn't

289
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,880
realize he already made countless enemies.

290
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,080
Many wanted to

291
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
see him dead!

292
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,640
You,

293
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
are just as foolish as your father!

294
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,640
I've only employed a few tricks,

295
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
and I was able to make the Shen Family

296
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,320
fall into the inferno!

297
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,080
Your treachery against

298
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,520
the honorable is unparalleled!

299
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,840
You dream of being in power,

300
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,120
but even God cannot tolerate that!

301
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
God?

302
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,640
Let me ask you,

303
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,560
who determined the Shen Family's crime?

304
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,200
Who is truly responsible

305
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
for the destruction of the Shen Family?

306
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,240
Zhou xu,

307
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,320
you manipulate the throne

308
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,520
through this voiceless emperor,

309
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,520
have you ever been haunted

310
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,560
by your disloyalty to the late emperor,

311
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,920
my father?

312
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,320
I am supposed to be the chosen one,

313
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,920
born of the supreme bloodline!

314
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,080
Today,

315
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,040
I shall reinstate the rightful order

316
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,400
for the Xiao Family and the throne!

317
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,840
[The late emperor?]

318
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,439
[Could it be that he is...]

319
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,439
I am the son of the late emperor

320
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,120
and Consort Shu.

321
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,640
Phoenix leading nine chicks;

322
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,120
peace in the world.

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,640
Purify the source

324
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,880
and reconstruct the realm!

325
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,640
Purify the source

326
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,720
and reconstruct the realm?

327
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,560
So,

328
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,720
the prophecy

329
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,440
indeed has a second half?

330
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
[That statement is falsified.]

331
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,680
Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice, Yan Xing,

332
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,800
greets Your Majesty

333
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,440
and Your Royal Highness.

334
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,800
Please rise, my lady.

335
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
On that day, the Royal Advisor's

336
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,760
prophecy indeed had a second half,

337
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,840
but it was never presented.

338
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
Yet, it's nothing like what he said.

339
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
What proof do you have?

340
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,520
The true prophecy

341
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,680
is hidden within this garment.

342
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,440
The calm sky (Bi) and setting (Luo) sun

343
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,080
hide the coming (Lai) danger?

344
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,040
That's right.

345
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,200
He made a prophecy that day,

346
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,600
and the latter half

347
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,840
refers to the hidden wicked ambitions

348
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
among the officials.

349
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,640
It serves as a warning to Your Highness

350
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,040
to be wary of those around you.

351
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,680
Lai Luozhi has been meticulously running

352
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,800
the Fire Moth Sect for years,

353
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,960
with cultists secretly causing chaos.

354
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,000
The Royal Advisor noticed the signs,

355
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,920
and thus

356
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,000
began to suspect

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,120
Lai Luozhi's identity.

358
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,480
But due to a lack of evidence, he had

359
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,680
no choice but to convey his suspicions

360
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,760
to the world through the prophecy.

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,880
He may have realized that he was being

362
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,760
secretly monitored by Lai Luozhi.

363
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,280
He had to embroider the prophecy

364
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,640
onto the brocade,

365
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,240
concealed within its patterns,

366
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,080
and bide his time until

367
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,160
the moment was right.

368
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,480
But unexpectedly,

369
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,360
he was silenced by the

370
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,160
assassin sent by Lai Luozhi.

371
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,600
But God has a way of ensuring justice,

372
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,840
the brocade with the prophecy was

373
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,320
fortuitously found by the illiterate

374
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,880
Yuan Niang who used it

375
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,120
as the lining of a baby's garment,

376
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,760
and thus it remained.

377
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,880
[If Yuan Niang is just an ordinary woman,]

378
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,360
[how could she afford]

379
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,640
[such fabric?]

380
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,040
[This fabric]

381
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,120
[Is certainly not something]

382
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,400
[an ordinary family could afford.]

383
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,200
The Royal Advisor is stubborn,

384
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,640
and he refuses to see reason.

385
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,240
Are we really going to entrust

386
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,920
the empire to a witless child?

387
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,360
Or to that ineffectual Prince Xian?

388
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,080
Or to the arrogant Princess Ying?

389
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,040
As long as the Empress Dowager

390
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,120
is still in power,

391
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,800
no one's future is secured!

392
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
Once upon a time,

393
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,960
wasn't Princess Runing

394
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,920
also of supreme status?

395
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
But just because someone changed

396
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,800
the embroidery pattern on her clothes,

397
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,960
she was accused of exceeding regulations.

398
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,520
And ended up in her current situation.

399
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,280
So it turns out

400
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,640
Princess Runing

401
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,720
was also framed by you?

402
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,920
If it weren't for your suspicions,

403
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,800
how could I have succeeded so easily?

404
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,880
Just blame yourself!

405
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,000
You, Zhou Xu,

406
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
are the true threat to my Xiao Family!

407
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,360
As a descendant of the Xiao Family,

408
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,880
I must restore order for the empire!

409
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,400
The throne rightfully belongs to me;

410
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,320
it is God's will.

411
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,080
I am the most legitimate prince to ascend!

412
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
But you are not a son of the late emperor;

413
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,720
you were conceived by Consort Shu

414
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,000
in an affair with someone else.

415
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,080
Consort Shu was originally

416
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,880
the carefree Princess Biluo of Nanlang,

417
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,880
who fell in love with General Kongshan,

418
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,000
and they pledged to be together for life.

419
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
It was supposed to be a beautiful story,

420
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,520
But her father, the king,

421
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
forced her to marry into the empire

422
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,960
and wed the late emperor for an alliance.

423
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,400
She swore she'd rather die than comply.

424
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,000
So in a fit of rage,

425
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,160
the king executed General Kongshan, and

426
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,400
threatened her with the lives of his clan.

427
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,080
She could only bribe the palace servants

428
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,720
to escape the inspection,

429
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
and became known as

430
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,360
Consort Shu.

431
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,360
From then on,

432
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,560
she lost her love,

433
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,800
and also her name.

434
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,840
Her reason for continuing to live was

435
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,880
not only to protect the general's clan

436
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
but also for the child she was carrying,

437
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,440
his offspring.

438
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,640
This can't be true!

439
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,600
This can't be...

440
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
My mother would never have lied to me!

441
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,160
I am a descendant of the Xiao Family!

442
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,960
I am the son of the late emperor!

443
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,480
Back then, Nanlang

444
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,800
escorted Princess Biluo

445
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,320
to the empire. During the journey,

446
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,480
someone noticed she was unwell

447
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
and discovered that she was pregnant.

448
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,320
She tried to silence this man,

449
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,600
but fortunately, he managed to escape.

450
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,360
Lai Luozhi,

451
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,600
you are not of the Xiao bloodline.

452
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,360
Lai Luozhi,

453
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,360
from start to finish,

454
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,200
your life has been a lie.

455
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,160
Impossible!

456
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,240
My mother would never have lied to me!

457
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,960
She would never have!

458
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
You are her minions,

459
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,680
every last one of you!

460
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,200
Your lies and treachery

461
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,280
are designed to stop

462
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,000
me from taking the throne

463
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
and restoring

464
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,920
order to the realm!

465
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
Like moths drawn to the flame.

466
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Fleeting...

467
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,040
in life!

468
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,160
After all,

469
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,800
"Like moths drawn to the flame"

470
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,120
this is nothing but a dream...

471
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,240
Open it.

472
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,760
Understood!

473
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,240
Greetings, Lord Jing.

474
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Lai Luozhi's faction has been dealt with.

475
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,840
By order of Lord Commander,

476
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,080
I am here to escort you all home.

477
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,400
We ask for your understanding

478
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,640
if the Imperial Guard

479
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,760
has not been attentive.

480
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
That's wonderful!

481
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,440
Lord Jing,

482
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,320
Lord Commander confined us

483
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,400
in Imperial Guard's

484
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,680
dungeon to genuinely

485
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,800
protect us from the

486
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,480
threats of Lai Luozhi's faction.

487
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,160
We are

488
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,440
fully aware of that!

489
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,440
Right, right!

490
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,160
Shen Du,

491
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
you need to understand,

492
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,360
once the die is cast,

493
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,320
there's no turning back.

494
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I have made up my mind.

495
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,800
Lady Xu,

496
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
please inform Her Royal Highness.

497
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,320
Lady Yan, please come another day.

498
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,280
Her Royal Highness

499
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,360
will summon me shortly.

500
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,320
She won't be available for you.

501
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,920
The officials from Lai Luozhi's faction

502
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,760
have been ordered to face scrutiny.

503
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
What is your purpose in

504
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,200
visiting Her Royal Highness today?

505
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,360
I have quelled the rebels and rendered

506
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,120
meritorious service to the empire.

507
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,960
I have come to request a reward.

508
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,800
Do I need to discuss this with someone

509
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,160
of your status, a lowly rank-six official?

510
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,160
I shall join Lord Shen in the meeting

511
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,480
with Her Royal Highness.

512
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,320
The effort was not solely yours.

513
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,440
I have contributed as well.

514
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,640
You cannot claim

515
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,040
all the credit.

516
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
If you want to seek rewards,

517
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,000
you should ask your direct superior

518
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
to submit an request for it.

519
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,280
Lady Yan,

520
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,400
you should return.

521
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,840
It's unheard of to ask for a reward

522
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,520
and present a gift at the same time.

523
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,040
I believe this box contains the booklet

524
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,360
that has caused a stir

525
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,240
among all the officials.

526
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,400
You came today

527
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,240
for Shen Family...

528
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,000
Lady Yan,

529
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,480
choose your words carefully.

530
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,800
Now that we are divorced,

531
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,720
you're no longer my wife.

532
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,880
The affairs of my family

533
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,040
are not for you to interfere with!

534
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,560
Fine.

535
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,680
Even if I am no longer your wife,

536
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
I will still pursue this to the end.

537
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,720
I came here

538
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,000
not as

539
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
your wife,

540
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,960
But as a chief clerk

541
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,800
of the Ministry of Justice.

542
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm here to overturn the wrongful

543
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,760
conviction and restore the innocents' names.

544
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,520
And that is my aspiration.

545
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,160
Lord Shen,

546
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,320
Her Royal Highness summons you.

547
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
As an official of the Ministry of Justice,

548
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,760
you should know better

549
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,120
that Her Royal Highness is summoning

550
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,040
the commander of Imperial Guard.

551
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,160
You have no right to come uninvited.

552
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,440
Are you planning to barge in her chamber?

553
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,640
If you go in alone,

554
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,040
then we shall not see each other again.

555
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,720
His Majesty has caught a slight cold

556
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,160
and will take a day to recuperate.

557
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,240
He will hold the assembly tomorrow.

558
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,920
My lords,

559
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,160
Do you have any reports to present?

560
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Qiao Wenzhi,

561
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,000
you are in charge of Gannan.

562
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,200
Do you

563
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,200
have anything to report today?

564
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,760
Your Royal Highness,

565
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,320
with the Lai faction eradicated,

566
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,080
the realm enjoys peace and prosperity.

567
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,840
Gannan is also thriving.

568
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,560
We are truly in an era of peace.

569
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,560
There is nothing to report.

570
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,640
A fine time of peace indeed!

571
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,040
The Lai faction has been vanquished,

572
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
but this booklet they left behind

573
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,200
is quite informative.

574
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Qiao Wenzhi, you secretly imported

575
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,480
goods from Xichen, entering the empire

576
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,160
through the Gannan to profit.

577
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,520
Your Royal Highness,

578
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,480
this is a false accusation!

579
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
The so-called evidence

580
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,320
left by the rebels in Gannan

581
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,440
cannot be trusted!

582
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
It's not reliable!

583
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,680
Unreliable?

584
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,600
Then

585
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,960
how would you explain

586
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,360
those two sets of accounts?

587
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Those were not from the Lai faction!

588
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,360
The accounts for the Ming Hall reconstruction

589
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,160
reveals a discrepancy between

590
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,640
the ledgers, nearly doubling the cost!

591
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
However, the corruption in the Ming Hall

592
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,480
involves officials from all ministries,

593
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,440
not just...

594
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,160
Qiao Wenzhi,

595
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,800
stop your nonsense!

596
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,560
Your Royal Highness,

597
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,080
Qiao Wenzhi

598
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,520
has been my subordinate for years.

599
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,200
He has been blinded by greed,

600
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,760
embezzling funds,

601
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,320
committing a grave crime.

602
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,640
This was the result of my oversight.

603
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,600
I seek Your Highness' penalties.

604
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,800
Result of your oversight?

605
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,360
Lord Zhang, your erudition is immense,

606
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,320
and your choice of words is impeccable.

607
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,800
Qiao Wenzhi

608
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,800
has been utterly loyal to you.

609
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Most of the

610
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,440
embezzled funds

611
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,240
ended up in your pocket.

612
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,680
Zhang Xingwei,

613
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,880
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

614
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,720
I...

615
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,480
have nothing to say.

616
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,680
Prince Xian.

617
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,840
Mother.

618
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,760
Let me ask you,

619
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,440
how should we deal with him?

620
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,000
Your Highness' wisdom is unmatched,

621
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
and will surely make a decisive judgment.

622
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,240
I'll make a decisive judgment?

623
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,960
I am asking you now,

624
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,480
what is your judgment?

625
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
Since childhood, I have studied under him,

626
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,080
He has consistently set a high standard,

627
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,000
instructing me to place the

628
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,640
interests of the empire first.

629
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,200
I do not believe Lord Zhang

630
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,360
would have committed such a crime

631
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
for a mere handful of silver.

632
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,160
There must be more to this

633
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,320
than meets the eye.

634
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,400
Oh, Prince Xian,

635
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,320
you are so misguided.

636
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,560
That's merely a facade I have maintained,

637
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,160
deceiving you for all these years,

638
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,800
and yet, you still plead for my defense.

639
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,800
Well,

640
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,800
What a touching bond of mentor and pupil!

641
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,720
Lord Zhang,

642
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,200
let me explain on your behalf.

643
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,440
You received the money,

644
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
yet you did not spend it on yourself.

645
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,880
You used it

646
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,680
to buy off other officials,

647
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,640
in order to have them

648
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,720
support Prince Xian alongside you!

649
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,040
Your Royal Highness,

650
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,360
now that it has come to this,

651
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,680
I

652
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,400
will no longer conceal the truth.

653
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,600
His Highness,

654
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,400
Prince Xian,

655
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,840
truly knows nothing about it.

656
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,320
It was all my doing.

657
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,280
Please grant me the death penalty

658
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,480
to serve as a warning to others!

659
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,280
Do you think

660
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,120
that your death

661
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,680
will erase your crimes?

662
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,280
The innocent officials who

663
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
died unjustly due to your actions

664
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,720
can never be brought back!

665
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,400
Lord Shen,

666
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,960
present it!

667
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,520
[By the will of God,]

668
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,160
[we hereby declare: ]

669
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,160
[traitor Shen Bingzhu,]

670
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,839
[guilty of colluding with the enemy,]

671
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,160
[burning our military granaries,]

672
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,920
[revealing weapon blueprints,]

673
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,920
[conspiring with foreign powers,]

674
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,880
[and committing treason!]

675
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:51,240
[His crimes are punishable by death.]

676
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,560
[The Shens are sentenced to confinement and banishment.]

677
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,759
[Let this be known to all!]

678
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,080
[My desire is not for eternal glory,]

679
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,359
[but to live with a clear conscience,]

680
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:07,120
[faithful to the populace.]

681
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,400
[Master was inherently modest,]

682
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,400
[always seeking to avoid court intrigues.]

683
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,160
[His only concern was for the people.]

684
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,120
[Regardless of who it was in power,]

685
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,960
[he simply did what he believed was right.]

686
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,600
[Peace for the people was his only wish.]

687
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,600
[I, nourished by monarch's bounty,]

688
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:22,480
[stands ready to shoulder His Majesty's burdens,]

689
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,560
[with no fear of death.]

690
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,840
I, Shen Du,

691
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,600
am here to seek justice for my father,

692
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,640
Shen Bingzhu.

693
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,480
[The traitor Shen Bingzhu's son, Shen Du]

694
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,960
[accuses my father]

695
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,440
[of colluding with foreign powers]

696
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,640
[and committing treason!]

697
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,720
[I hereby report!]

698
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,520
[The traitor Shen Bingzhu's son, Shen Du]

699
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,920
[accuses my father]

700
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,640
[of colluding with foreign powers]

701
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,480
Am here to seek justice for my father,

702
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,200
Shen Bingzhu.

703
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,640
Sixteen years ago,

704
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,200
Our empire was at war with Xichen.

705
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,560
When we urgently needed provisions,

706
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
the main granary storing food supplies

707
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,120
suddenly

708
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,840
caught fire for unknown reasons,

709
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,720
burning all

710
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
our provisions.

711
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,600
Shen Bingzhu, who was entrusted with

712
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,040
our provisions, had been discovered

713
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
to be a traitor and sentenced to death.

714
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,280
This

715
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,960
piece of sack bearing the granary seal

716
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,080
from that year

717
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,920
should have been completely burned.

718
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,840
Yet it appeared

719
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,160
in Gannan from thousands of miles away.

720
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,760
The letter of collusion,

721
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,560
which you submitted to the late emperor,

722
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,800
was discovered to be

723
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,400
not of Shen Bingzhu's own hand.

724
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,080
Lord Zhang,

725
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,000
what do you have to say for yourself?

726
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,400
When the war broke out,

727
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,560
my disciple came to me,

728
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,960
and I learned

729
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,640
that he colluded with local officials

730
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,440
to sell off grains from imperial granary.

731
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,560
They bought it at low prices

732
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,680
and sold it at high prices the following

733
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,320
year, profiting from the difference.

734
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,480
Unexpectedly,

735
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,640
the war with Xichen suddenly broke out,

736
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
and the provisions in the granary

737
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,400
had been sold out.

738
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,040
Only a pile of straw remained...

739
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,360
Oh, Lord Zhang,

740
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,080
I never imagined until now that this,

741
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,880
which could shake the foundation of the

742
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,040
state, would actually be related to you.

743
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,840
Your Royal Highness,

744
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,680
I never expected either,

745
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,600
that one day

746
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,240
I would cover up

747
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,840
my student's crimes

748
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,960
by committing such a heinous act.

749
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,360
It was I who ordered someone

750
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,920
to imitate Lord Shen's handwriting

751
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,080
to come up with that treasonous letter.

752
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,480
You forged the treasonous letter.

753
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,320
Then what

754
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,120
caused the fire?

755
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,440
Lord Zhang,

756
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,200
do you want me to investigate further?

757
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,040
Your Royal Highness,

758
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,760
this was all my doing.

759
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,680
May this investigation end with me.

760
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,240
To delve deeper could

761
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,720
destabilize the core of our empire.

762
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,000
It could potentially

763
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
expose influential figures

764
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,560
within our empire,

765
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,120
achieving nothing but losing much!

766
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,960
Influential figures?

767
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Who are

768
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,760
these individuals?

769
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,880
There are certain things

770
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,200
that I

771
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,080
must leave unspoken...

772
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,480
[Lord Shen, please.]

773
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,720
[Do you really have so much faith in me?]

774
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,120
[Aren't you afraid that you]

775
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,800
[and this box might disappear together?]

776
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
[Over the years,]

777
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,640
[I have witnessed Your Highness devote]

778
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,760
[yourself to the welfare of the people.]

779
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,560
[I believe you will make]

780
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,680
[a fair and just decision.]

781
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,680
[I am willing to]

782
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,400
[bet my life on it.]

783
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,720
Let me

784
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,080
clarify for you.

785
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,280
Before Lord Shen took over the granary,

786
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,240
the local official stationed there

787
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,840
was my nephew,

788
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,880
Zhou Miao!

789
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,560
Fearing that the matter would be exposed,

790
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
he colluded with the Lai faction

791
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,480
using the Ignition Craft from Jinwu

792
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,280
to set our granary ablaze,

793
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,880
burning it to ashes!

794
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,640
Your Royal Highness,

795
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,400
you...

796
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,800
Someone!

797
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,840
Detain him for a thorough investigation!

798
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,600
Any member of the Zhou Family implicated

799
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,360
will face harsher punishment!

800
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,320
Your Royal Highness, mercy!

801
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,120
Spare me!

802
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,720
Prince Xian,

803
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,840
I ask you again,

804
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,240
how should we

805
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,560
deal with Lord Zhang?

806
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,720
I humbly request that Your Highness

807
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,400
mete out justice to Zhang Xingwei

808
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,280
but I also

809
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,560
implore you to consider his past merits

810
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,240
and show leniency to

811
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,960
the members of the Zhang Family.
