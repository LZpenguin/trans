3
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,880
Lord Geng,

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,080
that villain is getting bolder

5
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,360
by the day.

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,480
We need to think of a countermeasure!

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
Lord Geng?

8
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
The petty thief is hanged,

9
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,759
the great thief wears a crown.

10
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,960
My beloved,

11
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,880
you must resent me, so you torment me

12
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,800
with nightmares every night, right?

13
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
Are you under the impression,

14
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,160
like those seasoned officials,

15
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
that I'm not cut out

16
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,600
to be the sovereign?

17
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
My beloved,

18
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,000
Qi

19
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,360
is still unable to speak;

20
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,200
Xichen and Nan Lang are predatory,

21
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,320
and I alone

22
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,360
bear the weight of the entire empire.

23
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
What have I done to earn such suffering?

24
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
You Royal Highness.

25
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,000
Facing the current political turmoil,

26
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,200
you should prioritize your well-being.

27
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,880
It's nothing.

28
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,400
With the Royal Advisor gone,

29
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,040
and the internal and external threats,

30
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
I can't help but feel anxious.

31
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
Have the matters of the court

32
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,440
been arranged properly?

33
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,920
As per your decree,

34
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Chancellor Lai is in charge

35
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,880
of court affairs.

36
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,200
He implores you

37
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,720
to set aside your concerns for the empire

38
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,920
and focus on your recovery.

39
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Good.

40
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,800
I still remember how the Royal Advisor

41
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,560
dedicated himself completely.

42
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,320
In his final moments, he's still making

43
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,760
efforts to foresee the future.

44
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
I sincerely hope

45
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,000
that the empire's fortune

46
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,160
can align with his prophecies,

47
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,240
leading to peace and prosperity.

48
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,520
Go! Faster!

49
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,600
Qi Yeyun, Qi Yeyun!

50
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,880
- Come out now!
- Coming!

51
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,480
- What's going on?
- We need to close right away!

52
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
Why do we close during the day?

53
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,440
You've been cooped up indoors,

54
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
do you know nothing of what's happening?

55
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,120
Disaster is upon us!

56
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,240
Her Royal Highness is gravely ill,

57
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,720
and the Dark Demon is taking over.

58
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,360
I heard that

59
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,240
a few loyal officials

60
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,440
who opposed it

61
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,760
have all been assassinated!

62
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,920
In such chaotic times,

63
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
what do we need business for?

64
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,760
With the political situation in turmoil,

65
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,240
isn't this the perfect opportunity

66
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
for our pawn shop?

67
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
You're being foolish!

68
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,040
Let me ask you,

69
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,080
is money more important than life?

70
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,120
Hurry,

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
close the shop!

72
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
What brings Chancellor Lai to the Imperial Guard

73
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,720
with such a

74
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,560
grand military escort?

75
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,560
As it stands, the Jin Family

76
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,960
is being detained here,

77
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,840
yet their case remains unresolved.

78
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,920
Does Lord Shen believe

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,520
that Her Royal Highness'

80
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
illness

81
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
justifies your inaction?

82
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
The Imperial Guard still requires

83
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,440
additional evidence.

84
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,280
Evidence?

85
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,640
What I have brought serves as evidence.

86
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
I urge Lord Shen to

87
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
review and render a judgment on it.

88
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,960
How can I make a ruling

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,880
based solely on side's testimony?

90
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,320
You refuse?

91
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Very well,

92
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
I'll take it upon myself then.

93
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,760
Lai Luozhi,

94
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
are you openly challenging

95
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,840
the authority of the royal court?

96
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,680
The affairs of the Imperial Guard

97
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,440
are not for the Imperial Inspectorate,

98
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
of equal rank, to interfere with.

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
If the II is not qualified,

100
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,080
then I, Lai Luozhi, is.

101
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,200
Let it not be forgotten

102
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
that Her Royal Highness has granted me

103
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,840
the authority to order the officials at my discretion!

104
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Imperial Garrison, on my command!

105
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,120
Shen Du, of the Imperial Guard,

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,360
is hereby arrested for dereliction of duty

107
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,920
which occurred during

108
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,280
Her Royal Highness'

109
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,160
period of indisposition.

110
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
What?

111
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,840
Going up against the Imperial Garrison?

112
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
Lord Shen, are you plotting a coup?

113
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,880
If you kill the commander of the Imperial Garrison,

114
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
you will be charged with treason today,

115
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
and the entire Imperial Guard

116
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
will pay the price!

117
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,520
Don't you dare!

118
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,640
Lai Luozhi,

119
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
you actually mobilized the

120
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,280
crossbow unit of the Imperial Garrison?

121
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,720
The Imperial Garrison's proven to be more

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,880
in tune with the times than the Imperial Guard.

123
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,520
Those in the Imperial Guard who refuse

124
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,680
to comply will be executed on the spot!

125
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
Lower your weapons!

126
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
Please,

127
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,000
Lord Shen.

128
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,800
My lord! My lord!

129
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,680
Bad news! Something major has happened!

130
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Lord Lai has surrounded the Imperial Guard

131
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
with the Imperial Garrison!

132
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
Lord Commander and

133
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,160
everyone in the Imperial Guard

134
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,920
have been detained in

135
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,160
the prison of the Imperial Inspectorate.

136
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,480
Has Lai Luozhi really

137
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,680
made a move against Lord Shen?

138
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,440
Yes, really.

139
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,480
The IG and the II

140
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,560
have always been fierce rivals.

141
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,240
Given Chancellor Lai's usual temperament,

142
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,480
he must be eager

143
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,720
to eradicate everyone

144
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,680
in the Imperial Guard

145
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,760
and wipe out their entire families!

146
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,960
Everyone!

147
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,760
Wu Taiming!

148
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
What are you up to?

149
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,480
Are you going to hand over Xing?

150
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,320
Arm yourselves!

151
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,560
Yes, my lord!

152
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
Feng Gui!

153
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,760
Bring over my and Lady Yan's

154
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,040
appointment documents

155
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
from Her Royal Highness!

156
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
If he dares to come after her,

157
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,120
I will make it clear to him:

158
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,840
Yan Xing is not just

159
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,040
the wife of the commander of

160
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,960
the Imperial Guard,

161
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,320
but also Her Royal Highness' appointed

162
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,200
rank six chief clerk

163
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,560
in the Ministry of Justice!

164
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,560
Follow me!

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,160
Barricade the main entrance!

166
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,200
My lord! My lord!

167
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,680
How long has it been?

168
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,520
The men from the Imperial Inspectorate

169
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
still haven't shown up!

170
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
How many times must I remind you

171
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,760
not to let your guard down?

172
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080
Stay vigilant!

173
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,400
Keep watch!

174
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,800
But they haven't shown up...

175
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,760
Alright, alright...

176
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,120
Who is it?

177
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,760
My lady.

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
Xing!

179
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
It's your brother!

180
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
-Xing!
-Mojie?

181
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,040
My lady!

182
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,480
-Xing!
-Uncle Zhong?

183
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
Open the gate!

184
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,080
Mojie!

185
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,840
My lady!

186
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,880
Uncle Zhong!

187
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,520
Father sent me to bring you home.

188
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,400
We will protect you as a family.

189
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,560
Mojie,

190
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560
thank you.

191
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,240
Uncle Zhong,

192
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,560
today,

193
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,920
I will return to the Shen residence!

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,880
My lady...

195
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,080
Please!

196
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,600
I, Yan Xing,

197
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,760
extend my gratitude to all colleagues!

198
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,880
My lady, please.

199
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,160
Is this really our once-mighty

200
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,920
Lord Commander, Lord Shen?

201
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
I can hardly recognize you now.

202
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,080
Shen Du!

203
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,240
You truly lack wit.

204
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,560
Your stubbornness is impressive!

205
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,120
In the Imperial Inspectorate,

206
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
I've encountered all sorts of

207
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,640
tough men.

208
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
After a few rounds of torture,

209
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,080
if they refuse to comply,

210
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,800
then they would rather seek death.

211
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,880
Yet here you are, glaring at me

212
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,760
with such defiance.

213
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,520
I must admit, you have been

214
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,680
a truly worthy opponent

215
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
all these years.

216
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
The torture devices of the II

217
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,800
are indeed as fearsome as they say.

218
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,800
I, Shen Du, have finally

219
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
experienced them in my lifetime.

220
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,960
You are quite capable;

221
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,680
if you were to die,

222
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
wouldn't that be a great loss?

223
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,920
People call you The White Death,

224
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,680
and me the Dark Demon.

225
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,560
If we were to join forces,

226
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,200
The White Death and the Dark Demon,

227
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,400
who in this world

228
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,040
could stand against us?

229
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,200
I, Shen Du, a decent man,

230
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
would be ashamed to be

231
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,000
compared to someone like you!

232
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,680
You refuse to see...

233
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,760
It is widely known that

234
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,400
the two of us are

235
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,080
the Empress Dowager's right-hand men.

236
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,040
But do you realize

237
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,680
that she has long harbored suspicions

238
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,840
about our true intentions?

239
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:34,120
She has set us to spy on each other,

240
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,520
to fight among ourselves.

241
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,479
And she,

242
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
sits back to reap the rewards.

243
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,280
After all, she is the

244
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,040
most formidable woman in the world!

245
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,360
Everyone is under her thumb.

246
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,520
You are,

247
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,520
and I am as well.

248
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,000
Even the Shen Family

249
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,560
back then...

250
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,160
Has no one ever told you that

251
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
the downfall of the Shen Family was

252
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,960
orchestrated by the Empress Dowager herself?

253
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
And you,

254
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,800
you fool,

255
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,040
have knelt on the blood

256
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,640
of dozens from the Shen Family

257
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,600
for all these years,

258
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,320
acting as a lackey for your true enemy!

259
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
Any proof?

260
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,680
Proof?

261
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,320
Stop deceiving yourself.

262
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
You must have

263
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,400
come to understand that

264
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,040
during Shen Bingzhu's treason case,

265
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,640
there were several individuals

266
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
who took the opportunity

267
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,160
to exploit his downfall.

268
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,080
Why?

269
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,280
Because everyone knew that it was the

270
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,640
Empress Dowager who ordered his death!

271
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,000
Dozens of lives,

272
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,680
not a single one spared...

273
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,280
only you, a lackey, remains!

274
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,600
You're talking nonsense!

275
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
It's a lie!

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
A lie!

277
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,560
Yes,

278
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,840
you saw it.

279
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,520
The fire moth is me!

280
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
I am the true master

281
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,000
of the Fire Moth Sect!

282
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,120
Shen Du, you have witnessed

283
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,680
the might of the Fire Moth Sect.

284
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,720
Why not join me

285
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,000
in achieving something great?

286
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,200
My lady.

287
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,960
My lady,

288
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
Xiang'an City is now

289
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,000
under the control of Lai Luozhi.

290
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,040
Many officials who opposed him

291
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,000
have been assassinated.

292
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,040
You must exercise extreme caution

293
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,840
on your journey there!

294
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
Uncle Zhong,

295
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,360
no matter the challenges I face

296
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
on this journey,

297
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,800
I will not back down.

298
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,720
What happened back then

299
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,080
will not repeat itself.

300
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,400
I, Yan Xing,

301
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,160
must enter the palace

302
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,960
to seek justice from Her Royal Highness.

303
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,720
Remember to leave the door open for me.

304
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,680
Yes!

305
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
We bid you farewell, my lady!

306
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,800
Yan Xing, be wise,

307
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,040
don't go any further!

308
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,280
What if I refuse?

309
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,840
Do you intend to

310
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,760
continue assassinating

311
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
officials in broad daylight?

312
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,600
Has justice completely disappeared?

313
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,160
Are you alright?

314
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,720
Xing,

315
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
proceed with what you need to do.

316
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,840
Silly Yan Xing,

317
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,320
if you're trying to rescue your man, hurry!

318
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
Thank you!

319
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,360
Let's go!

320
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,600
I, a rank six official of the Ministry of Justice,

321
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
chief clerk, Yan Xing,

322
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,440
accuse the treacherous official Lai Luozhi

323
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,600
of abusing his power,

324
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,240
distorting the truth, and wrongfully

325
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,120
accusing Shen Du of the Imperial Guard!

326
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,120
Lord Shen Du, his loyalty

327
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,480
is unwavering, as clear as day.

328
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,560
I implore Your Highness to restore his honor!

329
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,360
I, a rank six official of the Ministry of Justice,

330
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,200
chief clerk, Yan Xing,

331
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,080
accuse the treacherous official Lai Luozhi

332
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,920
of abusing his power,

333
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
distorting the truth.

334
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,600
Lord Shen Du, his loyalty

335
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,960
is unwavering, as clear as day.

336
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
I implore Your Highness to restore his honor!

337
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,880
Her Highness is not seeing anyone now.

338
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,880
You should go back.

339
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,520
All is fated;

340
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,280
what you're doing is futile.

341
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,320
I, a rank six official of the Ministry of Justice,

342
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,040
chief clerk, Yan Xing,

343
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,680
accuse the treacherous official Lai Luozhi

344
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
of abusing his power,

345
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,120
distorting the truth.

346
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,960
I implore Your Highness

347
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,360
to restore Shen Du's honor!

348
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,720
Chief,

349
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
do you think I can be

350
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,280
considered a heroine today?

351
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,720
Absolutely!

352
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,840
Without a doubt!

353
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,240
Why are you smiling?

354
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,560
I was just thinking, how could

355
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,280
a girl like you wish to be a heroine?

356
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
Because only a true heroine

357
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,640
is worthy to be with a hero!

358
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,720
By the way,

359
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,280
how's your dowry coming along?

360
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
You've been the Chief Inspector for years;

361
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,680
you must have saved up

362
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
a fortune, right?

363
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,840
Once this is all over,

364
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,560
I will definitely throw you

365
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,600
a grand wedding

366
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,200
and invite all the delinquents

367
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
to attend it.

368
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,920
so you can marry me in style!

369
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,720
Really?

370
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
Of course!

371
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,960
A distress signal

372
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
from the brothers of the delinquents!

373
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,680
It's outside the city!

374
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,280
Chief...

375
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,640
Fear not!

376
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,800
Your attempts are futile,

377
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
- you petty villains!
- Yun Que!

378
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,160
On my command,

379
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,160
bail!

380
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,040
Bail?

381
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,840
Yes.

382
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Return to the city and get Jiang Langxing;

383
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,000
bring reinforcements back.

384
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,920
This is an order from the Chief Inspector,

385
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,240
and you have to carry it out!

386
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,160
Yes, sir!

387
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,280
[This isn't right.]

388
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,440
[Xiangren wasn't asking me]

389
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,400
[to find reinforcements.]

390
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,120
[He knows there's no time for that.]

391
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,680
[He was trying to cover my escape!]

392
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Xiangren!

393
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,640
Yun Que...

394
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,560
the grand wedding...

395
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,280
that I've promised

396
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,320
may not come to pass...

397
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,520
How should you address me?

398
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,640
My...

399
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,280
dear wife...

400
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:17,440
Let's face our fate together as family.

401
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,600
Good!

402
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,880
Now the power in the court

403
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,840
is firmly in my grasp.

404
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,760
Only that group of

405
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,480
obstinate delinquents

406
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,680
remain so uncontrollable.

407
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,160
The remaining pedantic scholars

408
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,040
are much easier to coerce

409
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,800
than those rascals.

410
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,720
Now that the delinquents are leaderless,

411
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,640
they won't make any real impact.

412
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,680
Now that the Chief Inspector is gone,

413
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,840
the commander of the Imperial Guard

414
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,000
should also see the reality.

415
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,040
Why did you bring me here?

416
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,440
On such a winter night,

417
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,560
you're invited here

418
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,040
to enjoy a different view.

419
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,160
If I hadn't been aware

420
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,720
that Yan Xing was a spy

421
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,440
sent by Lord Zhang to keep an eye on you,

422
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,360
I might have felt a pang of

423
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,800
sympathy for your deep affection.

424
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,120
I could almost shed a tear for you.

425
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,400
Your wife,

426
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,200
today, for your sake,

427
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
bravely stormed the palace gates

428
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,720
and knelt in the snow

429
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,360
for an entire day.

430
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,680
You didn't bring me here so late

431
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,880
just to see my wife, did you?

432
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,320
I find myself envious of you!

433
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,560
Why are there always so many people

434
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,360
willing to follow you into danger?

435
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,960
You might not realize yet, but to

436
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,600
ensure your wife's entry into the palace,

437
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,000
the Chief Inspector and his woman

438
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,120
have even sacrificed their lives.

439
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,200
What a tragedy!

440
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,120
How lamentable!

441
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Lord Shen,

442
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,720
I believe after all these days,

443
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,800
you should have a sense of how

444
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,120
the situation will unfold, right?

445
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,480
You must have the answer already.

446
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,600
Do you still remember,

447
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,040
when I gave you

448
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,680
that vial of blood,

449
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,120
you promised me something back then.

450
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,440
Whether you're genuine or feigned,

451
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,520
I need you to be on my side.

452
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,920
Of course.

453
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,960
That's reassuring.

454
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
I believe that Shen Du

455
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,800
is certainly not

456
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,560
someone who would go back on his word!

457
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,520
My Lady!

458
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm perfectly fine. Just some snow.

459
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,960
It's a pity, though, that

460
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,000
I couldn't meet Her Highness today.

461
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,880
I will try again tomorrow

462
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,880
to seek an audience.

463
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,480
Shen Du...

464
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
You've been released?

465
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,880
Did Her Royal Highness

466
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,040
allow you to return?

467
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,480
It was Chancellor Lai.

468
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,200
Chancellor Lai?

469
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,720
Lai Luozhi agreed to let you go?

470
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,080
He actually showed some kindness?

471
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,480
What happened to your face?

472
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,240
Let me take a look...

473
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
My love,

474
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,360
what's going on?

475
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,840
Yan Xing,

476
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,320
let's get a divorce.

477
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,480
What did you...

478
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,480
You and I

479
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,640
should get a divorce.

480
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,440
Divorce?

481
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,600
Why?

482
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,720
Did you encounter

483
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,040
some kind of danger?

484
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,200
Did Lai Luozhi

485
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
force you in some way?

486
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,440
What on earth happened?

487
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,320
Shen Du, you know me.

488
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,320
I am Yan Xing.

489
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,600
I'm a chief clerk of the Ministry of Justice.

490
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,200
Though my rank is modest,

491
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,840
I've handled

492
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,520
numerous significant cases

493
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,600
as a female official.

494
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,960
I'm not the kind of girl

495
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,240
who relies on her husband

496
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,680
for protection and support,

497
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,760
but someone who can stand by your side

498
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,640
and weather the storms with you,

499
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,760
like a steadfast mountain.

500
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,680
I'm not afraid of challenges

501
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,840
or hardships.

502
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,600
No matter what happens,

503
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,320
I can face it

504
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,640
alongside you.

505
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,320
Are you worried about implicating the Yans?

506
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,920
Shen Du,

507
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,640
if Lai Luozhi

508
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,440
was determined to target us,

509
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,720
even if we were to divorce,

510
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,960
he wouldn't spare my family.

511
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,200
We should work together

512
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,360
to find ways to protect them.

513
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,360
For instance,

514
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,920
we could send the Yans

515
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,160
out of town to avoid what's coming.

516
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,880
And also...

517
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,080
Yan Xing!

518
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,240
This isn't about your family,

519
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,720
and no one coerced me.

520
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,720
The reason is quite simple.

521
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,360
After everything I've been through,

522
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,520
I've come to realize

523
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,880
that weathering many storms,

524
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,840
what my family truly needs

525
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,120
is a graceful woman who can support me.

526
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,680
You cannot provide me

527
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,400
with a peaceful household, nor do you hold

528
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,120
your husband in the highest regard.

529
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,480
You are always competitive,

530
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,320
wanting to stand out.

531
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,720
You are not someone I can

532
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,240
envision spending my life with.
