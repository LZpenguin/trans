3
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,560
Just sit back and listen quietly.

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,840
Don't create any disturbances.

5
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,520
Or, you'll face charges of

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
disrupting the proceedings.

7
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,880
That's quite a chilling warning.

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,920
But let's be honest here,

9
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,720
[although Ji Fangming]

10

he's still an appointed official by

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,520
the emperor's decree.

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,000
If you intend to coerce a confession,

14
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,000
I certainly won't turn a blind eye.

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
Ji Fangming!

16
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,840
No matter how many

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920

20

You've been scheming for years,

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,880
isn't it all just to uncover

22
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,360
the truth behind the

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
Jinxiu Shop incident?

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,440
[Regrettably,]

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,600

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,800
and seeking revenge on the wrong target.

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,360
You're manipulated without knowing it.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Ma'am, spare me your theatrics.

Trying to trick a suspect into confessing,

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,400
[that tactic is]

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
[hardly groundbreaking.]

32

Since you're all eager,

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
I'll lay out the truth for you.

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
Chen Shoujie and his wife

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,880
[were the true instigators behind it all.]

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Everything that has unfolded recently

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,200
is entirely my doing.

38
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
To seek vengeance for the lives

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
unjustly lost in the

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,280
Jinxiu Shop incident.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,640
What makes you so sure

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,360
that your knowledge

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
encompasses the entire truth?

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,640
Lady Chen was originally

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,880
an embroiderer at the Shop.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
To shield her, Chen Shoujie

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,400
manipulated the investigation

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,640
to erase her origins.

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,200
[He altered the testimonies of others.]

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
[Kong Xianrong]

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,040
[personally inspected the summer garments]

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,720
before they were delivered to

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,000
the princess' residence.

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
[He verified them against the work]

55
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,880
[before sealing them away.]

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Thus,

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
the swap could only have happened

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,320
during the interaction

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
with the embroiderers.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,720
[Following the incident,]

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,720
everyone at the Shop

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,040
was detained and interrogated,

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,440
yet only his wife

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,520
[managed to evade capture.]

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,880
Once I uncovered the truth,

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,400
I approached him to test his reactions.

67
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,320
Shoujie,

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
do you recall this item?

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,360
No...

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
You must not...

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,080
To live...

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,840
I was wrong.

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
We were wrong...

75
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,120
We're completely unaware.

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,480
Revenge has its source...

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,280
Please, don't

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,599
come after us!

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,760
My love,

80
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,919
we can't say a word.

81
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,359
[So,]

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
you're absolutely convinced

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,120
that Chen Shoujie is the murderer.

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
Do you understand why

85
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
he's so fearful of these illusions?

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,520
[Because he knew]

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
[that many lives were unjustly taken.]

88
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,520
He feared vengeful spirits!

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,760
He carried

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,880
guilt!

91
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,360
In this world, there are no ghosts.

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,320
If there are indeed ghosts,

93
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,360
they exist solely within the hearts.

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,080
If your conscience is clear,

95
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,200
why should you fear

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
the arrival of these spirits?

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
[Lord Shen is indeed honorable.]

98
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,240
But not everyone is the same

99
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,360
as you describe.

100
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,480
Someone,

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,440
even after committing heinous acts,

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,400
will still don a facade

103
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,360
of righteousness,

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,840
[blending in with the masses.]

105
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,240
[Then,]

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,280
we can't discern evil from good.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
So,

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,720
you took the step to kill Lady Chen.

109
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,480
That's true.

110
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,760
She deserved her fate!

111
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,640
[She was the true mastermind.]

112
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,720
[She's the one]

113
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,640
who tampered with the summer

114
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,520
designs.

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
This is for Jinxiu Shop!

116
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,520
I knew this day would come.

117
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Any last words?

118
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,840
Time to repay my debt.

119
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,320
I killed her.

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,120
It was merely to bring solace

121
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
to my friend's spirit in the afterlife.

122
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,560
What's wrong with that?

123
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Even the most unforgivable individuals

124
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,720
should face the law's judgment.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
If necessary, you can call

126
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,400
for seeking justice.

127
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,840
But unauthorized killing

128
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
is fundamentally wrong!

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,440
That's easy for you to say.

130
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
[What?]

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
[Seeking justice?]

132
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,280
Who doesn't know

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
that this is a wrong trial?

134
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,400
But who is willing

135
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
to speak the truth in so many years?

136
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,960
Let's focus on...

137
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,680

Yes.

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,280
he has lost his sanity,

178
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,520
and you still

179
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
choose to believe

180
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,720
that he is innocent.

181
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,520
You simply refuse to accept the truth

182
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,480
that it was a wrongful conviction.

183
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,200
Thus,

184
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,480
you are also guilty!

185
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,280
You all

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,080
should pay for your sins!

187
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
[What fire moth?]

188
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,240
[Fire moth, fire moth!]

189
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,640
This was discovered at

190
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,400
Chen Shoujie's residence,

191
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,480
belonging to Jinxiu Shop.

192
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
If they truly are

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,040
the instigators you speak of,

194
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,280
then why

195
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,120
have the kept the very item that

196
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,000
reminds them

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
of their crimes?

198
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,440
This isn't right.

199
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,680
Perhaps those who feel

200
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,200
helpless and tormented by the events

201
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,280
of that year are not limited to you.

202
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,920
This isn't right.

203
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,080
I am absolutely certain of it.

204
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,040
Perhaps you were solely seeking revenge,

205
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
but you haven't realized that

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,360
what Lady Chen gazed upon until her

207
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,560
last breath was that hidden compartment

208
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,160
in the beam where the cloth was concealed.

209
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,160
[Perhaps she wanted to speak,]

210
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,040
but she never had the chance.

211
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,360
It was all my fault.

212
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,240
It was entirely my fault.

213
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,920
I shouldn't have kept

214
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
the truth hidden for so many years.

215
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
I was scared to death.

216
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,800
[In my attempt to protect my family,]

217
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,840
I ended up causing harm to so many.

218
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,720
I deserve to pay for this!

219
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,880
The truth can't be concealed forever.

220
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,920
The truth will soon be laid bare

221
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
for all to see.

222
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,960
Mr. Kong,

223
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,960
I owe you an apology.

224
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,480
It was my fear of death

225
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
that led me to be coerced

226
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,360
into hastily closing the case.

227
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,360
[I never anticipated,]

228
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
[I never anticipate...]

229
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,560
Coerced?

230
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,040
Who was it that coerced you?

231
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,080
You must tell me!

232
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,560
What good is it to admit your mistakes?

233
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
So many innocent lives were lost.

234
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,360
Many wronged souls

235
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,640
are unable to find peace.

236
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
[As a public official,]

237
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
[you feared the true culprit]

238
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,400
[and chose to cover up the truth.]

239
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
Even if you admit your mistakes now,

240
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,200
can those people

241
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
ever return to life?

242
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,720
Who was it that coerced you?

243
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,160
Fire moth, fire moth!

244
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,720
[Chen Huo'e, Chen Huo'e!]

245
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,720
Chen Huo'e, Chen Huo'e!

246
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,080
Chen Huo'e again?

247
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
[This is impossible!]

248
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,800
I didn't kill the wrong person.

249
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,560
She was the true murderer.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
She wouldn't trick me.

251
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
Then who instructed you

252
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,680
to lure Yan Xing to Mingsheng Temple?

253
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,680
I was truly manipulated...

254
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
I was being used...

255
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,760
All that laugh,

256
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
like moths drawn to the flame.

257
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,840
But they do not realize

258
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,760
that like mayflies, fleeting in life,

259
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
they do not enter the cycle of reincarnation.

260
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,560
Moths that brave the fire do not perish,

261
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,960
but are reborn anew.

262
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,560
Ji Fangming, get a hold of yourself!

263
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,240
Kong Xianrong cried for justice till his last gasp.

264
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,240
He sought innocence,

265
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
a revelation of truth.

266
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,960
Yet you've been blinded by hatred,

267
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,800
[manipulated by others to commit murder.]

268
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,440
How is this any different from

269
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,520
those who framed

270
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,760
the Jinxiu Shop?

271
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
[Now that the evidence is irrefutable,]

272
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,280
you still stand here spreading falsehoods.

273
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
Lord Shen,

274
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,720
Chen Huo has returned from the dead,

275
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,600
and exposed the other perpetrators

276
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,160
in the case to me.

277
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,480
Don't you want to know who they are?

278
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
The true perpetrator is

279
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,560
Princess Ying!

280
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,800
[She's envious of the capable,]

281
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,960
[and has long harbored resentment]

282
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,720
[towards Princess Runing.]

283
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,800
[She exploited the Jinxiu Shop]

284
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,240
[to frame Princess Runing for treason.]

285
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,360
Be quiet!

286
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
Not just her,

287
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,800
but also Prince Xian!

288
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
He refuses to be subservient to

289
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,160
[Princess Ying, plotting to seize power]

290
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,240
[and eliminate rivals!]

291
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,320
And also,

292
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,520
the Great Grandmother!

293
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,840
They are all murderers!

294
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,200
Each one of you

295
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,280
[is culpable in this crime!]

296
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,440
You are slandering the royal family,

297
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,840
defaming Her Royal Highness.

298
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,160
You simply want to create a scene

299
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,880
to reopen this case.

300
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,560
Lord Shen!

301
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,920
this matter is serious, indeed!

302
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,920
Reopening the case involves many parties.

303
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,800
Do not bring trouble upon yourself.

304
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,120
Just disregard this madman's rants.

305
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
Ignore them,

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
ignore them!

307
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,200
Wu Taiming,

308
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,280
you wretched dog!

309
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,840
I am not insane.

310
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
I am

311
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
perfectly lucid.

312
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
[Every word I speak comes from the heart.]

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
I wonder if Lord Shen

314
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,960
dares to report my words

315
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
exactly as I said

316
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,080
to the Great Grandmother!

317
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
You truly seem to wish

318
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,840
for a quick death.

319
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
If my death

320
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,080
could appease those spirits

321
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,280
in heaven,

322
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,120
then it's worth it.

323
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If so,

324
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,160
I will do as you wish.

325
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Regarding today's interrogation,

326
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
I will report truthfully to

327
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,520
Her Royal Highness.

328
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,600
Lord Lai,

329
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,120
what are your thoughts?

330
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,120
Lord Shen is the presiding judge,

331
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,440
the Imperial Inspectorate

332
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
is merely here to observe

333
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,400
the case of the murder.

334
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
[How the Imperial Guard decides]

335
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,480
is entirely up to you.

336
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,520
One stays detached,

337
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,480
the other is crafty.

338
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,600
[Each of them keeps their hands clean.]

339
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,880
I, Ji Fangming, expresses gratitude to

340
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,680
Lord Shen for the unjustly slain people

341
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
from the Jinxiu Incident.

342
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,800
Today, I have witnessed

343
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
the cleverness and courage of

344
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,560
Secretary Yan.

345
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,880
I wonder if you'd be interested in working

346
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,480
with me at the Imperial Inspectorate.

347
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
I am in need of

348
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,480
capable minds like you.

349
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,120
Lord Wu

350
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,840
wouldn't be so petty

351
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,800
[as to hold onto talent, would you?]

352
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,760
Lord Lai, you are just making fun of me.

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,800
[Though]

354
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,880
[Yan Xing works for Ministry of Justice,]

355
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,840
she is also the wife of

356
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,520
Lord Shen of the Imperial Guard.

357
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
Lord Lai,

358
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,800
you're not planning to recruit my wife

359
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
right in front of me, are you?

360
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,520
Apologies, Lord Shen.

361
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,880
I seem to be

362
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
a bit abrupt and inconsiderate.

363
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
I merely wanted

364
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,840
to recruit some talent for my own office.

365
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,680
You seem to be overly concerned.

366
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,440
Overly concerned?

367
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,960
After all these years,

368
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,800
Lord Lai,

369
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,000
your ability to retaliate

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,680
hasn't changed at all.

371
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,920
In official matters,

372
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,800
family should remain separate.

373
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,960
With Lord Shen's approach,

374
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,320
I'm afraid that Secretary Yan

375
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,280
spends every day with you solving cases,

376
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,160
and it wouldn't be pleasant for her.

377
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,640
Moreover,

378
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,000
[allow the best to be chosen,]

379
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,520
[and don't block their way to success,]

380
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,400
She has great prospects ahead.

381
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,920
You shouldn't stand in her way.

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
I'm quite comfortable

383
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,600
where I am now.

384
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
[I'm the kind of girl]

385
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,840
[who enjoys comfort and laziness,]

386
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,640
and I'm not quite ready to change places.

387
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,880
Gratitude, Lord Lai

388
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,960
for your concern.

389
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
If so,

390
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,160
I will wait and see.

391
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,680
Let's see how good

392
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,640
your choice is.

393
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,280
It's said that husband and wife are birds

394
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,960
of the same woods, yet when the storm comes,

395
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,040
each takes to the wing alone.

396
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,520
Lord Wu,

397
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,199
what are your thoughts?

398
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,360
Er...

399
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,240
I must admit, I'm rather dull-witted,

400
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,080
[and I struggle to grasp]

401
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:41,720
[the intricacies of love.]

402
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,120
[I truly cannot comprehend.]

403
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,760
What a fitting phrase.

404
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,720
Quite intriguing.

405
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
[this matter is serious, indeed serious.]

406
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,320
[Reopening the case involves many parties.]

407
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,360
[Do not bring trouble upon yourself.]

408
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,040
[How the Imperial Guard decides]

409
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,120
[is entirely up to you.]

410
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,440
What's on your mind?

411
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,880
You seem lost in thought.

412
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,280
I'm feeling quite exhausted.

413
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,040
I really need to take a proper rest.

414
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,480
Is something amiss?

415
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
Yun Que seems particularly

416
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,000
invested in this interrogation.

417
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,680
The case of the Jinxiu Shop,

418
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,840
she came here specifically for this.

419
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,560
Now,

420
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,680
she can no longer contain herself.

421
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,200
So,

422
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
you intentionally kept her in here

423
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
to determine

424
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,360
whether her presence was mere coincidence

425
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,360
or if someone was manipulating

426
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,320
events from behind the scenes.

427
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,840
Jing Lin has looked into her,

428
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,120
and she genuinely doesn't

429
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,480
know much.

430
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,560
However...

431
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,720
What?

432
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, her parents

433
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,400
had significant business dealings

434
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,240
with the Jinxiu Shop back in the day.

435
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,160
Yet they were not implicated.

436
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
If they hid evidence for

437
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,520
self-preservation,

438
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,400
then why,

439
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
after Chen Huo'e appeared,

440
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,840
did she steal evidence to seek justice?

441
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,240
Isn't that a bit too coincidental?

442
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,200
If so,

443
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,800
why don't you just

444
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,240
ask them directly?

445
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,000
It's not a good time.

446
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,960
And it wouldn't be easy to

447
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,880
ensure their safety to testify.

448
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,840
Our actions are visible, but

449
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,440
our enemies operate from the obscurity.

450
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,120
Just leave it

451
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
all to me.

452
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,240
However,

453
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
it involves many parties.

454
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,480
Even Wu Taiming and Lai Luozhi

455
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,960
are eager to distance themselves.

456
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
It seems the truth

457
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,120
is far beyond my expectations.

458
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,600
It might be even more complicated.

459
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,560
I didn't expect

460
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,920
that the fearless Yan Xing

461
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,240
to have her fair share of fear.

462
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Do you truly

463
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,360
intend to report

464
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
Ji Fangming's

465
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,360
heretical words?

466
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Regarding the case,

467
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
I made a promise to someone

468
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,280
to investigate it personally.

469
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,680
Someone?

470
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,680
Would that be Princess Runing?

471
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,400
Ignorance brings no fear,

472
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,120
but knowledge brings deep fear.

473
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,200
I've come to understand

474
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,800
the difference in our courage.

475
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,960
You anticipated this day long ago,

476
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,920
yet you remain so calm.

477
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,840
This doesn't sound like

478
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,160
the usual you.

479
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,520
If you had heard of

480
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,800
a wrongful conviction,

481
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,440
you would have jumped up to investigate.

482
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,920
No one could stop you.

483
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,280
That's for sure.

484
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,720
Injustice must be addressed.

485
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,800
Grievance must be voiced.

486
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,240
That's what it means to be an official.

487
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,960
That's how we live up to our wage.

488
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,080
However,

489
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,960
I also understand

490
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,080
what it means to

491
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,240
reopen the case.

492
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,080
By his testimonies alone,

493
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,680
I'm afraid...

494
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,000
You are becoming wiser.

495
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,880
This wrongful case

496
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,960
caused quite a stir.

497
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,240
It continues to haunt

498
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
numerous people.

499
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,760
[With the reopening of the case,]

500
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,280
the shadows of the past

501
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,320
will inevitably resurface.

502
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,240
And then,

503
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,560
no one will be able to escape its grasp.

504
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,400
That's absolutely true.

505
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,720
They intend to use him

506
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,000
to draw public attention to

507
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,280
the Jinxiu Shop case, thereby

508
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,280
casting suspicion on the royal family

509
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
and inciting unrest.

510
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
Ultimately,

511
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,880
he should come to realize

512
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,360
that he was being manipulated.

513
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,480
Yet he had no other options.

514
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
How tragic.

515
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,080
And pathetic.

516
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,840
What's your level of confidence

517
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,240
in the Jinxiu Shop case?

518
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,760
That's precisely why I'm concerned.

519
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,920
It has been closed for years.

520
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,760
If you bring it up to Her Royal Highness,

521
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,320
and she refuses to reopen it,

522
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,600
that's just one issue.

523
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,920
If she were to take her anger out on you,

524
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,640
that would be...

525
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,440
So after leaving the Ministry of Justice,

526
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,360
you've been anxious all along.

527
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,480
You're worried about me.

528
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,400
I didn't!

529
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,120
[I'm worried you'll involve me in this.]

530
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,000
After all,

531
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,160
I currently hold

532
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,360
the title of primary wife

533
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,320
in Shen residence.

534
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,680
I have to take the safety

535
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,600
of everyone in Shen residence

536
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
into account.

537
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,680
[Every party's position is quite difficult.]

538
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,520
The wronged wish to reopen the case,

539
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,440
while Her Royal Highness seeks only

540
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,880
peace in the realm

541
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,280
and the well-being of the people.

542
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,040
What about you?

543
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,720
Don't worry about me.

544
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,760
Just leave it

545
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,160
to me.

546
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,880
No, I didn't.

547
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,800
Then I'll leave her

548
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,320
to you, my dear.

549
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,200
Since you know she's trouble,

550
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,560
why do you still keep her around?

551
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,640
She might possess

552
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
another crucial evidence.

553
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,920
So that is your reasoning, huh?

554
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,200
White Death truly is cold-hearted,

555
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,840
only bringing more trouble.

556
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,640
So,

557
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,360
Jing Lin,

558
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,400
you should keep tabs on Yun Que.

559
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,760
If the opportunity arises,

560
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,520
you should

561
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,920
see if she is still concealing anything

562
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,000
about the Jinxiu Shop case.

563
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,120
Understood.

564
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,560
Could you abduct someone for me?

565
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,800
Not actually abducting someone.

566
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
I just need you

567
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,440
to make a trip to Jiangnan

568
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,240
and safely escort him to Xiang'an.

569
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,680
Jiangnan?

570
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
Isn't Yun Que, who is currently living in

571
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,160
your residence and competing with you

572
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,040
for the title of wife, also from Jiangnan?

573
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,480
Are you a bit jealous?

574
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,240
And...

575
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,400
Pretty, please!

576
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,960
C'mon, please!

577
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,560
Chichi...

578
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,600
it's something only you can help me with.

579
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm counting on you!

580
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,160
It's not a huge deal,

581
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,320
just a bit

582
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,600
of legwork.

583
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
You can count on me.

584
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
When you return,

585
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,520
I'll definitely treat you to a lavish meal

586
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,120
and offer you some fine brews.

587
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,800
And I can tell that

588
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,600
you're not just an ordinary merchant.

589
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,400
But I assure you, I won't expose you

590
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,160
or cause you any trouble.

591
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,080
Are you trying to threaten me?

592
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,720
Absolutely not!

593
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,400
How could I dare?

594
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,960
After all, we

595
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,680
are friends who support each other.

596
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Just friends, huh?

597
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,000
What did you say?

598
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,360
Nothing.

599
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,880
Then I'll be waiting for your treat.

600
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,400
By the way.

601
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,240
Here.

602
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,160
Take this with you

603
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,840
along the way.

604
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,560
What's this?

605
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,360
These are the names of the victims

606
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,640
that Chen Huo'e murdered back then.

607
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,680
This is...

608
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,040
About those that have been crossed out

609
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
the crime scenes are all located near

610
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Xiang'an, or in close proximity.

611
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,960
There are a few places you'll pass by,

612
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,840
so you might as well investigate

613
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,920
the circumstances of the deceased.

614
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,080
Trying to snag a free meal from you

615
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,000
is quite the challenge.

616
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,760
By the way,

617
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,840
here,

618
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,720
take this with you.

619
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,960
I just acquired it.

620
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,160
What do I need a fan for?

621
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,720
Are there some hidden tricks?

622
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,320
You should be cautious.

623
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
This has a mechanism.

624
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,000
The handle is hollow,

625
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,760
and it can hold powder inside.

626
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,240
Just a gentle sprinkle,

627
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,760
and you can discreetly

628
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
disperse the powder.

629
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,040
The handle is hollow...

630
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,480
Is this for poisoning?

631
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,520
Not quite.

632
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,240
The so-called hidden weapons

633
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,600
depend on the user

634
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,560
and the context of its use.

635
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,560
You're giving me such a unique item?

636
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,360
Are you...

637
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Are you...

638
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,760
Are you planning to use it to extort me?

639
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,720
Just hold onto it for now.

640
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,640
If you find it useful,

641
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,720
you can always pay me later.

642
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,440
Isn't that still a form of extortion?

643
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,760
Does it contain poison?

644
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,800
Not that it would be lethal,

645
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,840
but it could easily

646
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
put a cow to sleep.

647
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,600
[Have you all heard?]

648
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600
[The ruins of the Jinxiu Shop]

649
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,520
[have shown miracles again.]

650
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,160
[Really?]

651
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,000
[A swarm of moths is flying into the walls,]

652
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,320
[their blood forming characters.]

653
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,440
[These flying insects]

654
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,400
[are crying out for justice.]

655
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,480
The resurrected Chen Huo'e...

656
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,080
So eerie.

657
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,120
Is seeking revenge on the true culprit.

658
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,080
[That incident]

659
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,720
[happened years ago.]

660
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,440
[Why is it suddenly like this?]

661
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,880
[Haven't you heard?]

662
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,640
Someone died because of the

663
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,680
[Jinxiu Shop incident again.]

664
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,440
[This has caused unrest among the people.]

665
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
This must be a wrongful conviction.

666
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,400
So many died tragically back then,

667
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,480
and they haven't been vindicated.

668
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,920
[That's why they linger in this world.]

669
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,680
These vengeful spirits

670
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,520
won't just randomly take a life, right?

671
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,560
We are all innocent, after all.

672
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,560
I've heard

673
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,000
[that only by reopening this case]

674
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,080
[and delivering justice to the deceased]

675
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,960
[can these vengeful spirits]

676
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,560
[finally find peace.]

677
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,720
Why aren't you eating?

678
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,640
Dig in, or the noodles will clump.

679
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
You came back so late.

680
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,720
You ate outside, right?

681
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,720
Of course.

682
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,080
No matter how tough or tiring it gets,

683
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,640
I won't let my belly suffer.

684
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,120
I've been quite busy

685
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,800
these past few days,

686
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,000
and it's really worn me out.

687
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,080
Eat!

688
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,080
Let me tell you,

689
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,160
I investigated the workshop tonight,

690
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,880
and I saw what looked like ghostly lights

691
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
floating in the air.

692
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,320
There was something drifting around,

693
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,960
but I couldn't see them clearly.

694
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,480
This must be

695
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,560
what the common people refer to as

696
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,120
ghostly shadows.

697
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,680
On my way back,

698
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,320
I noticed that

699
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,760
that every household along the street

700
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,480
near the Jinxiu Shop

701
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,880
had hung these fire moth jades

702
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,640
at their doors.

703
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,600
Investigating alone at night,

704
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,040
don't you find it eerie?

705
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,360
Those are all mere illusions.

706
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,000
It must be that so-called

707
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,840
reborn Chen Huo'e

708
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,920
causing all this stir.

709
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,160
As for ghostly lights,

710
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,000
I often

711
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
see them in graveyards during summer.

712
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,520
My master once told me

713
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,960
that they appear after a body decays,

714
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,800
due to some

715
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,240
undetectable substance

716
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,680
being ignited

717
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,000
in the dry air.

718
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,600
The method of ghostly shadows

719
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,120
should be quite similar.

720
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,720
It's just a quick-moving

721
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,560
shadow of a black bird.

722
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,360
I knew it.

723
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,800
You seem to know all this.

724
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,960
Were you doing this on purpose?

725
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,920
The Jinxiu Shop

726
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,000
should have been guarded by

727
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,080
the guardsmen from the Imperial Guard.

728
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,680
But this afternoon,

729
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,520
when the moths flew into the walls,

730
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,080
showing what they call a miracle,

731
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,120
they didn't drive the people away.

732
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,760
Jing Lin was clearly nearby,

733
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,480
but he just watched from a distance.

734
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,440
So?

735
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,320
The IG has a lot on the plate.

736
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,160
Ji Fangming has already been apprehended.

737
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,960
There's no need to worry about those.

738
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,240
Aren't you the one waiting?

739
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,240
Waiting for what?

740
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,720
Waiting for some

741
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,160
wind that could help reopen

742
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,920
the Jinxiu Shop case.

743
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,120
You only went out for a bit,

744
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,800
and ended up with an extra item.

745
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,360
Be careful with it.

746
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Don't fool around with it.

747
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,760
Careful.

748
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,120
Why so tense?

749
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,320
Who gave it to you?

750
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,280
I still haven't paid

751
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,800
for this fan yet.

752
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,040
Don't break it.

753
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,320
Is that so?

754
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,400
Why have you been

755
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,160
acting so strangely lately?

756
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,240
Really?

757
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,640
Yes.

758
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,720
If the medicinal dishes

759
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,240
are not prepared in the future,

760
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,360
you must eat on time.

761
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,520
Don't skip meals.

762
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,600
And also,

763
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,640
you must not say

764
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
something weird all of a sudden,

765
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,080
and then

766
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,240
act all scary.

767
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,320
And you must not suddenly...

768
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,480
Suddenly what?

769
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
Just suddenly...

770
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,680
No wasting food.

771
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,120
Alright.

772
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,480
Deal.

773
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,040
But in the future,

774
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,160
you must not engage in

775
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,400
dangerous activities like

776
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,720
investigating at night.

777
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,040
Fortunately, tonight I had people arranged

778
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,120
to keep watch around.

779
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,320
Or else...

780
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
You really don't take your life seriously.

781
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,240
Just this time, I'll let you off the hook.

782
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,240
I won't allow it in the future.

783
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,280
[What's going on?]

784
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,120
[I feel so dizzy.]

785
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,360
[No way.]

786
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,720
[Pan Chi!]

787
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,920
[I'm totally screwed because of you.]

788
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,800
Yan Xing!

789
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,920
Put a cow to sleep...

790
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,120
What the...

791
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,200
Smells so good.

792
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,200
You got all the good deals...

793
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm not allowed to...

794
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,440
Not allowed to...

795
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,480
It seems I should be the one

796
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,200
to pay for this fan.

797
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,960
Let her sleep peacefully,

798
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,160
no need to wake her.

799
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,880
Yes, my lord.

800
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,920
[Ji Fangming is quite the character.]

801
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,360
Not only has he shown disrespect

802
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,920
by lacking the manners of a subject,

803
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,160
but he also dared to use the case

804
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,400
to frame Prince Xian and

805
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,160
Princess Ying.

806
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,520
[His crimes are unforgivable.]

807
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,640
Your Royal Highness,

808
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
[Ji Fangming's numerous evil deeds]

809
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,760
[make his death not worth mourning,]

810
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,800
yet there are puppeteers

811
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,080
in the shadows,

812
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,720
exploiting his fixations

813
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
to sow fear.

814
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,480
Who is behind this?

815
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,760
It's precisely the one who was arrested

816
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
and committed suicide five years ago,

817
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
the serial killer,

818
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,240
Chen Huo'e.

819
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,440
What?

820
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,440
A dead person

821
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,880
can still stir up trouble

822
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,400
in Xiang'an City?

823
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,120
I remember back then,

824
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,840
this case was investigated

825
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,280
by you personally, Lai Luozhi.

826
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,120
What on earth is going on?

827
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,320
Your Royal Highness,

828
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,680
back then, the case of Chen Huo'e

829
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
caused great panic among the people.

830
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,760
So I

831
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,120
publicly executed Chen Huo'e

832
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,880
after capturing her.

833
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,640
At that time,

834
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,600
half of the citizens of Xiang'an City

835
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,720
saw Chen Huo’e

836
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,080
commit suicide in public.

837
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,640
In front of everyone,

838
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,600
her body was thrown into a mass grave.

839
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,120
It's just...

840
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,520
What?

841
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
It's just that Chen Huo’e publicly stated

842
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,280
that she would come back to life.

843
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,200
So you mean

844
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,560
that she really has come back to life?

845
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,480
Recently,

846
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,040
there have indeed been rumors

847
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,160
saying that Chen Huo’e has appeared,

848
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,760
[and there is a group of followers]

849
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,040
[who believe this one is the Chen Huo’e]

850
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,760
[who committed suicide five years ago.]

851
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,880
But I believe

852
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
it's just that some people

853
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,400
are using this to create trouble

854
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,080
and incite the public.

855
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,680
My trusted officials,

856
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Chen Huo'e has fabricated a divine sign,

857
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,840
[leading the populace to doubt]

858
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,080
[the fairness of a past case.]

859
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,920
The Imperial Guard has requested

860
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,440
that Chen Huo’e and

861
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,080
the  Jinxiu Shop cases

862
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,240
should be combined and re-examined.

863
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,760
What are your thoughts on this?

864
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,160
Your Highness cares for the people deeply.

865
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,800
Now, Lord Shen

866
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,000
intends to re-examine this case.

867
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
I believe there's nothing wrong with that.

868
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,800
Lord Lai,

869
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,680
do you have any insights?

870
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
I believe that

871
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,040
the past case being suddenly brought up

872
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,600
may have hidden motives.

873
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,960
However,

874
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,320
whether the case will disturb

875
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,720
the peace of Xiang'an City

876
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,000
I dare not speculate.

877
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,560
Your Royal Highness,

878
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,680
I just pulled out the previous records

879
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,120
and after careful examination, I found

880
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,360
that there are still unresolved doubts.

881
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,520
Your Royal Highness has always been

882
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
perceptive and cares for the people.

883
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,000
I know this matter is difficult,

884
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,400
but I wouldn't dare to hold any details.

885
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,920
Your Royal Highness,

886
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,840
I believe

887
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,360
what Lord Shen stated makes sense.

888
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,680
If we can get to the bottom of this

889
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,920
and bring peace and comfort to the people,

890
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,480
it'd surely be in line with mother's wishes.

891
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,600
Moreover, it would reveal to the world

892
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,400
Your Highness' genuine concern for

893
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,360
easing the people's burdens.

894
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,520
What a "easing the people's burdens."

895
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,360
Lord Shen,

896
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,000
I will entrust this case

897
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,600
to you completely.

898
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,600
You must thoroughly investigate it.

899
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,600
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

900
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,560
I'll not disappoint your expectations

901
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,160
and will capture the perpetrator soon.

902
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
What's your thought on Lord Shen

903
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,240
reinvestigating this case?

904
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,360
The incident back then

905
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,760
caused great panic among the people.

906
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,080
I shall take my leave.

907
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,280
Your Highness have never

908
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
interfered too much in court affairs.

909
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,160
This time, you might

910
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,680
have attracted attention.

911
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,560
Sir,

912
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,840
I didn't think too much this time.

913
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,800
I just wanted to see how Shen Du

914
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,360
would handle this case.

915
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,400
Back then, Princess Runing was

916
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,600
implicated in the Jinxiu Shop case.

917
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,440
There were already voices suspecting

918
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,920
that it was the work of Princess Ying

919
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,960
who was at odds with her.

920
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,480
Should this reexamination of the past case

921
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,840
genuinely uncover

922
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,240
a link to Princess Ying,

923
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,160
it would be a tremendous

924
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,360
advantage for us.

925
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,760
We can leverage their actions

926
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
to help us root out our enemy.

927
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,800
Sir, that's actually unnecessary.

928
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
I merely wish to

929
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,480
uncover the truth.
