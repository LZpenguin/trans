[My lord, Her Highness]

[has granted you a marriage.]

[Should we start making preparations?]

6
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,760
Uncle Zhong,

7
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
you don't need to lift a finger.

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,440
With me, the guardian, here,

9
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
there's no way she'll get into the manor.

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,640
[Again with that]

[technique of yours to scare people?]

13
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,640
[This was granted by Her Highness herself.]

14
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Maybe it's...

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,280
[So what?]

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,200
[We'll do as we always did.]

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,200
[We'll scare her away.]

18

[Prime Minister Zhang,]

19
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,920
[maybe...]

20
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,680
[Enough.]

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
[Say no more.]

22

[Just do as I said.]

23
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,200
Yan the Erudite,

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
you're a bright man.

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,120
I believe you surely

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,040
will live up to my trust in you.

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,600
Prime Minister Zhang, rest assured.

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,960
Close the door.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,480
[My lord,]

30
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,120
what was it for that

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
Chancellor Zhang had come here himself.

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,280
Shen Du has always refrained

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
from getting involved in court factions,

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,800
especially in the conflict between
Prince Xian and Prince Ying.

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
He has always remained neutral.

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,000
[Prime Minister Zhang is Prince Xian's]

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
[strategist. Choosing Caiwei this time]

38
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,680
surely isn't just because of her talent.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He wants to use Caiwei as an informant?

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,240
Keep your voice down.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,440
[No.]

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,280
Then Caiwei definitely can't marry him.

43
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,680
Just now, Prime Minister Zhang has brought up

44
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,280
again the re-election in the Ministries.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,840
[If Caiwei refuses to marry,]

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,720
then during the election,

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,520
I'll be assigned to guard the desert,

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,840
and our whole family will relocate there.

49

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,000
[we have trouble!]

53

Caiwei... Caiwei ran off.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,680

55

63

Did you find Caiwei?

64

69

Go, go, go. Go ahead now!

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,920
Wait.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,200
Keep it a secret.

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,960
Don't let anyone know that

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,840
Don't say that Caiwei has run away.

76
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Just say that,

77
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,440
Yes.

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,080
And you're close to Caiwei.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,680
Go look for her as well.

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,560
Sure.

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,680
Then, I'll go look for the rabbit too.

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,080
Okay.

87
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,200
Yan Xing.

Why are you always wandering around outside?

91

Chief Shen, please move aside.

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,320
My rabbit is missing.

93
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm looking for it.

94
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,560
Is that so?

95
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,280
You lost your rabbit?

96
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,760
The Yan residence's gate

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,400
has been shut all day.

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,640
[I thought you were busy]

99
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,520
[making preparations for the wedding.]

100
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,160
Turns out you were looking for a rabbit.

101
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,040
Chief Shen, if you're done mocking me,

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,280
I need to keep looking.

103
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,000
[You must find it then.]

104
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Tomorrow is my wedding

105
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,200
with your sister.

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
[I really look forward]

107
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
to seeing you there

108
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,480
with your rabbit.

109
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,600
Chief Shen,

110
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
please forgive my impudence.

111
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
I need to ask you for a favor.

112
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Ask me?

113
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,800
Aside from the prisoners

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,440
in the dungeon who are desperate to die,

115
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,640
I doubt you could find anyone else

116
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,080
in the entire Da Cang who would

117
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,920
ask me for a favor.

118
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,200
Chief Shen, please break off the engagement.

119
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Do you know what you're talking about?

120
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,920
Yes.

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Please, Chief Shen,

122
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,440
break off the engagement with my sister.

123
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,400
Although you hold no official position,

124
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,960
[you are at least a clerk]

125
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
[knowing how to read.]

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,840
Do you know what

127
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,280
'Heaven's will cannot be defied' means?

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Her Highness's words are absolute.

129
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,800
Who am I to break it off.

130
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,160
Her Highness

131
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,119
holds Chief Shen in high regard,

132
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,800
naturally she wishes to match you

133
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,040
with a suitable spouse.

134
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,840
Right.

135
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,960
With Her Highness's careful selection

136
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
and Prime Minister Zhang's endorsement,

137
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,320
I believe your sister would

138
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
surely be a good match to me.

139
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,840
It must be because Her Highness

140
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
doesn't truly know what the daughters

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,360
of the Yan family are like.

142
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
Considering my crude and disrespectful

143
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,120
manners, you should know that

144
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,960
my sister would not be a

145
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
good match for you, Chief Shen.

146
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,800
You're saying that

147
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,560
your sister faked all her talents?

148
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,160
[Deceiving for fame like this is]

149
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,560
essentially a crime against the emperor.

150
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,360
I...

151
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,000
I was talking about me.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,640
You are indeed crude and disrespectful.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,480
But I'm not marrying you.

154
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,760
[It's very unfortunate]

155
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,400
for your sister to have a sister

156
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,840
like you.

157
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,000
But you've never even met

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
my sister,

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,080
[aren't you afraid that]

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
you won't get along well

161
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,520
and become estranged?

162
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,280
It doesn't matter.

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
How can it not matter?

164
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,520
People should be with the one

165
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,360
they love.

166
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,440
Respect each other.

167
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
Cherish each other.

168
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Only this way can you be happy.

169
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
That's not important.

170
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,560
You...

171
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,280
You're truly hopeless.

172
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,320
Can't talk sense to you!

173
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
The audacity!

174
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,160
Shen Du,

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,280
even if I don't want to

176
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,440
believe the rumors,

177
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,440
but look at what you're like now,

178
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
mean,

179
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
eccentric,

180
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,280
ruthless

181
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,680
and unreasonable.

182
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,960
Even if my sister

183
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,200
has no one in her heart,

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,560
she still wouldn't marry you!

185
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,120
[Respect each other.]

186
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,720
[Cherish each other.]

187
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
These things

188
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,000
are too far out of the reach for me now.

189
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,760
Mother,

190
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,680
someday,

191
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,920
I will relocate you to the

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,080
most noble and grand cemetery, where you

193
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,800
will receive endless tributes and honors.

194
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
My lord,

195
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,560
everything's ready.

196
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Chief Shen,

197
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,000
[Yan Xing’s]

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,080
[words were very harsh,]

199
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
[but,]

200
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,080
[didn't you disagree]

201
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
[this marriage either?]

202
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,760
Now that they want to break it off

203
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,000
before we even scare them,

204
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,920
why not turn their trick in your favor?

205
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,360
Of course I can't get married with her.

206
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,800
But I

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
can't be the one that says this.

208
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Exactly.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,400
[Her Highness granted you this marriage,]

210
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,920
[of course you have to accept it.]

211
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,560
The Yans will have to be the ones

212
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,880
who break it off.

213
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,960
Our informant says,

214
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,760
Caiwei ran off with

215
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,160
that scholar,

216
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,400
[and they still haven't found her yet.]

217
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,160
[Even if they don't break it off,]

218
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,480
[tomorrow, we won't need to send the]

219
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,800
[bridal party to pick up the bride.]

220
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,000
[They are in the wrong.]

221
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,680
Prime Minister Zhang will naturally

222
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,040
have to find a way to smooth this over

223
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,320
with Her Highness.

224
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,960
That's a part of the story.

225
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,400
It's the Yans' problem

226
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,640
where the bride is.

227
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,240
But of course

228
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,480
I'll still send the bridal party

229
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,840
to pick up the bride tomorrow morning.

230
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,560
You have all

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,600
been with the Yan family for many years.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
Now the Yan family is in such a crisis.

233
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,200
[Looks like heaven is determined to end us.]

234
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
I have prepared some silvers for all of you.

235
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,480
[Go and find a new place for yourselves.]

236
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
I've already written my will.

237
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,600
Mother,

238
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,200
I don't want to die, Mother.

239
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,520
[Mother.]

240
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,160
[Mother.]

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,160
[-Mother.]
-Fine.

242
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,280
I'll marry him.

243
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,760
[It's getting late.]

244
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,480
[Why does the bride not show up?]

245
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
[We're missing the auspicious hour.]

246
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,960
Xing.

247
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,520
Xing, no, wait. Xing!

248
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,640
[Xing.]

249
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,440
I just don't think this is right.

250
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,160
Think about

251
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,840
who The White Death really is.

252
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
He crawled out of the dead bodies

253
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,720
at Shen residence.

254
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,520
What good can it do to you if you marry him.

255
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
Run away now.

256
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Take this.

257
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,960
You know people in the Ministry of Justice.

258
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,320
Just find some place

259
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,560
[to hide for three months.]

260
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,120
[Wait for all this to blow over,]

261
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,960
[then you can come home.]

262
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,480
You don't need to worry about me.

263
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Your father bluffs like a paper tiger.

264
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,320
[He won't prey on me.]

265
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,159
At most, I'll just

266
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,000
take really good care of him from now on.

267
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
[I'll bring him tea, give him massages.]

268
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,159
Worse comes to worst,

269
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,120
you can just

270
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,199
divorce me.

271
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,880
I'll pick up my old job

272
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:43,760
and sing operas.

273
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,000
I can support you and me.

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
Mom,

275
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,240
which theater would take in

276
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,000
someone of your age.

277
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,320
Although I'm the daughter of a concubine,

278
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,040
I haven't faced any hardships

279
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,560
because of your care and protection.

280
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,600
Caiwei was especially good to me.

281
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,440
Back then,

282
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
when I didn't want to study needlework and

283
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,560
was determined to be a female official,

284
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,480
it was Caiwei

285
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,720
who knelt and begged all night

286
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,640
for me.

287
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,200
You silly girl,

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,920
you only remember other people's good.

289
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,440
I'm a part of the Yan family.

290
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,000
Of course I can't watch

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,640
and do nothing at a moment like this.

292
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,160
Caiwei didn't want to marry him

293
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,960
because she loves Han Shiyuan.

294
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,560
But I have no one.

295
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,840
I'll just take her place.

296
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,960
Foolish girl,

297
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
marriage is not that simple.

298
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,960
Mom,

299
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,880
don't worry.

300
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,760
I have seen enough deaths in

301
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,920
the Ministry of Justice.

302
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,120
The White Death,

303
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
I can handle him.

304
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,760
Plus,

305
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,720
he's still made of flesh and blood.

306
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,520
What can he do to me

307
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,800
anyway?

308
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,920
[Okay, now.]

309
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
Father,

310
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,440
Mother.

311
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,840
Please take care of my mom for me.

312
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,640
I

313
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,160
bid you goodbye.

314
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,200
[The bride is here.]

315
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,400
[Chief Shen,]

316
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
[before the ceremony, the bride]

317
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,120
[and the groom can't see each other.]

318
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,840
[It brings bad luck stopping halfway.]

319
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
[And you the broom]

320
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,600
[isn't even dressed up yet.]

321
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,400
[Shut up.]

322
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,640
[The Imperial Guard is]

323
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,280
picking up the bride, just do as we say.

324
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
The Chief Shen will decide if it

325
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
brings bad luck or not.

326
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,160
But...

327
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,600
My lady,

328
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,320
please allow me to see

329
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,400
the face of this knowledgeable

330
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,840
and virtuous

331
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,640
noble lady of the Yan family.

332
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,440
The so called noble lady

333
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,360
is me.

334
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Chief Shen, are you going to kill your wife

335
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
in front of everyone?

336
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,200
Don't forget this marriage

337
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,920
was granted by Her Highness.

338
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,000
[Although I don't hold an official rank]

339
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,720
[and am not a court-appointed official,]

340
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,160
I'm still a clerk at the Ministry of Justice.

341
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,200
[This is not a crime scene,]

342
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
[nor is there any hostage situation.]

343
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,520
Even if you are the Chief Shen,

344
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,360
you cannot just kill an innocent clerk

345
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,440
without justification.

346
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,920
Is that so?

347
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
When did a fly can

348
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,280
become a clerk?

349
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,800
Chief Shen, there was no need to insult me.

350
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,000
Now that you hate this marriage

351
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,840
so much,

352
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,200
why not kill me now?

353
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,720
No rush.

354
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,000
Even though today,

355
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,640
this sword didn't touch you,

356
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
soon,

357
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,200
you'll wish you were dead.

358
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,880
Xing is so bold

359
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,800
that she should marry for her sister.

360
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,080
This is a crime against the Emperor.

361
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,440
Her Highness only said

362
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,600
it is a daughter from the Yan family.

363
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,080
As for which daughter,

364
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,800
she couldn't care less.

365
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,840
But you...

366
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,200
I don't care a bit.

367
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
I'll let her go anyway.

368
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
[There are not many interesting rabbits]

369
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,360
[from the Yan family.]

370
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,200
The bolder one

371
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,360
is more interesting.

372
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,120
It's rare.

373
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,520
She's not only bold,

374
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,880
but actually quite smart.

375
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,560
Xing.

376
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,880
[Xing.]

377
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,160
Xing.

378
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,400
Chuichui.

379
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,640
Xing,

380
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,240
it's really you.

381
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,640
[I heard]

382
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
[Caiwei was getting married today]

383
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,640
and was going to find you to

384
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,040
watch the wedding together.

385
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,760
[But,]

386
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
[as soon as I got there,]

387
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,080
[I saw Madame Jin crying at the door,]

388
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,560
saying that you're the one getting married.

389
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,880
[Xing,]

390
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,080
[do you not want to?]

391
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,960
But, isn't the groom

392
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,200
Shen Du?

393
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,280
He's not Shen Du anymore.

394
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,440
He's the ruthless The White Death now.

395
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,680
Chuichui, don't worry.

396
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,640
Go back now.

397
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,720
No.

398
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,280
How can I just watch you

399
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,720
falling into the hands of The White Death?

400
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,760
[I'll go with you,]

401
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,680
[even if]

402
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
it is a trap.

403
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,920
Something's wrong.

404
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,760
What's wrong.

405
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
Clam down. Tell me.

406
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,280
The bride actually came!

407
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,240
The bride?

408
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,120
What kind of rules do they have here?

409
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,880
The Shen residence

410
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,320
looks like a mourning hall.

411
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,960
This doesn't look like a wedding at all.

412
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,280
[And what's with all the white lanterns?]

413
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,640
My lady,

414
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,640
you just got here.

415
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,920
The servants surely dare not be negligent.

416
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,800
Marriage requires

417
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,600
the right timing, place, and harmony.

418
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
A fortune teller

419
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,600
studied the birth date and time

420
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,040
a few days ago.

421
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,120
That's why it's not suitable to

422
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,040
have festive decorations today.

423
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,600
No problem.

424
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,760
You decide, butler.

425
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,120
This way, please.

426
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,640
The main room of the residence

427
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,400
is not suitable as a bridal chamber

428
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,400
because it has been vacant

429
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,320
and lacks a certain harmonious energy,

430
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,760
which could invite misfortune.

431
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,560
A new room has been arranged for you.

432
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,200
[Please get some rest and wait for]

433
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,640
Chief Shen to return from his prayers.

434
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,240
Don't take things too far.

435
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,640
It's okay.

436
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Please, lead the way.

437
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,840
Please.

438
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,080
Butler Shen,

439
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,920
do you still recall

440
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,720
my birth date and time?

441
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,560
Er...

442
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,800
It's not appropriate to

443
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,520
publicly disclose

444
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,800
a woman's birth details.

445
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,080
Thank you for being so considerate.

446
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,760
Please.

447
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,440
[Chuichui,]

448
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,160
have some preserved fruit.

449
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,840
How are you in the mood to eat?

450
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,520
My lady,

451
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,480
may you soon be blessed with a child.

452
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,000
You're doing that now?

453
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,040
Did you think Xing

454
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,760
would never come and marry?

455
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,200
Chuichui,

456
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,800
don't be too harsh on them.

457
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,720
They are truly over the line.

458
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,920
They probably thought I would've

459
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,640
run away halfway.

460
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,280
But this is simply

461
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,480
not acceptable.

462
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,120
It's nothing.

463
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,320
Just formalities.

464
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,520
Formalities?

465
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,480
But your dowry comes too easy.

466
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,760
I heard

467
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,880
all the gifts Shen Du sent to

468
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,960
your family were rubbish,

469
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,320
not one decent thing among them.

470
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,280
You...

471
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,000
may as well

472
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,040
marry into an ordinary family.

473
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,440
Al least they would welcome you

474
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,160
with the best things they can give.

475
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,040
But all you got is a chicken.

476
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,400
How can you still laugh?

477
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,240
If he doesn't want to marry me,

478
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,200
I'd rather insist on marrying him.

479
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,640
Chief Shen,

480
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,040
news from the imperial guards says that

481
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,720
that bride is truly unusual.

482
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,320
Not only did she not run away,

483
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,280
but she actually came back.

484
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,800
She should be at the Shen residence now.

485
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,400
Yan Xing is truly something.

486
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,480
But most importantly,

487
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,560
no one thought this wedding

488
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,280
would happen.

489
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,400
So they didn't prepare anything.

490
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,680
And she

491
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,040
not only joins the decoration,

492
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,640
she's actually giving ideas

493
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,680
herself!

494
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,480
Let her.

495
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,400
There have been many women

496
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,360
who have risked everything to

497
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,320
marry into the Shen residence,

498
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,200
but as soon as you use

499
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,160
a little bit of tactics,

500
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,880
they would run away scared.

501
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,920
No one dared to go in the bridal chamber

502
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,120
after seeing your sword.

503
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,120
After she arrived,

504
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,160
Butler Shen deliberately withheld

505
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,000
her dowry.

506
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,800
She was not angry but
insisted on marrying you.

507
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
This woman is well-trained,

508
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
[and is not afraid of hardships.]

509
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,280
Prime Minister Zhang must have sent her

510
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,560
as part of a grand scheme.

511
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,000
If even you can tell,

512
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,760
what kind of scheme is that?

513
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
This rabbit

514
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,520
is truly much more interesting

515
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,400
than the ones before.

10516
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,040
And the matchmaking official...

517
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,000
Chief Shen, don't worry.

518
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,080
I've already instructed

519
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,240
the bridal party.

520
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,560
By now everyone would assume that

521
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,160
the wedding went well,

522
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
and everything has settled.

523
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,600
Now I know

524
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,400
why they call Shen Du the White Death.

525
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,960
Look at all these rooms.

526
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,400
They looked like mourning halls during

527
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,520
the day, and now at night,

528
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,440
it's still as bright as day.

529
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,880
Are they trying to light up the way

530
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,120
for the ghosts from hell?

531
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,320
[Maybe it's because he became wicked these years,]

532
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,520
[and he fears ghosts might come at night.]

533
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,200
Xing,

534
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,040
do you

535
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,000
really have no feelings left

536
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,440
for White Death?

537
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,040
I was so blind when I was young

538
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,480
and actually thought he was a decent man.

539
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,880
After these two days,

540
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,280
I finally saw him through.

541
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,280
And what he said when he stopped the sedan chair...

542
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,080
He just didn't want me to come here

543
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,320
and was trying to scare me away.

544
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,680
Then what are you going to do?

545
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,400
Don't worry.

546
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,360
This marriage was granted

547
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,560
by Her Highness herself.

548
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,000
He wouldn't harm me

549
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,040
anytime soon.

550
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,920
I'll be very careful.

551
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,440
One day at a time.

552
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,280
At least I'll have to hold on

553
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,040
until after the re-elections,

554
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,800
so my family

555
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,360
wouldn't be sent to the desert.

556
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,080
You didn't get married,

557
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,920
you fell into a monster's nest.

558
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,800
Survival in a dire situation

559
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,000
surely wouldn't be easy.

560
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
It's getting late.

561
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,320
You should go back now.

562
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,520
Your father would be worried.

563
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,160
I'm not going.

564
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,520
I'll stay here with you.

565
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,480
You don't come to me every day, do you?

566
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,480
Are you going to marry into this place too?

567
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,680
Don't worry.

568
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,560
Tonight,

569
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,640
he will definitely act

570
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
all cold and annoyed to me.

571
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,640
He wouldn't come in my room.

572
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Why are you here?

573
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,120
This is the Shen residence.

574
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,880
This is my wedding night.

575
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,400
Why can't I come here?

576
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,960
As for you,

577
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,440
they say the daughter of the Yan family

578
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,000
possesses poetic talent,

579
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,880
is skilled in calligraphy and dance,

580
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,360
good in scholarship,

581
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,800
knowledgeable,

582
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,440
known for her virtue and grace,

583
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,160
and her reputation unparalleled in Xiang'an.

584
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Which of these descriptions

585
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,720
fits you?

586
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Great fit.

587
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,760
Of course, it was Her Highness who believed

588
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,240
I, Yan Xing, would be a

589
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,440
great fit for you.

590
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,440
Or why would she grant this marriage?

591
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,120
Chief Shen, if you're not

592
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,400
content with me,

593
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,000
just divorce me.

594
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
My lady, your thoughts

595
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,240
are as fanciful

596
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,640
as your face is pretty.

597
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,440
With such a beautiful bride,

598
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,400
I should only be so happy,

599
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,920
how could I ever consider divorcing her?

600
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,840
I've never seen a bride who runs around

601
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,720
the courtyard before the wedding is over.

602
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,280
If you don't want to end up with

603
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,640
a broken leg or

604
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,840
a missing arm here at the Shen residence,

605
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,720
then you'll need to behave yourself.

606
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,320
My lord, you're right.

607
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,400
My lord,

608
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,600
since Her Highness had said so,

609
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,240
then I'll fulfill my responsibilities

610
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,440
as the Lady of the Shen residence

611
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,440
and take really good care

612
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,000
of you.

613
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,360
This is how you

614
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,800
want to seduce me?

615
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,480
Since you said you would take care of me,

616
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,360
then let me tell you three things.

617
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,760
First,

618
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
don't even dream about

619
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,680
becoming the real Lady Shen.

620
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,600
It's only an act

621
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,400
between us.

622
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,240
Second,

623
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,680
don't expect to get any

624
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,040
information from me.

625
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,920
I know what Prime Minister Zhang

626
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,080
sent you here for.

627
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,880
Third,

628
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,360
you're not the wife

629
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,320
that I willingly chose.

630
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,360
Don't even think about surviving here.

631
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,280
Lord,

632
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,720
did you see Lady Shen?

633
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,680
And the wedding ceremony...

634
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,960
Just think of it as if it's done.

635
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,280
Then,

636
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,760
about the West Chamber...

637
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,520
Let her stay there.

638
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,560
[Chief Shen.]

639
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,000
Chief Shen.

640
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,600
There was a fire at Ming Hall.

641
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,760
Chief Shen.

642
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,160
How did the fire start?

643
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,400
Someone burned himself

644
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,560
and started the fire.

645
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,120
The one who started it

646
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,280
has been burned beyond recognition.

647
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
Deploy more guards right away

648
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,920
to secure the palace.

649
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,080
Find out the identity of the suicide.

650
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,600
And don't miss anything.

651
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,280
Yes.

652
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,560
[Why can't I see her?]

653
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,960
[I work at the Ministry of Justice.]

654
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,280
[I went in there]

655
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,120
[with your Lady]

656
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,160
[only yesterday.]

657
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,280
[You really can't go in, lady.]

658
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,880
[Without the butler's permission,]

659
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,480
[Please.]

660
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,640
[we really can't let you in.]

661
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,360
[Yeah.]

662
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,760
Chuichui.

663
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,520
You can't go in.

664
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,240
Xing,

665
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,960
something happened!

666
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,160
-Madame.
-Madame.

667
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,640
A pair of bodies were found

668
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,160
near the bamboo grove of Ximing Temple

669
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,960
and their condition is very suspicious.

10670
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,120
The Ministry of Justice and Inspectors

671
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,280
have already sent people there.

672
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,800
Let's go.

673
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,400
Let's go.
