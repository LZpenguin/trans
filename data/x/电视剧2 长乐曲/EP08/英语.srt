3
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,280
The more fiercely you fight,

4
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,000
the more peaceful I feel.

5
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
[Where are you going?]

6
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,640
[Jia is sick]

7
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,200
[and wants his father there with him.]

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,280
Let go!

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
You always use

10
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,320
Jia as an excuse.

11
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,360
Do you think I can't tell?

12
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,000
I won't allow you

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to go to your mistress!

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,360
You shrew!

15
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,999
Jealous shrew!

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
[You live off me and]

17
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,240
[still have the nerve to be rude to me?]

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
[Stop!]

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
[Get lost.]

20
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,840
What are you doing?

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
[That's Lady Shen.]

22
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
You shrew,

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,720
this isn't over.

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,600
Move!

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,720
Go away now.

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Go back to your business.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,120
What are you doing here?

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,040
Are you here only to laugh at me?

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,320
I...

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
How could I?

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,200
You married well

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,960
so you came here to flaunt it in my face?

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,080
I don't need your pity!

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Go away.

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,480
[Yan Xing, clerk of Ministry of Justice.]

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,280
[Your Majesty,]

38
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
Lady Shen is here.

39
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,440
Greetings to Your Majesty.

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,240
Get up.

41
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,720
[Lady Shen, you've made great
contributions to the Buddha case.]

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
I really want to give you a reward.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
But I couldn't

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,960
[come up with anything.]

45
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
So tell me yourself,

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,600
what reward do you want?

47
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
I don't want a reward.

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,640
[However, I humbly]

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,040
request a favor from Your Majesty.

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Sure.

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,440
Let me hear it.

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,960
I wish for Your Majesty

54
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,200
to address me as Clerk Yan

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
instead of Lady Shen.

56
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
You are very young and

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,040
already have such insight and ambition.

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,000
That's a good thing.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,680
My court values talent and ability,

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
regardless of gender.

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,159
This way, women, naturally,

62
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,560
can forge their own path

63
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,479
through their own skills,

64
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,920
without relying on their husbands.

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,240
I'll allow it.

66
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
If I might speak frankly,

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
although there are female clerks in

69
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,680
all the six ministries, most of them

70
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
are confined to cleaning and organizing.

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
For instance, at the Ministry of Justice,

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,120
the female clerks aren't allowed to conduct

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
investigations with the male clerks.

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
Look,

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,760
I am a woman as well.

76
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
[I am well aware of]

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
[the hardships]

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,120
[a woman must endure]

79
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
to be seen as equal to a man.

80
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
If I can

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,640
sit in this position,

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
then a female official

83
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,240
can surely conduct investigations.

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,200
[Lady Xu,]

85
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
write up a decree for me:

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
From now on,

87
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,640
female officials in all six ministries

88
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
will have the same rights

89
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,360
as male officials.

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,840
Her Highness is truly wise.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,200
Clerk Yan,

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,440
from now on,

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,800
you'll

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
have the freedom to investigate cases

95
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,080
just like your male peers.

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
Thank you, your majesty.

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
[Xing.]

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,840
Xiangren.

99
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,960
Is the Chief Clerk here?

100
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
The Chief Clerk isn't well these days,

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
he's on leave at home.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
Is there anything urgent?

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,800
It's nothing urgent,

104
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,720
just very shocking.

105
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you mean?

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,360
Regarding the

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,680
chronic poisoning of Liang Chenzhong,

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,480
Didn't you ask me to investigate the source

109
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
of the Guanyin poison from those near him?

110
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,200
I followed up on it.

111
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,000
Guess who did I chase it to?

112
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
It led me to Rong Zhui,

113
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,800
the owner of Tongming Pavilion.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Stop!

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
Stop resisting.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
Toxic plant Guanyin?

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,960
Take her away.

118
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,880
Move.

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,040
[I brought some supplements for your mom,]

120
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,480
there's some for you as well.

121
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,160
Looks like you've had a rough time in jail

122
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,920
and lost quite a bit of weight.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Your support is much appreciated, Shen Du.

124
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,960
I didn't

125
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,440
have a tough time with the prison guards.

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,680
[And it was quiet in the prison,]

127
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,560
giving me time to come up with

128
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
many ideas for improving siege equipment.

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,200
I know

130
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,520
it was foolish of me to turn myself in.

131
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,360
But my mother has been through so much,

132
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,280
[I could not allow her]

133
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
[to endure any more suffering.]

134
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,720
I really need to thank you

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,680
for finding out the truth

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,640
and clearing my family's name.

137
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,600
The Buddha's case may be closed,

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
but we still haven't found who was behind

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,120
the toxic plant Guanyin poisoning.

140
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,480
Your family's name

141
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,320
is not cleared yet.

142
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,640
So...

143
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
So you'll still arrest my mother?

144
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,560
[Why are you arresting me?]

145
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,160
[Take him away.]

146
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,880
[Chief Shen,]

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,680
Xu Xiangren and Lady Shen

148
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,080
arrested Liang Jiren.

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,240
They went to Tongming Pavilion?

150
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

151
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,200
Before that,

152
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,200
they already arrested the owner of

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
Tongming Pavilion, Rong Zhui.

154
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,000
They are fast.

155
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,560
Should I bring some men

156
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,080
and stop them?

157
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,200
Why?

158
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,400
She's just been granted authority to

159
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,560
investigate, let her show off for a bit.

160
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,239
Yes, Sir.

161
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,480
Lord Liang,

162
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,840
[recently,]

163
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,080
I have frequently visited your family.

164
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Besides Her Highness's task on me,

165
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,760
I also had my own agendas.

166
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,760
But now,

167
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
everything has been clarified.

168
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,440
And the culprits

169
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
have been captured by someone else.

170
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,480
Like the saying goes, the Emperor's 9 sons

171
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,040
are each different.

172
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
The toxic plant Guanyin poisoning has

173
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,160
nothing to do with you and your mother.

174
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
The second branch of the Liang family has

175
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
nothing to do with what the first branch did.

176
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,960
Focus on your own business.

177
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,360
Don't let

178
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,440
Her Highness's expectations down.

179
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,520
It was you who poisoned Liang Chenzhong

180
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,040
with the toxic plant Guanyin?

181
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,240
That's right.

182
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,680
It was me.

183
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,960
His eldest son

184
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,600
is nothing but a scoundrel.

185
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
If he died,

186
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,200
sooner or later,

187
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,680
he would have killed his father.

188
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,680
Besides, I am already

189
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,840
carrying his father's child.

190
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,840
Of course I had to think about the future.

191
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,440
[My lord,]

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
this way please.

193
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,680
There are some new dancers.

194
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,440
Would you like me to call them over

195
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
for you to pick?

196
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,200
Great.

197
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,440
Bravo!

198
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,360
Lord Liang,

199
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,240
I have a new beauty

200
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,720
for you.

201
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,880
Lan,

202
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
come over.

203
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,880
[Beautiful!]

204
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,640
-Come here.
-My lord.

205
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,280
Lord Liang,

206
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
please have some tea.

207
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,680
[I had no other choice.]

208
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,240
That scoundrel

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,200
either gambled

210
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,200
or wasted money in pleasure houses.

211
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,000
[When he's out of money,]

212
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,920
[he would come to me to threat]

213
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,680
for more.

214
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
He almost took everything we had.

215
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,720
[Otherwise,]

216
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,080
[I wouldn't have been forced to do this.]

217
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,120
Moreover,

218
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,760
I have

219
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,240
a child on the way.

220
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,200
Shouldn't I have to

221
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,880
think about him as well?

222
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,680
So,

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,960
because Rong Zhui was carrying his child,

224
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,280
he decided

225
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,120
to abandon his eldest son

226
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,360
heartlessly.

227
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,640
Yeah.

228
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,640
I have been a Delinquent for a long time

229
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,080
and have seen all kinds of cases.

230
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
But a father

231
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,640
deliberately poisoning his own son

232
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,280
is truly unheard of.

233
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,080
Who would have thought it.

234
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,120
A father would hurt his own son.

235
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,600
The human

236
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,160
is truly the most mysterious thing.

237
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
Chief Shen.

238
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,560
why are you here?

239
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,800
Lord Liang, did you forget?

240
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
The Buddha case

241
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
was entrusted entirely to me

242
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
by Her Highness.

243
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,280
[You, on the other hand, have truly]

244
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,480
shocked me with your ruthless method.

245
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
If I had any other choice,

246
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,200
I wouldn't have resorted to this.

247
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
I really had no choice.

248
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,960
They say even beasts look after their young.

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
How come with you,

250
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,840
you simply brushed it off with

251
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,760
'I had no choice'.

252
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,200
Chief Shen,

253
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,600
there's no need to mock me.

254
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,240
I did try to murder my son.

255
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,720
But you,

256
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
have turned in your father.

257
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,040
[We are essentially the same, aren't we?]

258
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,440
Back then, among the various crimes

259
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
my father was charged with,

260
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,600
one was the theft

261
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,520
of a weapon schematic

262
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,720
and leaking it to an enemy nation.

263
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,000
That schematic was drawn

264
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,240
by none other than your brother.

265
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,960
I was wondering

266
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
why you were always

267
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,520
hanging out with my foolish nephew.

268
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,600
I thought it was out of mutual respect,

269
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,120
that you were truly

270
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
close friends.

271
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,760
Turns out,

272
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,840
it was because you suspected our family.

273
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,200
My lady,

274
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,240
why did you come?

275
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,640
What are you doing here at this hour?

276
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm here to see you.

277
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,440
[Did anyone see you?]

278
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,720
[I don't know.]

279
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,640
We'll get into big trouble if anyone sees us.

280
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,360
[That's the least of our concerns now.]

281
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,080
Your son

282
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,040
must have known something.

283
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
That's why you wanted to kill him,

284
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,160
to silence him.

285
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,960
Chief Shen,

286
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
if you had discovered anything,

287
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,440
you probably

288
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,680
wouldn't be here asking me.

289
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
If this matter

290
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,120
reaches Her Highness,

291
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,960
I

292
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,360
will claim to know nothing.

293
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,400
So that means,

294
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,560
your concern

295
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,040
for your unborn child

296
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,640
must be fake.

297
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,320
If,

298
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,920
you promise me

299
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,280
to look after my unborn son in the future,

300
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,240
I am willing to recall what happened.

301
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,080
Perhaps,

302
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,840
I can remember something.

303
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,440
You are in no position

304
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
to negotiate with me.

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Have you ever heard of the 'Cui Zhe'

306
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,400
used by the Imperial Guard(IG)?

307
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,800
Each cut

308
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,320
draws exactly

309
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,880
36 drops of blood.

310
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,520
Over three days,

311
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,000
the convict is cut 360 times

312
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,440
without dying.

313
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
Shen Du,

314
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,560
I'm a court official.

315
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,439
I was involved in an attempted filicide.

316
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,760
But,

317
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,439
but I was an accomplice.

318
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
I don't merit a death sentence.

319
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,640
You.

320
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,240
Don't... Don't be reckless.

321
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,199
Reckless?

322
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,120
Lord Liang,

323
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,360
why do you think

324
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,680
they call me the White Death then?

325
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,840
Once you are in the IG,

326
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,560
don't expect to walk out of here alive.

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,800
You...

328
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,880
How, how dare you?

329
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,200
This is the first cut.

330
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,920
I have no other plans these days.

331
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,800
I'll just keep you company for three days.

332
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,720
I'll tell you.

333
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,880
I'll tell you.

334
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
I was drunk, and accidentally

335
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,280
leaked my brother's weapon schematic.

336
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,280
[Afterward,]

337
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,920
[I was too afraid to admit it.]

338
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,920
Your father and my brother

339
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,480
were very close at that time.

340
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,000
[Moreover,]

341
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,880
[he was already convicted of treason.]

342
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,920
So I just went with the flow

343
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,360
and placed the blame on him.

344
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,080
Chenzhong learned about this

345
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,440
by chance and

346
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,360
[has since been extorting me for money.]

347
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,640
I couldn't take it anymore.

348
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,280
I couldn't take it anymore!

349
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,840
[Chief Shen,]

350
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,480
[your father]

351
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,400
was already found guilty of treason.

352
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
[With concrete evidence,]

353
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,880
[even without this charge,]

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,120
his conviction would still stand.

355
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,320
It was really you.

356
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,040
[Then I'll overturn the convictions]

357
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,560
[one by one.]

358
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,720
[I do not seek fame in history but]

359
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,160
only wish to be true to my conscience

360
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,240
and to the people.

361
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,880
I won't align myself with your corrupt ways.

362
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,560
Absolutely not.

363
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
[Don't blame me for not warning you.]

364
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,080
Upright trees are cut down first,

365
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,920
Clean wells are drained first.

366
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,640
Should you refuse to ally with me,

367
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,680
you would meet your end.

368
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,960
You wouldn't stand a chance.

369
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,040
[As a servant of the emperor, it's my]

370
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,880
duty to address His Majesty's concerns.

371
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
I am prepared to face death in doing so.

372
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,440
[With the divine will of Heaven and time,]

373
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,200
[I command you:]

374
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,240
court official Shen Bingzhu had

375
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,920
[colluded with the enemy,]

376
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,400
[burnt our military supplies,]

377
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,120
[leaked weapon schematic,]

378
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,120
[colluded with foreign forces]

379
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,120
[and aided the enemy.]

380
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,320
[These crimes are punishable by death.]

381
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,480
[The male family members will be executed,]

382
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,640
[the women and children will be imprisoned.]

383
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
[This will be made known to all.]

384
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,320
Father,

385
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,200
all these years,

386
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,280
I've never given up on seeking justice for

387
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,720
the many lives lost in the Shen family.

388
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,840
But who was that woman?

389
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,120
I have never had a clue.

390
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,120
Was she friend or foe?

391
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,600
No matter what,

392
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,280
today,

393
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,200
I can at least prove that

394
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,880
you were framed for the weapon schematic,

395
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,680
Father, rest assured.

396
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,680
I will find that woman

397
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,960
someday.

398
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,480
I will find

399
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,520
the remaining evidence

400
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,480
piece by piece.

401
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,360
[Chief Shen.]

402
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,640
Chief Shen.

403
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,200
The celebration banquet of the Delinquents

404
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,080
and the Ministry of Justice is tonight.

405
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,040
What's it to do with me?

406
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,240
My lord,

407
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,240
you are right!

408
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,080
[Here, here, here.]

409
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,720
[Here. Good work!]

410
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,960
[Finish this one.]

411
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,840
[I'll pour you another one.]

412
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,040
[Let's get hammered!]

413
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,880
Can you drink or not?

414
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,800
Let's go over there.

415
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,880
Let's go.

416
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Here, Meng,

417
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
I'll drink to you.

418
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,520
Let's eat.

419
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,600
Good work!

420
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,400
Here, drink.

421
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
I almost forgot.

422
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,440
Your letter.

423
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,880
It was sent to the Ministry of Justice.

424
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,240
What made you so happy?

425
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,680
Chichi is coming to Xiang'an.

426
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,960
She wants to see me.

427
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
That's great!

428
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,920
I've heard you talking about

429
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,800
this Chichi

430
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
so many times.

431
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,600
Back then the Ministry of Justice received

432
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,720
so many self-recommendation letters.

433
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
Only you were foolish enough

434
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,840
to read each one carefully.

435
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,800
I even made fun of you.

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,720
Who would've thought that

437
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
you'd actually find such a reliable friend.

438
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,840
I envy you so much!

439
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,400
I still remember

440
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,040
the first letter

441
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
she sent from Jiangnan,

442
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,280
with golden floral decorations,

443
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,760
a delightful fragrance

444
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
and even flower petals inside the envelope.

445
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm so envious!

446
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,680
I'd really like to meet

447
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,680
such a talented

448
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,080
young woman.

449
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,520
She must be very beautiful.

450
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,360
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,920
She only asked to see me.

452
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm so angry.

453
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,440
They can really drink.

454
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,600
Let's eat then. Let's have some grapes.

455
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,640
Here.

456
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,760
Xing,

457
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,040
here.

458
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,440
I really admire

459
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,600
your investigative skills.

460
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,840
[This drink]

461
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,760
is to you.

462
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
Xiangren,

463
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,280
I don't really drink.

464
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,240
[That's no problem.]

465
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,120
[You'll learn.]

466
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,840
You'll slowly understand

467
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,360
the mysteries of wine.

468
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,200
Here.

469
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
I advise you to behave yourself.

470
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,160
Do you want to be caught again?

471
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,240
Chief Shen.

472
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,560
Shen Du,

473
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,160
why are you here?

474
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,880
Chief Shen,

475
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,120
have a seat.

476
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,480
Did I say I wouldn't come?

477
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,760
Chief Shen.

478
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
Chief Shen,

479
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,240
what an honor

480
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,600
having you here.

481
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,520
Here's to you.

482
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,080
Here, here.

483
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,360
[Here, Chief Shen,]

484
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,760
[I'll drink to you.]

485
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,600
Who would've thought,

486
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,120
Chief Shen can really drink.

487
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,840
Chief Shen,

488
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,600
I'll drink to you.

489
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,080
Here.

490
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,200
What kind of 'can really drink' is this?

491
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm not drunk.

492
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,360
I'm very fine.

493
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,840
Sure, sure, sure.

494
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
You're very fine. You're very fine.

495
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,120
If you don't believe me,

496
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,640
get someone to fight me.

497
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,760
Well,

498
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,800
I do have someone in mind

499
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,840
who could use a good beating.

500
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,160
Let's go.

501
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,880
Farewell to Chief Shen.

502
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,440
Be careful.

503
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,120
Jinglin,

504
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,920
the light.

505
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,960
What light?

506
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Who would carry a lantern

507
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
to beat someone up?

508
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,480
Let's go.

509
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
Beat someone up?

510
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,680
Yes.

511
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,960
But we can't do without the light.

512
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
Of course we can.

513
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,880
Look at me.

514
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,320
I'll be your light.

515
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,360
Let's go, let's go.

516
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,720
Jinglin, let's go.

517
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,400
Let's go.

518
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,520
Let's go, let's go.

519
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,440
Let's go.

520
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,560
C'mon.

521
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,000
Be careful.

522
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,280
Xing, take care!

523
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,520
Farewell to Chief Shen.

524
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,280
Be careful.

525
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,760
-Be careful.
-Chuichui,

526
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
let's go. Let's go drink some more.

527
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,880
[Who wants to drink with you?]

528
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,760
[I want to eat.]

529
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,160
Be careful.

530
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,520
Jinglin,

531
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,560
come hold

532
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,600
Chief Shen.

533
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,120
He's too heavy.

534
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,880
Let's go.

535
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,440
Chief Shen, watch the stairs.

536
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:32,800
Slow down.

537
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,720
Another stair.

538
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,000
And up, and up, and up.

539
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,960
Stand still.

540
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,960
Be careful.

541
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,280
[Who's there?]

542
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,200
[Come out!]

543
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,040
Who's there?

544
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,280
Who's there?

545
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,320
Wait for me here.

546
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,280
I'm going to beat him up.

547
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,800
I'll go.

548
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,320
Fine, fine, fine.

549
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,680
You go, you go.

550
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,520
[Who's there? Who are you?]

551
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,280
[Come out!]

552
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,560
He's really drunk.

553
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,880
[Who's there?]

554
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,280
[Who?]

555
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,320
What do you want?

556
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,880
[Only those who were unfaithful]

557
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,360
[were killed in the Buddha’s case.]

558
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,960
That many disloyal men and women

559
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,560
were buried at Ximing Temple.

560
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,720
[Yet you still dare to lust after mistress]

561
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,960
and neglect your wife and children?

562
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,440
[This]

563
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,920
is only a warning.

564
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,960
If there's a next time,

565
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,360
I'll take out your heart

566
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,280
and bury it in the ground!

567
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,040
[I' won't do it again.]

568
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,480
I' will never do it again.

569
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,640
[There won't be a next time.]

570
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,160
So this is what the White death

571
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,640
is like drunk.

572
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,480
Take your 'sober' Chief

573
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,200
back to the residence.

574
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,840
Let's go.

575
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,680
Be careful. Let's go.

576
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,760
Be careful.

577
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,920
Who was it?

578
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,040
Who was this ruthless?

579
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,800
Who was it?

580
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,560
Who knew the mighty White Death

581
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,680
can't hold his liquor.

582
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,120
What happened to all your usual prowess?

583
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,560
It would be easier

584
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,440
to carry a body than you.

585
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,440
Thank you.

586
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,440
You're welcome.

587
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,680
[It's nothing to]

588
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,480
bring back home my drunk roommate.

589
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,440
No need to thank me.

590
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,560
The Detention Center.

591
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,480
So you knew.

592
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,920
I thought you didn't remember anymore.

593
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,520
Are you okay?

594
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,400
This is from

595
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,279
a newly opened candied fruits store.

596
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
[Who's there?]

597
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,719
I should go now.

598
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,480
[I'll bring back a comb tomorrow.]

599
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,960
[This is really good.]

600
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
[Try some.]

601
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,040
Let her go.

602
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,680
-Let go!
-Let her go!

603
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,000
[-Let her go!]
[-Du!]

604
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,800
Let her go!

605
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,840
I will find a way

606
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,960
to get you out!

607
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,040
Wait for me!

608
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,360
[Lady Xu,]

609
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,240
thank you.

610
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,400
Shen Du!

611
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,560
Shen Du,

612
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,800
you annoying little devil!

613
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,000
[Morning, my lady.]

614
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,480
[Morning, my lady.]

615
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,520
[My lady, breakfast is served.]

616
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,160
You...

617
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,320
Morning.

618
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,600
[I misbehaved last night after drinking.]

619
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,560
No problem.

620
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,600
Last night...

621
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,920
It's okay.

622
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,400
[Xing!]

623
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,720
Xing!

624
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,880
Qi Yeyun?

625
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,440
Xing,

626
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,000
what happened to your forehead?

627
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Who hurt you?

628
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,720
Was it you?

629
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,040
Did you hit my sister?

630
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,160
No, he didn't.

631
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,640
I had a bit too much to drink last night

632
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,800
and bumped my head.

633
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,160
By the way,

634
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,240
what are you here for?

635
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,240
I'm here to bring something to you

636
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,200
for my lady.

637
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,920
Your lady?

638
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,600
Yeah, Lu Chuichui.

639
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,960
This is the Hundred Flowers Essence

640
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,760
she has treasured for many years.

641
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,240
Brew it in water.

642
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,440
It can help with the hangover headache.

643
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,600
She specifically asked me to bring it.

644
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,320
Chuichui is so thoughtful.

645
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,000
But when did you join the Lu family?

646
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,960
The last clerk at the Lu's Pawnshop

647
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,640
was fired for talking too much.

648
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,320
So now I'm their new clerk.

649
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,400
I thought,

650
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,440
since you don't want to take me

651
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,480
as your apprentice yet,

652
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,320
and I'm too young to apply

653
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,960
for a position in the Ministry of Justice,

654
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,240
working as a clerk at your friend's

655
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,040
family shop

656
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,360
allows me to be closer to you.

657
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,240
If you keep talking so much,

658
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,720
I think you are about to

659
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,360
follow the last clerk's suit.

660
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,520
How could that be?

661
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,040
I only talk this much

662
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,840
in front of my sister.

663
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,200
Zhong,

664
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,480
so you just let anyone in now.

665
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,000
Who let this

666
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,400
boy in?

667
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,760
[First of June.]

668
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,440
[The Hu cake was too hard at breakfast,]

669
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,560
[Du was furious.]

670
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,360
[Second of June.]

671
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,120
[Dinner was pagoda tree leaf cold salad,]

672
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,560
[Du had three serves.]

673
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,880
[Third of June.]

674
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,080
[The douhua was too salty at breakfast,]

675
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,280
[Du was furious.]

676
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,560
[Fourth of June.]

677
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,400
[There was no more candied fruits,]

678
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,480
[Du was furious.]

679
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,640
Xing,

680
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,280
do you

681
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,480
take me as a three year old?

682
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,040
My lord.

683
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,400
Is everything at Yingzhou taken care of?

684
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,360
Yes, my lord.

685
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,960
They also sent their accounts.

686
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,360
[This year's revenue is nearly 30.000.]

687
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,240
Keep this a secret.

688
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,440
Be sure not to mention this

689
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,080
even to Prince Xian.

690
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,280
My lord, rest assured.

691
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,040
This matter

692
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
will remain completely confidential.

693
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,480
[Moreover,]

694
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,120
[I've also]

695
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,000
[taken care of the families]

696
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,480
[who support the Emperor.]

697
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,920
Now that they've been compensated,

698
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,760
they will surely

699
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,280
keep their mouths shut.

700
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,640
Nothing will go wrong.

701
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,160
Liang Jiren

702
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,320
tends to talk too much.

703
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,760
Her Highness

704
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
might secretly exile him this time.

705
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,680
Find a chance

706
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,920
to shut him up for good.

707
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,240
He knows too much.

708
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,120
[Cheng Cai.]

709
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,760
[Here.]

710
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,560
[Zhang Xinliang.]

711
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,200
[Here.]

712
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,960
[Song...]

713
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,920
Isn't this Lady Shen?

714
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,280
[What happened?]

715
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,120
Lady Shen

716
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,560
has come personally to report.

717
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,120
Yan Xing.

718
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,720
Here.

719
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,360
How did you

720
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,480
get all these injuries?

721
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,920
I accidentally fell.
