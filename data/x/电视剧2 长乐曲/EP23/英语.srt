3
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,040
Chi?

4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,440
What brings you here?

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
The new scribe, Lady Yan.

6
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
It's been a while.

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
This is a crime scene.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,800
How could you allow

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
unrelated individuals to enter?

10
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,000
You've misunderstood, Lord Shen.

11
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,440
This gentleman

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,800
is the top detective in the realm.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Mr. Pan Chi.

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,960
He's here to assist me

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,000
with the investigation,

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
not an unrelated individual.

17
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
Greetings, Lord Shen.

18
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,720
So,

19
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
it seems the rumors are true.

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,160
Chi is indeed Pan Chi.

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,400
You can always

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,560
think of me

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,000
as just Chi.

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,840
I happened to come across this case.

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,360
At the request of the suspect's

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
brother-in-law, I came to investigate.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
When the suspect was apprehended,

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
he was found unarmed

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
without any trace of weapons.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
I suspect

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,800
he might have been wronged.

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,280
The case file indicates

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,320
the victim's brother

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,440
doesn't practice martial arts at all,

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,000
making him an unlikely suspect.

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,760
Given the situation at the victim's home,

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
it seems likely to be a revenge killing.

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,640
[The victim had quite a temper.]

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,080
[He often got into arguments with neighbors]

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,400
[over land disputes.]

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,840
[He's even been in fights before, causing]

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,200
[trouble at the village chief's place.]

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,640
[In his business dealings,]

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,880
[he often clashed with others,]

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,200
[making quite a few enemies.]

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
It's possible that the murderer

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,120
seized this opportunity to kill him,

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,920
and then frame the victim's brother.

49
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,840
If this is indeed a revenge killing,

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,920
the murderer must have harbored

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,560
deep-seated hatred for the victim.

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,600
Killing alone would be one thing,

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,640
but why took

54
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,320
the victim's head?

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,240
What's the motive behind that?

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,720
Setting aside the motive for now,

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
can you two figure out

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,920
what weapon was used?

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,440
Ease your mind, Lord Mo,

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,920
let us examine the corpse thoroughly.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,240
Let's wrap things up for today.

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm famished.

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,280
Lord Mo, I shall now depart.

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,880
Farewell.

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,320
You said we should investigate first.

66
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,640
Why are you suddenly hungry?

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,600
Besides,

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,520
we're not in Xiang'an right now,

69
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,320
how can you...

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,920
I can't help it; I'm starving.

71
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,080
Didn't you mention

72
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,280
you'd prepare medicinal cuisine for me?

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,000
Where is it?

74
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,080
Make medicinal cuisine?

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,360
With these hands, seriously?

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680
What's the matter?

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,360
These hands just examined a corpse.

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,200
Are you really OK with eating food

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
prepared with these hands?

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,760
YES 路 I 路AM.

81
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
JUST 路 YOU 路 WAIT.

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,320
Now this is more like it.

83
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,200
Seeing that he didn't even

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,120
prepare a welcoming feast,

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
I was concerned that

86
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
this stingy governor might also

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
skimp on our accommodations.

88
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,080
Jing Lin.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Watch your words!

90
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
Lord Mo's diligence in governance sets

91
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,600
him apart as an exceptional official

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
in the eyes of the populace.

93
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,720
A feast matters not.

94
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,000
What truly matters is

95
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,520
being able to serve the citizens.

96
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,160
I checked;

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,560
the kitchen here is quite decent.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,760
As soon as my lady returned,

99
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,000
she went cooking for you.

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,720
Help me with this!

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,400
Lad?

102
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,720
Why are you here?

103
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,240
Where's your mast...

104
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,960
Where's your sis?

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,480
As soon as she came back,

106
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,120
I pestered her to teach me her skills.

107
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,360
She gladly agreed.

108
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,880
In the end, she took me to the kitchen,

109
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,240
showed me how to make medicinal cuisine,

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,560
and then hurried off

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
to meet her "soulmate."

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,960
I was left in the kitchen for four hours.

113
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Soulmate?

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,320
"Youths of Yingzhou tire of the plains,"

115
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,320
"in fox fur coats, they hunt by the walls."

116
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,200
[The password is correct,]

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,960
[but why is it a male voice?]

118
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,880
[Wait,]

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,000
[this voice sounds familiar.]

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
[Why...]

121
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
[is it you?]

122
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,480
"Youths of Ying tire of the plains,"

123
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,640
"in fox fur coats, they hunt by the walls."

124
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,560
"Many cups of nomad wine leaves them sober,"

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
"at ten, the nomad kids are adept horsemen."

126
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,160
I, Chi,

127
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,920
humbly greet you, Lady Yan.

128
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,480
Chi?

129
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,240
Chi...

130
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,160
you're evidently a gentleman;

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,800
why did you trick me into thinking

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
you were a girl from Jiangnan?

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
Honestly, I didn't mean to deceive you.

134
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,040
It's just that when you

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,200
replied to my first letter,

136
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,520
you started to refer to me as a fair lady.

137
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,720
I...

138
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,320
Well, why did you use

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,440
a floral paper for ladies?

140
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,240
It was filled with a pleasant aroma

141
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480
and had flower petals mixed in.

142
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
My dear, you

143
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,160
promised to write lyrics for my new song,

144
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
but it's been over a month now.

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,280
When will you get around to it?

146
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,600
Sure, sure...

147
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,920
Deliver it to the Ministry of Justice.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,840
Thanks.

149
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,000
My lord,

150
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,920
following our recent public appeal

151
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,640
for leads on difficult cases,

152
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,120
these are the replies

153
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,680
we received.

154
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,600
I've organized the letters

155
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
by region.

156
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
The one on top is...

157
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Throw them away.

158
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,400
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

159
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,040
Throw them away.

160
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,840
If you're really bored,

161
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,880
go clean the floor.

162
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
"Thoughts on Difficult Cases?"

10163
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,320
I thought

164
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,280
it was some damsel form Jiangnan who

165
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,560
also enjoys investigating and analyzing,

166
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
which was why I sent my first reply.

167
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,840
This "Chi" was

168
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,600
actually a name I randomly came up with.

169
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,160
The flower

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
was borrowed from someone else.

171
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
So I actually made a mistake.

172
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,920
Why didn't you correct me

173
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,040
in your later replies?

174
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,920
Actually, I was thinking,

175
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,520
since we exchange letters,

176
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,240
it doesn't matter whether I'm a young lord

177
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,480
or a fair lady. It doesn't affect

178
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,480
our friendship through letters,

179
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
to converse about the world,

180
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,400
and to delve into our cases together,

181
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,160
right?

182
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,160
That's true.

183
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,640
Now that you mention it,

184
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,720
it feels much more enjoyable.

185
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,840
By the way,

186
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,760
I didn't know what you liked, so

187
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,280
I specially sought out the only copy of

188
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,880
"Strange Weaponry from the Western Regions"

189
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
This book

190
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
documents unique tools and techniques

191
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
from the Western Regions.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Take a look.

193
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,880
See if you like it.

194
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,760
Thank you!

195
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,720
I love it!

196
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,920
Hold on,

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,840
It's this page.

198
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Take a close look at this

199
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,080
curved blade on this page.

200
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,000
After you left today,

201
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,520
I went to check the corpse again.

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
The wound on the headless corpse,

203
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
given its angle and smoothness,

204
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
suggests that it was not

205
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
caused by a straight blade,

206
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
but rather by a curved one.

207
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,560
[So based on my judgment,]

208
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,040
[the murder weapon should be a special]

209
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,960
curved blade that cuts through iron

210
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,760
as easily as it cuts through air.

211
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,440
I've seen this type of curved blade

212
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,280
at the border of Xichen.

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,640
The one on this page,

214
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,560
the edge

215
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,880
shows slight differences from

216
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,160
the wound on the victim's neck.

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,680
The structure is nearly identical,

218
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,520
so whether this is the one

219
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,320
still requires further investigation.

220
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,040
A curved blade from the Western Regions?

221
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,560
No wonder I've been racking my brains

222
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,360
all day and still couldn't figure out

223
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,600
what the murder weapon was.

224
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,880
It turns out to be a weapon

225
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,440
I've never encountered before.

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,840
Looks like I really need to

227
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,680
study this book thoroughly

228
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,440
and learn more about exotic weapons.

229
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,520
Maybe I can even

230
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,480
find clues in here.

231
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
I came to Gannan this time

232
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,520
not only to investigate cases,

233
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
but also for something more important.

234
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,320
Greetings, Lord Commander.

235
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,720
Lord Mo is weary

236
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,560
and has retired

237
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,520
early tonight.

238
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,360
It'd be best if you also returned to rest.

239
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
Please convey to Lord Mo that

240
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,000
I will return another day for a chat.

241
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,400
Yes, my lord.

242
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
Please have a safe trip back.

243
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,320
Like a dream, a fairy, suddenly fading away;

244
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,400
where's the evening glow gone, leaving the screen empty?

245
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,880
So,

246
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,680
long before the incident in Xiang'an City,

247
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,760
the human traffickers in Gannan

248
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,000
already had the fire moth jade.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,720
That's right.

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
The Fire Moth Sect has

251
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
deeply infiltrated Gannan,

252
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,840
far beyond our imagination.

253
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,920
During my investigation,

254
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,520
I found that many locals

255
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
secretly worship the Fire Moth Sect.

256
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
From Xiang'an to Province Ying,

257
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,920
I always felt

258
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,680
that behind the Fire Moth Sect,

259
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,360
there is an invisible hand

260
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,680
setting up a grand scheme.

261
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
And the figure behind this scheme

262
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,280
must be someone with immense power.

263
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Unknowingly,

264
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
we've been chatting for so long.

265
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,520
It's late at night;

266
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
I should head back.

267
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Then we'll

268
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,320
talk again next time.

269
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,640
What about my gift?

270
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,600
You didn't forget to prepare it, did you?

271
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,200
I did prepare it,

272
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,520
but,

273
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
it's not quite suitable for you.

274
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,800
You probably won't like it.

275
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Next time,

276
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,320
I'll buy you

277
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,120
something else.

278
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,400
You didn't even show it to me.

279
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
How do you know if I like it or not?

280
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
You insist on seeing it yourself.

281
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
Alright,

282
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,560
now you saw it.

283
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
It doesn't suit you, right?

284
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
It's not right to take back a gift

285
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,040
after it's been offered.

286
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Besides,

287
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,240
I really like it.

288
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,600
I just happen to need one

289
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,200
hairpin...

290
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,360
So,

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,160
put it on for me.

292
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,040
How does it look?

293
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,480
Does it suit me?

294
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,920
[Why did the candle suddenly go out?]

295
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,000
[Is it...]

296
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,800
It looks good, quite good.

297
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,800
It's getting late.

298
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,880
I really should head back.

299
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,560
So long!

300
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,480
It's so late,

301
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,440
Are you planning to keep watch for me?

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Why are you still dawdling?

303
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,640
Come over and sleep.

304
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
[Forget it,]

305
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,320
[it's not like]

306
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,080
[we haven't slept in the same bed before.]

307
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
[If I catch a cold,]

308
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,960
[that would be self-inflicted suffering.]

309
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,720
Is that Pan Chi

310
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,040
really your type?

311
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,200
What do you mean by that?

312
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,280
Like conducting investigations?

313
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,440
I do have quite a good rapport with him.

314
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,160
Hey!

315
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,880
What are you doing?

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,920
If you keep this up,

317
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,120
I will go all out!

318
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,160
Going all out?

319
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,040
I'm curious to see

320
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,040
what that is like?

321
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,520
Shen Du,

322
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,840
why are you awake at this late hour,

323
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,479
acting all crazy?

324
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,920
Someone's beating the drum to seek justice.

325
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,520
Who was beating the drum at the gate,

326
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
and what grievance does he have?

327
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,360
In response to my lord,

328
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,640
my name is Du Fusheng,

329
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,600
a merchant of herbal medicine.

330
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,640
Today is

331
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,800
the wedding day of my youngest daughter,

332
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,880
Du Xiaowan and Li Hongfa's son,

333
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,040
Li Zimo.

334
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,720
Unexpectedly, a strange incident occurred.

335
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,800
My daughter

336
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,480
was present when she was welcomed in,

337
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,600
but after the wedding banquet, when they

338
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,560
were about to share the nuptial cup,

339
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
she suddenly went missing.

340
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
[The incident happened so abruptly.]

341
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
[Despite our search, she remained missing.]

342
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
[So we came to report to the authorities.]

343
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,560
On a joyous occasion with many guests,

344
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
this will be challenging to investigate.

345
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,200
Do you have a guest list?

346
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,600
Yes, yes,

347
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,840
it's right here.

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Bring it up.

349
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
Was the marriage between your two families

350
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
based on mutual consent?

351
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,320
Yes, my lord,

352
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,240
Xiaowan and I are well-matched,

353
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,200
and we cherish each other.

354
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,800
[This outcome took everyone by surprise.]

355
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,000
[I implore you, my lord,]

356
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
to find Xiaowan for me.

357
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,000
Dispatch teams

358
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,600
to both families for investigation.

359
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
Focus particularly on the Li family;

360
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,080
they require a meticulous examination.

361
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,080
Look for any

362
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,040
evidence that may have been overlooked.

363
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,480
Pay special attention to

364
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,920
the entries and exits of all doors.

365
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,840
Understood!

366
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Lord Mo,

367
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,160
the guest list's been thoroughly checked,

368
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,360
most guests are still present,

369
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
with only a few unaccounted for.

370
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,040
Locate them!

371
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,040
Bring everyone back once found.

372
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes!

373
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,480
What is it?

374
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,440
My lord,

375
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,040
if we all go out to search,

376
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,360
there may not be enough personnel

377
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,280
to investigate the scene.

378
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,040
Lord Mo,

379
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
if you lack manpower,

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,280
my guardsmen can assist.

381
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,880
Then I'll count on you, Lord Shen.

382
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,480
Jing Lin.

383
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
My lord.

384
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,040
Proceed.

385
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,240
Yes!

386
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,080
You all follow me.

387
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,480
You all come with me as well.

388
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,440
[Li Hongfa's family is affluent.]

389
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,920
[The wedding house must be]

390
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,400
[meticulously decorated.]

391
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,400
[There are no signs of]

392
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,520
[a struggle inside.]

393
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,560
It appears that something occurred in here.

394
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
In a fit of rage,

395
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,040
someone damaged this.

396
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,720
This is supposed to be a celebration,

397
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
yet everything here feels off.

398
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,920
Furthermore,

399
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
just looking at this door frame,

400
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,160
it's clearly been refurbished,

401
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,160
yet there are signs of peeling paint.

402
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
This definitely indicates a problem.

403
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,080
I share your thoughts on this.

404
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,520
By the way,

405
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,080
have you made any discoveries?

406
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
I passed through the living room,

407
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,240
and also went by the corner arbor

408
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,440
and the rockery,

409
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
but along the way,

410
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,880
I found nothing of note.

411
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,320
That makes sense.

412
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,240
The bride didn't leave of her own accord;

413
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,080
she was abducted by someone she knew,

414
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,360
taken out through the back window.

415
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,600
With such a pressing case at hand,

416
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,720
are you two still in the mood

417
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,680
to chat idly here?

418
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,880
I'm analyzing the case with Lady Yan.

419
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
How is that mere idle chatter?

420
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,080
Besides,

421
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
we've already reached a conclusion.

422
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,200
The bride

423
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,240
was indeed taken through this back window.

424
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,400
Alright.

425
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,480
Time for certain individuals to get to work.

426
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,800
Hurry and issue orders to search for her.

427
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,760
Very well,

428
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,840
Mr. Pan, please lead the way.

429
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
Along with my guardsmen

430
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,280
to pursue the suspects.

431
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,400
Why did you leave in the middle?

432
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,160
A servant of mine reported

433
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,360
that my child fell sick,

434
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,640
and my husband

435
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,280
is unable to care for the child.

436
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
It was already quite late.

437
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,000
I couldn't

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,760
keep this up until dawn, right?

439
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,040
My lord,

440
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
please,

441
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,840
don't mention this

442
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
to my wife.

443
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,680
I came here with the purpose

444
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,120
of checking on my mistress as well.

445
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,520
At the wedding,

446
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,120
did anything

447
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,680
unusual occur?

448
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,600
Nothing at all.

449
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,280
Except for that...

450
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,240
Xu Jize performed quite well.

451
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,000
I didn't notice anything else

452
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
out of the ordinary.

453
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,680
As for Xu Jize,

454
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,200
he certainly had a tough time.

455
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,520
Being a wedding attendant

456
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,920
is not an easy task.

457
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,720
There are very few in Yingzhou.

458
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,280
But I heard that

459
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,120
he has no recommendation.

460
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,280
He had no way to secure a public position,

461
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,080
so he became an wedding attendant.

462
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,280
Let's go, everyone.

463
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,480
Where's Xu Jize?

464
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,560
Why isn't he here?

465
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,960
My lord,

466
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,800
he hasn't been located.

467
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,800
You didn't find him?

468
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,280
In that case,

469
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,360
[Xu Jize]

470
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,160
[is the only one who left early]

471
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,600
[and had the opportunity]

472
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,920
[to get close to the bride.]

473
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,600
Lady Yan,

474
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,000
do you think

475
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,280
the culprit could be Xu Jize?

476
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,040
At this moment, I can't provide an answer

477
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,880
to that question.

478
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,080
Before the case is resolved,

479
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,800
everyone present

480
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,040
is a suspect.

481
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,600
His absence from the scene

482
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,800
only suggests that

483
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,480
his suspicion is even more pronounced.

484
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,600
At the end of the day,

485
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
we still need evidence and witnesses.

486
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,840
You are Lord Commander's wife indeed.

487
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,200
Though at a young age,

488
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,280
you speak and act with great precision,

489
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,920
and have your own set of principles.

490
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,480
From what you just said,

491
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,040
it's clear you know

492
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,840
my husband well.

493
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,360
Detain them in the governor's office.

494
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,440
My lord!

495
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,080
Let's go.

496
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,560
Please, don't kill me!

497
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,520
Don't kill me!

498
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Who are you?

499
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,200
Why are you fleeing at this hour?

500
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,960
My name is Xu Jize.

501
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,520
Please, don't kill me!

502
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,560
Over there...

503
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Someone died over there!

504
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,800
Xu Jize?

505
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
Are you that wedding attendant?

506
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,280
Hand him over to Lord Mo.

507
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,480
You are quite something, huh?

508
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,680
Pushed a civilian out to intercept a suspect?

509
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,520
Is this the style of the Imperial Guard?

510
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,080
The style of the Imperial Guard?

511
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,400
Is it a machine that kills many,

512
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,480
or a demon that stops children

513
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,280
from crying at night?

514
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
Which one does

515
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,480
Mr. Pan prefer?

516
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,280
Lord Commander, you are quite self-aware.

517
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,520
I admire that.

518
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,600
Really.

519
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,960
But since we're at this point,

520
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,080
let's speak frankly.

521
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,880
You constantly target me,

522
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,080
always pick on me.

523
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,040
If so,

524
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,120
why did you insist on dragging me

525
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,920
to pursue the culprit together?

526
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,840
Mr. Pan, you are also self-aware.

527
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,240
You know you're in my way.

528
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,120
Why do you keep showing up?

529
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,640
I'm doing this out of necessity

530
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,720
for the sake of solving the case.

531
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,840
Necessity?

532
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,680
Showing off even if I was at the scene.

533
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,840
Was that also out of necessity?

534
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,400
[Help!]

535
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,680
Why did it suddenly become quiet?

536
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,440
You,

537
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,720
go down there and take a look.

538
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,320
Why should I go down?

539
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,000
You, an honorable commander

540
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,760
are still here.

541
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,280
Who knows what was happening down there?

542
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,920
Besides,

543
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,400
if I go down

544
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,680
and get killed, what then?

545
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,400
If you die,

546
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,600
I will collect your body,

547
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
build a grave for you,

548
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,400
and ensure your spirit

549
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
doesn't wander about,

550
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
so as not to scare others.

551
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Why are you so sharp-tongued?

552
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,320
You're at a loss for words, aren't you?

553
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,640
Get your arse down there!

554
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,840
I'll assess the situation first.

555
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,480
You are?

556
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,440
Don't be afraid. I'm here to rescue you!

557
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,280
Lord Shen!

558
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,720
You are that bride from today's wedding?

559
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,880
Yes,

560
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,840
I am Du Xiaowan.

561
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,760
Save me, my lord!

562
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,000
There's another person down there,

563
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
another one!

564
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,080
At least you have a conscience.

565
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,920
I climbed up on my own.

566
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,000
My back!

567
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,680
You call yourself a commander,

568
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,280
yet you have no honor.

569
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,840
You keep stabbing me in the back!

570
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
I wasn't talking about you.

571
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,240
There's another one.

572
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,320
A dead man!

573
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,760
You all,

574
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,920
go secure the perimeter.

575
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,640
Jing Lin,

576
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,920
check if there's anything

577
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,880
unusual down there.

578
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,600
Understood!

579
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,800
Lord Shen,

580
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
there's nothing unusual down there.

581
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,000
[Lord Shen,]

582
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,040
[the perimeter has been secured.]

583
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,920
[Nothing is unusual.]

584
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,360
On our way here,

585
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
we all saw

586
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,600
the nervous-looking suspect

587
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,560
who is the wedding attendant.

588
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,280
Why do you keep investigating elsewhere?

589
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,560
Are you so sure

590
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,840
that he is not the murderer?

591
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,600
I can't be certain

592
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,000
if that man is the murderer or not,

593
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,600
but my intuition tells me

594
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
that this incident

595
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,520
is not as simple as

596
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,400
it appears.

597
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,400
I've truly broadened my horizons,

598
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,640
witnessing how the esteemed commander

599
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,680
solves cases with

600
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,120
his extraordinary intuition.

601
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,120
Lord Shen,

602
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,280
do you want to continue investigating?

603
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,040
Let's head back.

604
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,160
-Where is she?
-You bastard!

605
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,680
Give me back my daughter!

606
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,960
Where have you hidden her?

607
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,840
Where is Xiaowan?

608
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,920
Tell me!

609
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,840
Animal!

610
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,560
Hold your tongue

611
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,480
and behave in court!

612
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,560
Xu Jize,

613
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,920
Let me ask you,

614
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,160
regarding Lady Du's disappearance,

615
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,320
is it related to you?

616
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,120
I'm being wronged, my lord!

617
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,560
Her abduction

618
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,840
has nothing to do with me.

619
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,360
I was trying to rescue her!

620
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,880
Do you have any witnesses or evidence

621
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,960
to support this claim?

622
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,120
My lord,

623
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,760
the event unfolded abruptly,

624
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,560
and in my haste to rescue her,

625
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,240
there were no witnesses.

626
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
However, every word I speak is the truth.

627
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
I implore you to see the clarity.

628
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,560
So, there're no witnesses or evidence?

629
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,360
My lady,

630
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,480
Lord Shen has returned.

631
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,600
You're finally back!

632
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,680
Did you find anything?

633
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,720
The bride has been located,

634
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,000
and a corpse was brought back.

635
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,600
A fatality?

636
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,160
How are you doing?

637
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,280
Are you injured?

638
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,760
I am not someone

639
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,800
who can be easily harmed.

640
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,920
My lady, ease your mind.

641
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
Then what happened to you?

642
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,440
There are bruises all over your hands,

643
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,720
and you're covered in mud!

644
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,080
You should ask your

645
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,280
smart arse husband about this.

646
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,000
Along the way,

647
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,720
I did all the dirty and hard work,

648
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,400
and in the end, he took all the credit.

649
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,280
Anyway,

650
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,680
the fact that you both returned safely

651
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
is good enough.

652
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,800
By the way,

653
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,640
how did you bring back

654
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,960
the bride?

655
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,360
Tell me the details.

656
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,400
First, we encountered

657
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,720
a suspect

658
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,200
who was fleeing in panic.

659
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,280
Then we discovered

660
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,080
the bride trapped in a well.

661
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,360
In that well,

662
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,520
besides the bride,

663
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,160
there was also a corpse,

664
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,880
so we brought them both back.

665
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,240
The suspect you mentioned

666
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,320
is the Xu Jize who was brought back by

667
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,520
the guardsmen, right?

668
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,000
Exactly, the attendant from the wedding.

669
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,640
After you left,

670
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,160
I also investigated the guests

671
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,320
at the wedding.

672
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,280
According to them, Xu Jize

673
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,760
is quite a good person.

674
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,040
On the surface,

675
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,160
he doesn't seem to have a motive.

676
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,520
Whether he is the murderer or not

677
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,680
still needs to be investigated.

678
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,640
By the way,

679
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,760
when I was at the bottom of the well,

680
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,600
I remember seeing a sack.

681
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,880
That sack

682
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,000
was likely used

683
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
to abduct the bride.

684
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,120
Why didn't you mention

685
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,040
such crucial evidence earlier?

686
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,120
I'm not your subordinate.

687
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,360
Why should I

688
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,680
report everything to you?

689
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,920
Enough,

690
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,800
you both should go get changed.

691
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,480
I'll wait for you in the court.

692
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
This is a case for the Yingzhou magistrate,

693
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,680
and should be dealt by Lord Mo himself.

694
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,080
I won't be joining you.

695
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,319
[My lord, with no solid evidence]

696
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,440
[you can't arrest me.]

697
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,040
[I'm being wronged!]

698
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,600
[I risked my life...]

699
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,240
What's the status of the interrogation?

700
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,080
[...trying to save Lady Du!]

701
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,480
I missed some details earlier,

702
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,160
and now I'm completely at a loss.

703
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,000
And she wasn't harmed,

704
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,040
just sprained her ankle.

705
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,319
My lord,

706
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,880
shouldn't you

707
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,680
change your attitude towards me?

708
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,600
This guy really knows how

709
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,040
to flatter himself.

710
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,880
Before any evidence is presented,

711
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,600
he distances himself from everything.

712
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,680
And he requests to be treated nicely.

713
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,480
I've truly never encountered

714
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,839
such an arrogant individual.

715
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,759
If a tree has no bark,

716
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,279
it will surely perish.

717
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,760
A person without shame

718
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,400
is unimaginable!

719
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,080
You won't admit it until

720
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,760
you're presented with the evidence, right?

721
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,160
Lord Mo,

722
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,920
I have new evidence to present.

723
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,760
Xu Jize,

724
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,080
do you recognize this?

725
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,320
Does this look familiar to you?

726
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,240
This item has nothing to do with me.

727
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,640
it must belong to the murderer.

728
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,760
It's that dead person

729
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,800
who abducted Lady Du.

730
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,200
I was just trying to save her!

731
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,760
Don't wrong the innocent!

732
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,240
Then tell me in detail

733
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,480
what you saw.

734
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,600
I...

735
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,440
I just went to the restroom,

736
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,120
and when I came out,

737
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,160
I saw the culprit

738
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,600
abducting Lady Du.

739
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,480
[The incident happened so suddenly.]

740
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,400
[I didn't have time]

741
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
[to notify anyone else.]

742
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,400
[Worried about her life,]

743
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,560
I went alone to rescue her.

744
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,200
How can you expect anyone to believe

745
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,120
such baseless claims?

746
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,400
For God's sake,

747
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,880
everything I said is true.

748
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,760
I urge you all to see clearly!

749
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,760
Let me clarify for you.

750
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,560
You and the deceased are accomplices.

751
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,960
Together, you abducted Lady Du,

752
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,360
and then, due to a falling out,

753
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,280
you killed your accomplice.

754
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,960
To cover up your tracks,

755
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,240
you pretended to be a good person,

756
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,560
washing your hands

757
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,360
of all responsibility.

758
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,360
My lord,

759
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,240
I'm being wronged!

760
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,600
I truly didn't kill anyone!

761
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,680
I don't even know the deceased;

762
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,240
why would I kill him?

763
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,920
[When a person is lying,]

764
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,360
[they tend to blink excessively, often]

765
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,520
[accompanied by a nose-wrinkling gesture.]

766
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,960
[But just now, when he claimed]

767
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,280
[he didn't kill anyone,]

768
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,280
[his demeanor was remarkably resolute,]

769
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,440
[indicating he wasn't lying.]

770
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,880
Since you don't know the deceased,

771
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,840
how did you witness him being murdered?

772
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,800
I didn't see the murder

773
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,840
take place;

774
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,320
when I arrived,

775
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,480
the person was already dead.

776
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,320
According to you,

777
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,160
you saw someone

778
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,520
abducting Lady Du.

779
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
What characteristics does he have?

780
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,040
At that moment,

781
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,040
the lighting wasn't very good,

782
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,960
so I couldn't see clearly.

783
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,080
However,

784
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,600
based on the deceased's height

785
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,840
and demeanor,

786
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,480
he must have been

787
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,960
the one who abducted Lady Du.

788
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,840
You're only judging

789
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,280
by height and demeanor?

790
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,320
Didn't you notice

791
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,600
any other distinguishing features?

792
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,080
The event unfolded so suddenly, so

793
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,560
I didn't pay attention to anything else.

794
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,320
My lord, Du Xiaowan has arrived!

795
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,920
Xiaowan, my dear Xiaowan!

796
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,560
It's alright now, my girl.

797
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,680
Everything is fine.

798
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,480
Du Xiaowan,

799
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,320
[you are the key witness.]

800
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,160
[Please recount everything]

801
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,400
[that happened today.]

802
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,800
Xiaowan,

803
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,080
we have already made our vows.

804
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,480
You are now my wife.

805
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
I, Li Zimo, swear to God here

806
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,720
that I will never hold a grudge

807
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,840
because of today's events.

808
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,800
Lady Du, I understand

809
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,760
that women value their reputation,

810
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,120
which makes it difficult for you to speak,

811
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,040
but have you considered that

812
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,920
if the murderer isn't brought to justice,

813
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,880
more young women

814
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,040
will fall victim in the future?

815
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,320
They may not all be as fortunate as you

816
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,960
to have a chance of being rescued.

817
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,800
My lady,

818
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,720
let's help Lord Mo

819
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,720
capture the murderer,

820
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,680
alright?

821
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,440
After we performed the wedding rites,

822
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,160
I saw the attendant in the bridal chamber,

823
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,520
but then,

824
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
I suddenly fainted

825
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,000
[for reasons I don't understand.]

826
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,440
[When I came to,]

827
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,320
[I found myself in a sack,]

828
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,480
[and I didn't see who had taken me.]

829
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,560
[I was terrified at that moment,]

830
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
[unable to scream,]

831
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,640
[only aware that I]

832
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,080
[was trapped in the sack,]

833
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,880
[being carried on someone's shoulder.]

834
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,520
[After what felt like an eternity,]

835
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,920
[I was finally set down.]

836
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,120
Then another person arrived.

837
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,000
Did you hear

838
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,320
what they were discussing?

839
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I initially thought that person

840
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,400
was there to rescue me,

841
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,360
but to my surprise,

842
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,600
the two of them were actually accomplices.

843
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,560
They were discussing how

844
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,120
to share me,

845
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,000
and their words were truly unbearable.

846
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,480
I simply couldn't bring myself to say it.

847
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,240
My lord,

848
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,520
my wife has suffered such humiliation.

849
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,080
I implore you,

850
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,480
please punish the murderer severely.

851
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,640
Mr. Li, rest assured,

852
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,160
we will ensure the murderer

853
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,200
does not escape justice.

854
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,320
Then, I'm not sure what happened,

855
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,480
but the two of them began to argue.

856
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,360
[I made a mistake;]

857
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,440
[let her go.]

858
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,640
[Be serious!]

859
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,400
[The die is cast;]

860
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,480
[you have to go through with it!]

861
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,880
[I'll check over there.]

862
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,240
[After a while, I thought]

863
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,320
[I heard someone chasing from behind,]

864
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,960
[so they discarded me into]

865
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,360
[the abandoned well.]

866
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,400
[Before they could cover the well,]

867
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,280
[I heard a scream,]

868
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,120
[followed by a thud,]

869
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,280
[as if someone]

870
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,680
[had fallen beside me.]

871
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,200
[The sack loosened,]

872
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,560
[and I managed to crawl out.]

873
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Help!

874
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,240
[I heard someone approaching,]

875
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,440
[but I was afraid it was]

876
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,040
[the accomplice who had fled earlier,]

877
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,200
so I stopped calling out.

878
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,640
It wasn't until someone

879
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,720
jumped down the well

880
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,760
that I was finally rescued.

881
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,320
Since you overheard their conversation,

882
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,200
can you identify by his voice

883
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,040
if that person

884
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,640
was Xu Jize?

885
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,000
The situation was dire,

886
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,280
and I was terrified.

887
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,400
I was so scared that my head was spinning,

888
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,880
and I couldn't discern whose voice it was.

889
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,720
Lady Du has made it

890
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,680
quite clear.

891
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,600
In her final moments before fainting,

892
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,720
she saw Xu Jize.

893
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,760
Regardless of if you are the murderer,

894
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,040
this case

895
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,840
is undoubtedly connected to you.

896
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,480
I...

897
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,160
Xu Jize, you scoundrel!

898
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,400
Bastard!

899
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,520
Animal!

900
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,960
Silence!

901
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,040
What an animal!

902
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,560
You must not act unruly in court!

903
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,720
My lady,

904
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,880
Lord Shen cannot come in person,

905
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
so I was sent to present the evidence

906
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,800
to the court.

907
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,440
There is evidence,

908
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
and there are follow-up actions.

909
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,320
Why didn't you report it sooner?

910
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm not your subordinate.

911
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
Why should I report everything to you?

912
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,640
No wonder you work under that man;

913
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,200
you're truly petty!

914
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,400
Xu Jize,

915
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,760
now that it has come to this,

916
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
what else do you have to say?

917
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,920
My lord,

918
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,120
I'm truly wronged!

919
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,480
On the wedding day,

920
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,440
it's common for the bride to go

921
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,280
without food all day

922
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,600
and fall into a deep sleep.

923
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,680
Seeing the bride lacking energy,

924
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,640
I immediately left the room

925
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,080
to avoid any embarrassment.

926
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,720
Then the culprit abducted the bride,

927
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,320
and only then did I chase after him!

928
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,560
Stop trying to weasel out of it!

929
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,360
What happened after you chased out?

930
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,720
What did you see? Speak!

931
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,920
I'm not sure how far I chased,

932
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,800
but then

933
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,200
I saw

934
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,480
a shadow with a knife.

935
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,800
The person who abducted Lady Du

936
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,000
was lying nearby.

937
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,920
As a mere scholar,

938
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,320
physical strength isn't my forte,

939
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,000
so I dared not confront him.

940
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,400
I turned and ran

941
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,040
until I encountered the guardsmen,

942
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,480
which saved my life.

943
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,720
My lady,

944
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,480
what is this for?

945
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,920
Men and women should keep a respectful distance.

946
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,480
Mr. Xu, the embroidery on your clothes

947
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,040
is truly exquisite.

948
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,280
The peach blossom pattern at the collar,

949
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,760
I wonder which fair lady

950
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,960
embroidered it for you?
