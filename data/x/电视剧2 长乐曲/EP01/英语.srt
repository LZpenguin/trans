[Emperor Xiao Huan and the Crown Prince]

Long live the emperor!

My lord,

16
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,160
I conducted interrogations all night.

17
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
The suspects confessed to their crimes,

18
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,920
but refuse to identify the mastermind.

19
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,280

27
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,920
Take them away.

28
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Next time,

29
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,760
don't wait for me to intervene.

30
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,640
Understood.

31

[Let's go to the palace.]

32
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,040
I have heard that mother was

33
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,720
mourning the passing of the Royal Advisor,

34
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,880
and you're indisposed,

35
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,960
so I  was copying scriptures until dawn

36
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,120
to pray for mother's recovery.

37
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,200
You show such filial devotion,

38
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,720
which brings great comfort to me.

39
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,160
Thanks to you, Lord Zhang.

40
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,400
You have taught him exceptionally well.

41
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,560
I cannot take any credit for that.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,880
It is truly the virtue of His Highness.

43
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
[Filial, respectful and loyal.]

44
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,600
[He is kind-hearted and benevolent.]

45
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
[It is simply his nature.]

46
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
Lord Shen didn't attend the assembly, huh?

47
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,880
Lord Shen's been occupied with his duties.

48
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,160
He's known for his remarkable feats.

49
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,480
Perhaps he simply

50
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
has no time to attend the assembly.

51
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,200
[The Imperial Guard's (IG) head, Shen Du, arrives!]

52

Greetings, Your Highness.

53
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
No formalities, Lord Shen.

54
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,080
Your Highness,

55
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
I was just at the headquarters,

56
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,560
busy with the investigation of

57
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,840
the case involving 100 missing children.

58
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
The suspects have all confessed.

59
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
That's why I came in late.

60
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,640
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

61
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,160
This case has caused great anxiety

62
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,640
among the people of Xiang'an City.

63
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,840
I entrusted this case to you,

64
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
and it seems I did the right thing.

65
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Lord Shen,

66
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
it's quite a coincidence.

67
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,760
Early this morning,

68
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,800
Lord Zhang came to me

69
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,320
to request a reward for you.

70
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Lord Shen has consistently

71
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,520
turned the tide in difficult situations.

72
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,160
Truly, he is a paragon among us.

73
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,720
Gratitude, Lord Zhang.

74
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,320
I was simply doing my job.

75
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,640
I desire no reward.

76
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,840
Lord Zhang and the Imperial Guard

77
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,360
have always been at odds with each other.

78
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,680
Now, this is

79
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
turning hostility into goodwill, huh?

80
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,280
Yongan.

81
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,160
My apologies.

82
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
My officials are so harmonious and united.

83
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
This is a blessing for the royal family.

84
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,200
Lord Shen,

85
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,160
today I wish to

86
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,720
grant you a marriage.

87
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,960
What do you think?

88
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,920
[White Death always acts on his own terms.]

89
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,560
[Sir, how do you know]

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,880
[that he will agree]

91
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,000
[to this marriage today?]

92
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,080
[Shen Du is known as the White Death.]

93
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,240
[His cruelty is merely toward the enemy.]

94
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,520
To the Empress Dowager

95
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,120
he is simply a

96
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
courtier eager to gain favor.

97
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,000
Does he fear that resisting the marriage

98
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,000
will lead to losing

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,760
the Empress Dowager's trust?

100
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,080
[Even if you are a ghost of misfortune,]

101
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,160
[you still have your own desires.]

102
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,360
Xing!

103
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
- Good morning, Xing!
- Good morning.

104
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,000

105
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,400
- Morning, Xing.
- Xing!

106
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,920
Good morning!

107
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,160
Clerk Yan, morning.

108
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,440
[Watch out!]

109
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
[Those are the petals I just dried.]

110
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,360
[Watch out.]

111
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
[I'm sorry, clerk Yan.]

112
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
It's all right, it's all right.

113
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,600
- Good morning, Yan Xing.
- Morning.

114
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,080
- Morning.
- Morning, Xing.

115
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240

- Morning.

116
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,360
[You didn't have breakfast,]

117
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,640
[did you?]

118
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,440
I've had enough of this.

119
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,280
See?

120
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,200
[Women are useless]

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,920
[in the Ministry of Justice!]

122
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,200
[If Lady Xu, the Chief Royal Steward who's]

123
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,320
[close to the Empress Dowager heard it,]

124
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,400
[she'll blame you for hindering her plans]

125
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,880
[to allow women to serve as officials.]

126
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,160
Aren't you extremely talkative today?

127
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
You've done your work or something?

128
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,920
Get back to work!

129
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,640
Attend to the archives!

130
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,120
My lord.

131
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,880
Yan Xing!

132
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Tea!

133
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,600
My lord.

134
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,640
Today,

135
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
from the inspector,

136
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,280
a case has come in

137
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,760
regarding a woman

138
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,400
[from Yan Gui Mountain.]

139
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,240
[It is said that she encountered a ghost]

140
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,640
[and hanged herself.]

141
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
[My lord, you've got to know that]

142
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,800
I've been

143
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,840
overwhelmed with

144
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,920
these trivial cases.

145
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,160
Me and my subordinates

146
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,080
can't even find time to sleep,

147
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
let alone

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
have our meals.

149
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm requesting from the higher authorities

150
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
to increase our manpower.

151
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,040
[Yeah.]

152
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
[Two years ago,]

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,440
it took us some effort to recruit a clerk,

154
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,200
and it turned out to be

155
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,480
a woman.

156
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
As for this case,

157
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,000
we'll wait for the inspector

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,800
to complete his investigation.

159
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
Then we can file it...

160
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360
To avoid future complications.

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes, my lord.

162
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
[Yan Gui Mountain?]

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,920
[Suicide?]

164
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,160
You Xiang'an folks disregard propriety.

165
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,960
In my place, the death of a county official

166
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,800
means no one dares to hang festive silks.

167
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,560
The Royal Advisor has passed away

168
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,640
for barely a month, right?

169
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,680
This place is all decorated,

170
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,720
without any sense of taboo.

171
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
What do you know?

172
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,640
The Royal Advisor was

173
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,760
a saint who understood the will of God.

174
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,480
He even...

175
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,640
He even prophesied the

176
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Empress Dowager's governance.

177
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,600
Really?

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
It'll surely be a scene for his funeral!

179
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,800
All officials must pay respects today.

180
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,600
The Dark Demon is coming!

181
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,720
Go inside!

182
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,360
Hide yourself, now!

183
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,920
Who is this?

184
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,480
How come everyone is acting

185
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
like they are seeing a ghost?

186
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,680
You don't know him?

187
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
He established the Imperial Inspectorate (II),

188
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,080
specializing in surveillance and torture.

189
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,320
I've heard they possess hundreds

190
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
of torture devices.

191
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,600
Anyone who enters

192
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
never escapes unscathed.

193
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,320
If anyone resists,

194
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,560
they would wish for a quick death!

195
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
[White Death is coming!]

196
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,840
[White Death is also heading this way!]

197
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,240
So this is the "White Death?"

198
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
White Death is

199
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Commander Shen of the Imperial Guard.

200
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
The Imperial Guard is quite powerful.

201
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
It's directly under the Empress Dowager.

202
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
They handle investigations, surveillance,

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,960
and assassinations.

204
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,760
[Stop crying!]

205
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,920
[The White Death is here.]

206
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Just hearing his name,

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,400
the clouds disperse in broad daylight,

208
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,440
and it stops kids from crying at night!

209
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,960
Now their convoys

210
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
have run into each other.

211
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,240
There's going to be a good show.

212
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,760
The street isn't very wide.

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,960
Who will yield first?

214
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Who knows?

215
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Let's watch!

216
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Stop!

217
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,560
Commander Shen is coming after all.

218
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,040
I thought

219
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,960
you would be too busy

220
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,400
preparing for your wedding.

221
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,840
My wedding is nothing

222
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,840
compared to state affairs.

223
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,360
Lord Zhang made the request,

224
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,280
and Her Highness graciously approved it.

225
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,200
This indicates that Commander Shen's

226
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
marriage is indeed significant.

227
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,400
It's a pity, though,

228
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,520
that the previous brides

229
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,240
lacked a bit of fortune.

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,520
Very funny, Chancellor Lai.

231
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,920
To avoid missing the auspicious time,

232
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,720
we should set off now.

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,720
This street is just too narrow.

234
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,800
It could hardly accommodate

235
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,720
the passage of our people.

236
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,920
Clear the way on both sides.

237
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
Get them removed!

238
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,040
So both II and IG

239
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
could get through.

240
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,040
Commander, please!

241
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,640
Let's go!

242
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,560
[Shen Du?]

243
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,760
I've been waiting for you two.

244
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,320
Greetings, Lord Zhang.

245
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,240
Greetings, Lord Zhang.

246
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,600
I apologize for being late.

247
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
But it seems you arrived just in time.

248
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,840
It's the auspicious moment now.

249
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,680
Everyone,

250
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,040
let's start the ceremony.

251
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,120
[The auspicious moment is upon us!]

252
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,360
Gratitude, Clerk Yan,

253
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,040
if it weren't for you, we wouldn't

254
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,720
have uncovered the true culprit.

255
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,960
You're welcome.

256
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,920
Conducting verifications for murder cases

257
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,560
is the duty of the Ministry of Justice.

258
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaking of which,

259
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,600
a few days ago,

260
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,880
you asked us to assist in investigating

261
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,040
the herbs that can detect poison.

262
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,400
I have received some info.

263
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,560
There are some on a nearby mountain.

264
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,960
Why not accompany our carriage

265
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,160
and go up the mountain to collect them?

266
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,680
There's no need to trouble yourselves.

267
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,840
You should return and report back.

268
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,440
I can handle it myself.

269
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,200
If that's the case,

270
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,640
then I'll take my leave.

271
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,080
So long.

272
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Today's prayer was successfully conducted,

273
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,360
thanks to Lord Zhang's oversight,

274
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,760
so we could proceed smoothly.

275
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,840
In the coming year,

276
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
our Great nation will surely

277
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,400
realize the Royal Advisor's prophecy,

278
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,920
bringing peace to the realm.

279
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
The officials' prayers for blessings are

280
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,320
attributed to His Highness, Prince Xian,

281
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
who has visited some remarkable figures

282
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,120
and chosen this auspicious day

283
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,360
to allay Her Highness' concerns.

284
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,520
I was merely following orders,

285
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,760
fulfilling my duties as a loyal subject.

286
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
[Our Great Cang,]

287
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,960
[with a wise ruler and virtuous officials,]

288
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,360
[we are fortunate to live in]

289
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,080
[such an era of]

290
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,280
[peace and prosperity!]

291
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,040
[Indeed.]

292
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,200
[Absolutely.]

293
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,400
[Assassin!]

294
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,680
[Secure the mountain perimeter.]

295
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,120
Lady, are you gathering

296
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,120
these leaves for medicinal purposes?

297
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,520
No.

298
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm using them for autopsy...

299
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,680
That's right.

300
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
I am using them for medicinal purposes.

301
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,440
How did you know?

302
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,600
Just looking at your outfit gives it away.

303
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,800
You're a healer, aren't you?

304
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,800
I suppose you could say that.

305
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,159
Here, take this.

306
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,240
I've gathered enough already.

307
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,919
Aunt Zhang from my village fell sick,

308
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,159
so I came to gather some for her.

309
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,800
Last time, the healer mentioned

310
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,960
that soaking this in water is beneficial.

311
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,080
Let me pay you.

312
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,159
No need for payment!

313
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,240
I just randomly picked it up.

314
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,080
Thank you very much!

315
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,400
Lady,

316
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
my name is Qi Yeyun.

317
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
What's your name?

318
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,440
Are you heading down the mountain?

319
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,520
I can show you a shortcut.

320
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,280
I will be faster.

321
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,680
Halt!

322
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,360
Today,

323
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,560
no one is allowed to go down the mountain.

324
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,640
What's going on?

325
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,400
I'm a clerk from the Ministry of Justice.

326
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Stop talking.

327
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,120
Come with us.

328
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,760
Hurry, let's go!

329
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,440
What's happening here?

330
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,720
Chancellor Lai,

331
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
everyone from the mountain

332
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,800
has been brought here.

333
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,200
On the day of the prayer for blessings,

334
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,280
how could anyone

335
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,600
dare to assassinate a court official?

336
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,080
[I narrowly escaped an arrow.]

337
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,880
[But I have lost my beloved subordinate.]

338
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,720
Today,

339
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,320
I'll definitely have my revenge.

340
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,240
Assassin?

341
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
Who might that be?

342
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,960
He is in your midst.

343
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,120
I advise the assassin

344
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,560
to confess now.

345
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,560
I can ensure you

346
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,040
a more merciful death.

347
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,440
If you refuse to confess,

348
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,080
you will still not escape.

349
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Within one incense's time,

350
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
if no one confesses,

351
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,440
there will be no mercy.

352
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,360
Wait!

353
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Chancellor Lai,

354
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,720
I'm clerk Yan Xing from the Ministry of Justice.

355
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,680
I beg your permission to examine the corpse.

356
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,200
Perhaps I can determine

357
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,120
who the assassin is.

358
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,560
Granted!

359
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,320
[It's now the hour of the rooster (5pm.)]

360
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,440
[The sun is setting in the west.]

361
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
[So the shooting position...]

362
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,080
What do you think, Ms. clerk?

363
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,800
Can you tell me

364
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,000
who the assassin is now?

365
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,720
I have not yet identified

366
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
who the assassin is.

367
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,720
However,

368
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,680
the assassin used a long-range shot.

369
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,920
The bright sunlight

370
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
would have affected his aim.

371
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,040
Therefore, he must have been on

372
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,600
the shady side during the assassination.

373
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,320
Considering the direction

374
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,240
from which the arrow struck,

375
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
the best hiding spot

376
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,360
would be in a tree.

377
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,360
Located on the northwest peak,

378
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,640
in the high forest.

379
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,720
After the incident, the II

380
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,480
immediately sealed off the mountain,

381
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,200
so the people from other mountains

382
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,680
could not possibly be the assassin.

383
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,120
Chancellor Lai,

384
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,920
I urge you

385
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,080
to release the

386
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
innocent civilians.

387
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,800
I have already

388
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,320
made myself clear.

389
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,360
The condition for their release

390
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,800
is to find out who the assassin is.

391
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
You have not achieved that.

392
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,840
Execute them all.

393
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,480
Chancellor Lai,

394
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,360
I have a more amusing idea.

395
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,400
Simply killing the assassin

396
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,680
is too unremarkable.

397
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,680
I have raised a few fighting hounds,

398
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
and their ability to tear apart criminals

399
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,400
is quite impressive.

400
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,880
Why not let my dogs

401
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,080
come out and have a feast?

402
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
Although the killing will be a bit slow,

403
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,960
it will be

404
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,640
quite entertaining.

405
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
I truly feel that

406
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,840
my nickname "Dark Demon"

407
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,040
pales in comparison to

408
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,640
Commander Shen.

409
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm truly humbled.

410
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,440
Jinglin.

411
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Don't come any closer!

412
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,040
Stop!

413
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,160
Stay away from me!

414
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Get away!

415
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,440
No, no!

416
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,840
The assassin is among these people.

417
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,040
The assassin must be someone

418
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,240
with considerable strength and speed

419
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,200
and capable of climbing.

420
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,120
Chancellor Lai,

421
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,840
you can deal with

422
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
these individuals now.

423
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,920
Let me think,

424
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,600
what kind of punishment

425
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,400
would be most fitting for them.

426
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,600
I implore you, Lord Lai,

427
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,240
to wait a bit before taking action.

428
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,080
Just give me a bit more time,

429
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,880
and I will surely identify

430
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
the true assassin.

431
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,640
I swear on my life.

432
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,720
Commander Shen,

433
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
how much time do you think

434
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,760
I should give her?

435
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,920
Six hours.

436
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,200
After six hours,

437
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,760
if you still cannot uncover the truth,

438
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,080
then you can join them in death.

439
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,760
[For those who wield bows and arrows,]

440
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,880
[there'll be calluses in three spots on hands.]

441
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,720
[This one only has calluses on his palm,]

442
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,160
[so he's innocent.]

443
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,120
My lord,

444
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,320
Lai Luozhi wants to identify the assassin.

445
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,400
Yet he handed over the suspects and

446
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,640
the investigation to the Imperial Guard.

447
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,600
Claiming that he wants

448
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
our dogs to carry out the execution.

449
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,400
Do you think

450
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
there might be some trickery at play?

451
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,000
What trickery could there be?

452
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,640
It's simply that he is confident

453
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,120
the clerk won't be able to figure it out.

454
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,000
He won't kill anyone from the Ministry of Justice.

455
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,720
That will get himself into trouble.

456
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,720
If he's trying to avoid trouble,

457
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,280
are you not concerned

458
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,600
about causing a scandal?

459
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,920
I've been a son of a criminal before,

460
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,480
so what's there to fear?

461
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
[The assassin's position was]

462
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
[at the high point of the northwest peak,]

463
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,600
[and the forest there]

464
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
[is a lacquer tree forest.]

465
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,000
[If someone touches lacquer trees,]

466
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
[they will develop rashes.]

467
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,680
[And when the guards]

468
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
[apprehended the suspects during the day,]

469
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,600
[none of them exhibited any rashes.]

470
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,800
[Those with severe rashes]

471
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,320
[can be ruled out as]

472
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,000
[potential suspects hiding in the forest.]

473
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,160
[This man in the middle,]

474
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,040
[the dirt on his shoes]

475
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,640
[is not from the lacquer tree forest.]

476
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,400
[Thus, he can be ruled out.]

477
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
If we can locate the murder weapon,

478
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
we will identify the killer.

479
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,320
[Why is it so bright here?]

480
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,120
Do you have any last words?

481
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,000
Six hours are almost up.

482
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,440
You haven't discovered who the killer is.

483
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,720
Wait for the guards

484
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,080
to find the murder weapon in the forest

485
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,760
and compare it,

486
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,200
- then
- You don't need to explain anything to me.

487
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,880
You're running out of time.

488
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,800
Finding the murder weapon

489
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,760
doesn't guarantee you'll identify him,

490
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,280
right?

491
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,200
Does a lack of complete confidence

492
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,160
stop you from taking action?

493
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
To gamble your life

494
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,840
without full confidence

495
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,160
is either incredibly foolish

496
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
or shows a lack of self-respect.

497
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,800
When the time comes, I'll leave a letter,

498
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,320
please ensure it is delivered to Erudite

499
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,320
Yan's residence in the east of the city.

500
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,920
Take clerk Yan away,

501
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,160
and see her off properly.

502
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,680
Yes, my lord.

503
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,440
Commander Shen!

504
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,920
Do you truly not recognize me?

505
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,560
Do I have to recognize you?

506
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,120
[My lord,]

507
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
[the murder weapon has been uncovered.]

508
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,800
[Just as clerk Yan suspected,]

509
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,440
[it was buried beneath a lacquer tree.]

510
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,280
Seems you have quite the stroke of luck.

511
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,760
The murder weapon

512
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
was discovered at the very last moment.

513
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,240
By checking the bow

514
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,680
and the calluses on their hands,

515
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,080
I can identify the assassin.

516
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
It appears I'm having a fortunate day.

517
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,080
I arrived just in time.

518
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,000
Lord Lai, your timing is impeccable.

519
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,240
It must be more than just luck, right?

520
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,920
The murder weapon was transported from

521
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,240
Yan Gui Mountain to the Imperial Guard.

522
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,520
The news must have

523
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,480
already reached the Imperial Inspectorate.

524
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,720
Six hours have passed.

525
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,480
Clerk Yan, you need to hurry.

526
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm very eager to see

527
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,480
who had the audacity

528
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,600
to make attempts on my life.

529
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,480
You two,

530
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,440
please

531
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,920
hold the bow

532
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
as you normally would.

533
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,440
I've figured out who the assassin is.

534
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,920
The calluses on their hands

535
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
are nearly identical,

536
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,880
but the calluses from holding the bow

537
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,000
are distinctly different.

538
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,760
One of them has

539
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,560
calluses on the inner side of his thumb,

540
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,240
indicating he uses the

541
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,560
inner side of his thumb to hold the bow.

542
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,960
This method of holding the bow

543
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,560
is known to those skilled in archery

544
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,040
as a low push with a slanted grip,

545
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,800
which compromises the accuracy.

546
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,000
The other suspect

547
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
has calluses on the web of his thumb,

548
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,120
indicating he uses a high push grip, which

549
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,560
is advantageous for precise shooting.

550
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,200
Therefore,

551
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,920
the assassin is you.

552
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,640
Don't move! Everyone, stay still!

553
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,160
Step back! Step back!

554
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Don't come any closer!

555
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,800
Let me go!

556
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,960
Or I'll kill her!

557
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Do you even realize where you are at?

558
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,280
Do you really believe you can escape?

559
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,520
Tell me who is behind this,

560
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,280
and I might spare your life.

561
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
You better release her!

562
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,920
Since we have both the suspect and

563
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,600
the evidence, we don't need a confession.

564
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,840
Prepare to execute.

565
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,520
You!

566
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,280
Are you going to shoot her as well?

567
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,240
She's not even part of my Imperial Guard.

568
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,160
She's a mere clerk

569
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,120
with no official rank.

570
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,360
Losing her

571
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,320
won't matter.

572
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,080
Shen Du,

573
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,800
you heartless White Death!

574
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,520
How can you be so ruthless?

575
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,440
If you go down with the assassin,

576
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,440
I will deem you a hero of the empire.

577
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,160
As far as I know,

578
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,720
the salary of a clerk is meager,

579
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,920
but the Ministry of Justice provides the

580
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,960
highest compensation among all ministries.

581
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
Your parents didn't raise you for nothing.

582
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,880
Even if I become a ghost,

583
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,280
I'll come back and haunt you!

584
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,440
Good.

585
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,400
The least I fear in my life

586
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
is a haunting ghost.

587
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,280
Don't move! Everyone, stay still!

588
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,920
Thank you.

589
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
That's not half bad.

590
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
[There's no way out,]

591
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,160
fine!

592
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,680
Tell me,

593
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,640
who sent you to kill me?

594
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,400
It's...

595
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,080
It's him!

596
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,360
Commander Shen, no wonder

597
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,080
you were so eager to silence him.

598
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,200
Impressive!

599
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,200
Lord Lai,

600
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,560
you believe the last words

601
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,920
of a dying criminal?

602
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,440
Isn't that ridiculous?

603
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,560
Who do you think you are,

604
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,160
to speak to Lord Lai like that?

605
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,440
Lord Lai, I urge you to reconsider.

606
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,480
If it really was the commander,

607
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,320
the Imperial Guard

608
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,240
wouldn't have bothered to make arrests

609
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,360
and search for evidence.

610
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,080
They could have silenced him early on.

611
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,400
I was just joking.

612
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,560
How could I possibly believe it was you?

613
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
Don't take it seriously.

614
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,040
I

615
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,440
never took it seriously.

616
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,160
The murderer has been brought to justice.

617
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
I'm at ease then.

618
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,920
There's no need for me to linger in here.

619
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,840
I'll take my leave now.

620
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,320
We failed our duties to watch over

621
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,680
the suspect; please punish us.

622
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,200
The assassin is dead. Forget about it.

623
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,240
You all,

624
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,240
escort clerk Yan

625
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,440
and the others

626
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,240
out of here.

627
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,960
Yes, my lord.

628
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,560
My Lord,

629
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,920
I noticed that little girl

630
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,000
was staring at you.

631
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,280
She doesn't seem to be afraid of you.

632
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,640
What's so surprising about that?

633
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,320
In this Xiang'an city,

634
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,120
aren't there plenty of idle women?

635
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,880
That's true.

636
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,040
Your looks

637
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,080
could indeed attract some

638
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,640
reckless and horny women.

639
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,160
One more word, I'll

640
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,080
reassign you to Imperial Inspectorate.

641
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,680
Please don't!

642
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,640
I just want to work for the Imperial Guard

643
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,600
for a lifetime.

644
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,160
Oh, I see.

645
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,640
The Lady Yan (third eldest daughter) you are to marry

646
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,920
is from the Yan Family.

647
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,200
This girl (six eldest daughter)

648
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,680
is your sister-in-law!

649
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,880
She seems to

650
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,480
be quite smart,

651
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,000
understanding that I was trying

652
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
to save her.

653
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,320
As for being my sister-in-law...

654
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,960
That depends on whether her sister

655
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,720
has the courage

656
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,840
to marry me, Shen Du.

657
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,280
What the...

658
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,560
Gratitude, lady Yan!

659
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Please, get up.

660
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,200
As a staff of the Ministry of Justice,

661
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,480
this is simply part of my duty.

662
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,440
[If it weren't for your sharp insights,]

663
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,640
[we might not have made it alive]

664
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,680
[to reunite with our families again.]

665
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,880
It's getting late.

666
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,480
You should all head home.

667
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,799
Thank you once again, lady Yan.

668
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,160
Let's go.

669
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,680
Lady.

670
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,960
Your amazing skills are a marvel to behold.

671
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
You are truly resourceful, and

672
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,000
you didn't hesitate to face danger,

673
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
saving my life.

674
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,520
Come on.

675
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,759
I wish to become your disciple.

676
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:59,160
Don't reject me please.

677
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
I'm just a

678
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,480
lowly clerk with no official rank.

679
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,880
How could I possibly take on a disciple?

680
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,719
Besides,

681
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,799
your parents

682
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:07,520
would never allow you

683
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,000
to take a woman as your master.

684
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,719
I am an orphan.

685
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,920
I was raised in the village of

686
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,120
Yan Gui Mountain by the villagers.

687
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,239
If I choose a master,

688
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,200
I'm determined to become her disciple.

689
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,680
But you are not

690
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,120
the disciple she chooses,

691
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,880
young man.

692
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,120
Lady.

693
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,080
Is that what you thought?

694
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,240
Get in, Xing.

695
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,800
So long.

696
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,160
Yeah,

697
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,800
how did you know that

698
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
I was at the Imperial Guard?

699
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,880
It was the worker from

700
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
my family's shop

701
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,760
who informed me.

702
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,840
He mentioned that

703
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,320
his cousin's classmate's

704
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
female cousin's sister-in-law

705
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,520
saw several villagers

706
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,800
and a female clerk

707
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,360
from the Ministry of Justice

708
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,160
being taken to the Imperial Guard.

709
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
A female clerk from

710
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,400
the Ministry of Justice,

711
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,160
who else could it be but you?

712
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,920
So it seems that

713
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,600
worker from your family is better suited

714
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
for the Ministry of Justice than you are.

715
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,320
At first, when I heard the news,

716
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,600
I was really worried.

717
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,640
But then I found out

718
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,920
you were there to investigate a case,

719
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,840
and I felt

720
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,520
completely at ease.

721
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,680
In this world,

722
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,840
is there any case

723
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,200
that you, Yan Xing, couldn't solve?

724
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,480
Besides,

725
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,520
you have connections

726
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,000
at the Imperial Guard, don't you?

727
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,920
No way!

728
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,880
That Shen Du

729
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,120
hasn't recognized you yet?

730
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,120
Is he blind or what?

731
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,680
Never mind.

732
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,400
I think I should take you home first.

733
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
I'm not going home.

734
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,840
Drop me off at the Ministry of Justice.

735
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,880
The Ministry of Justice?

736
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,600
Yan Xing!

737
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm signing up for the female official exam tomorrow.

738
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,080
All the women

739
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,880
in Xiang'an City

740
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,680
are eager to become

741
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,840
renowned ladies

742
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,720
like your third sister.

743
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,640
I guess you are the only girl who's eager

744
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,880
to become a female official.

745
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,560
You've already become a female official,

746
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,400
so I can't fall behind!

747
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,440
Don't worry.

748
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,120
This year I'll definitely become a proper

749
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,880
female official at the Ministry of Justice.

750
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,680
Turn right up ahead

751
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,560
to the Ministry of Justice.

752
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,960
My Lord,

753
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,920
the assassin have committed suicide.

754
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,600
In this case,

755
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,120
the competition between those two

756
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,920
is going to be even more amusing.

757
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,080
Did you find out what the

758
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,040
prophecy was

759
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,240
before the Royal Advisor died?

760
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,120
It is said that the prophecy

761
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,360
mentions the phoenix leading nine chicks

762
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,760
and peace in the world,

763
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,880
and there's a second half.

764
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,120
But no one knows what it is.

765
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,840
It seems no one knows.

766
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,840
On the night he passed away,

767
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,120
the White Death and Dark Demon

768
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,480
were both present in the Ming Hall.

769
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,680
Those two

770
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
mysterious men are quite something.

771
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,040
What's going on?

772
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,200
I am Yan Xing.

773
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,080
Let me in!

774
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,960
[In accordance with heaven's will,]

775
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,360
[I receive this clear order.]

776
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,600
[The Yan Family has a daughter,]

777
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,960
[with remarkable poetic talent.]

778
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,440
[She excels in both writing and painting,]

779
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,960
[depicting phoenixes and dragons.]

780
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,360
[She is well-versed in classics,]

781
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,760
[knowledgeable in ancient and modern times.]

782
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,920
[Her reputation as a virtuous lady]

783
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,360
- [is unmatched in Xiang'an.]
- Mother.

784
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,560
[I have heard of her with great delight.]

785
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,240
[The CO of the Imperial Guard, Shen Du,]

786
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,080
[is of marriageable age.]

787
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,280
[He should pick a virtuous lady as his wife.]

788
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,160
[The Yan Family has a daughter,]

789
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,400
[perfectly matched with Shen Du.]

790
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,720
[To fulfill this union,]

791
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,160
[I grant them]

792
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,080
[to marry in three days.]

793
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
[I hereby decree.]

794
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,120
Erudite Yan.

795
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Receive the decree.

796
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,160
[Shen Du?]

797
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
My gratitude, Your Highness!

798
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,040
Thank you, my lord.

799
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,400
Congratulations, Erudite Yan,

800
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,000
for raising a daughter like Caiwei,

801
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,400
who is renowned for her talent and virtue.

802
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,440
My Caiwei!

803
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,640
She can't get married!

804
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,320
Regarding a daughter's marriage,

805
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,120
it has to be the parents' decision

806
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,600
and the matchmaker's words.

807
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,720
Moreover, this is a marriage

808
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,080
granted by the Empress Dowager herself.

809
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,680
That's the White Death!

810
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,800
If our Caiwei marries him,

811
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,800
then

812
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,880
she will definitely suffer!

813
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,440
Things are unpredictable.

814
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,440
I never expected this, not at all.

815
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,080
It's tragic.

816
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,440
Mother,

817
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,320
why are you staring at me?

818
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,360
People say

819
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,840
great wisdom appears foolish.

820
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,640
Could it be talking about you?

821
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,000
I always feel that I have

822
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,720
no talents or renowned social status.

823
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,800
You were born as a concubine's daughter,

824
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,120
not being valued.

825
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,440
So I always want you

826
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,880
to learn from Caiwei,

827
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,800
to behave like a proper lady,

828
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,680
and find a good husband,

829
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,320
to secure a good path for your future.

830
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,440
Mother,

831
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,760
you know I don't like those things.

832
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,600
Yes,

833
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,000
I used to get angry,

834
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,760
blaming you for being foolish,

835
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,080
uneducated.

836
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,000
But now,

837
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,200
I suddenly feel

838
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,880
that being uneducated is actually good.

839
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,960
Being uneducated

840
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,600
can actually be quite nice.

841
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,680
Mother, I am not uneducated.

842
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,240
Just think about it,

843
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,080
with so many women in all of Xiang'an,

844
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,880
why is it that Caiwei

845
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,920
was chosen by the Empress Dowager?

846
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,840
It's because

847
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,200
her talent is truly exceptional.

848
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,480
Her mom has nurtured her since childhood

849
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,400
in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting,

850
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,920
and she excels in all of them.

851
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,000
But who would have thought that now

852
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,880
she would marry the White Death,

853
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,920
jumping into his underworld?

854
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,880
Mother,

855
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,880
Shen Du is the

856
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,360
commander of the Imperial Guard.

857
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,080
He's not as unworthy as you think.

858
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Do you think

859
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,520
Caiwei and her mother

860
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,880
