[EP34]

3
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,440
Watch me.

4
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,240
Like this.

5
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,400
A little pinch.

6
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
It doesn't work, why?

7
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,400
Here.

8
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,240
Shen Du, look! It's snowing!

9
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,480
Come here.

10
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,160
Look.

11
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,160
It's finally

12
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
snowing.

13
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,840
Did I go too far

14
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
with Lord Zhang today?

15
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,720
You can't possibly

16
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,360
keep pretending forever,

17
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,880
acting like a spy for him.

18
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,880
Eventually, this will come to an end.

19
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,480
But today,

20
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,680
you brought up the Shens' case.

21
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
Did you uncover

22
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,200
anything new?

23
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
I did it on purpose,

24
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
just to test his reaction.

25
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Now it seems

26
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
Lord Zhang definitely knows something.

27
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
These days,

28
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,880
all the clues are tangled and confusing,

29
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
and we still can't be entirely sure.

30
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,000
But one thing is clear,

31
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,280
that long before the Shens' incident,

32
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,000
there were multiple forces

33
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,520
beginning to plot behind the scenes.

34
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
I have a feeling.

35
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,680
What is it?

36
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,520
I was thinking,

37
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
the situation your father was in back then

38
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,520
is not too different from yours now.

39
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,960
I mean,

40
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,280
navigating among various fractions,

41
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,120
to stay impartial while keeping

42
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,440
dignity is no easy task.

43
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,440
A small misstep could lead to...

44
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
A fallen tree attracts many axes.

45
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,840
Staying true to yourself is right.

46
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
And it's also not wrong to avoid

47
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,160
bowing down to the powerful.

48
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Shen Du.

49
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,360
Please keep doing what you do,

50
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,560
and pursue what you desire.

51
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,520
I will do my utmost

52
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,240
to help you uncover the truth,

53
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,200
and clear the name of the Shen Family.

54
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
Snow on the winter solstice

55
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,840
is a sign of a fruitful year ahead.

56
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,680
Lord Commander is nothing special.

57
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,480
Let's see

58
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,840
if you can catch me.

59
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,360
Poker face, poker face!

60
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,560
Come on!

61
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,280
Chui!

62
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,320
Hurry!

63
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,400
How are you? Are you cold?

64
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,480
Absolutely freezing!

65
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,679
Feeling any better?

66
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,360
What were you doing?

67
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,640
I went to buy you some treat.

68
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
[Try it.]

69
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,920
It's good.

70
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,000
Slow down.

71
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,520
Your cheeks are all puffed up.

72
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,280
It's good!

73
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,920
Let's build a snowman!

74
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,080
Does it look like you?

75
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,720
Not even close.

76
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,880
This one looks like you!

77
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,840
Not at all.

78
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,520
Yours doesn't look like me at all!

79
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,280
Mine looks like you!

80
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
Yours is so chubby!

81
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,240
Easy.

82
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,960
Chui!

83
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,840
Catch me if you can!

84
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,400
It's snowing, take this!

85
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,400
[My beloved,]

86
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,920
you've always loved the winter snow.

87
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,720
You once said,

88
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,280
that snow is the purest,

89
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,680
capable of covering all the

90
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,080
filth and ugliness.

91
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,280
My beloved,

92
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
how have I conducted

93
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560
myself in your stead?

94
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,400
[Are you content?]

95
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,880
I am unaware of

96
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,920
any mistakes I may have made.

97
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,240
[When we]

98
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,920
reunite in

99
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,000
the netherworld,

100
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,080
will you blame me?

101
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520
Your Highness!

102
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,560
The incense smoke

103
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,520
stung my eyes.

104
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
Why are you back?

105
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,040
Didn't I ask you to

106
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,200
take a break for the festival?

107
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,640
Wan is already

108
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,120
accustomed to handling daily affairs.

109
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
Now that I have time off,

110
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,520
[I find it quite boring.]

111
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,400
Wan finds this snowy night

112
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,960
to be quite dull and lonely,

113
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,520
so I invited Mr. Jin to join me,

114
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,880
[hoping to entertain]

115
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,360
[Your Highness.]

116
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,600
Girl...

117
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,000
I know

118
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,280
you must feel that I

119
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,200
am solitary and heartbroken,

120
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,680
so you intentionally find

121
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,280
comforting words to console me.

122
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,240
Your Highness,

123
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,280
I have just composed a new melody

124
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,680
[titled "Melancholy and Mirth."]

125
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
I wonder if Your Highness

126
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
would care to hear it?

127
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,800
Prepare a feast.

128
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,640
For today we shall

129
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,560
eat and drink heartily,

130
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
just like the ordinary households,

131
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,600
and celebrate the Winter Solstice

132
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,080
with warmth and joy!

133
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,880
Don't melt! Don't melt!

134
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,720
You are not allowed to melt!

135
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,160
No!

136
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,920
No!

137
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,040
You are meant to be mine.

138
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,480
Mine!

139
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,880
I will not allow anyone

140
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
to snatch away what's meant for me!

141
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,440
Never!

142
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,600
Good.

143
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,480
Please.

144
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,760
Your Royal Highness,

145
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,000
Chancellor Lai requests an audience.

146
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,440
Summon him!

147
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,320
What brings him here

148
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,080
on such a snowy night?

149
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,320
Chancellor Lai,

150
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,680
[what could be so urgent]

151
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
that you've ventured out

152
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
on this snowy holiday eve?

153
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,640
Your Royal Highness,

154
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,880
I have just received an anonymous tip-off

155
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,960
stating that Yan Xing

156
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,440
was specifically arranged by Lord Zhang

157
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,800
to marry Lord Shen

158
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,360
[with the intention of winning him over.]

159
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,440
On the day of the winter solstice,

160
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,200
Lord Zhang even used the safety of the Yans

161
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
to coerce Yan Xing into compliance.

162
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
This is someone

163
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
trying to create trouble for no reason!

164
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,960
Does Yan Xing truly belong

165
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,080
to Prince Xian's faction?

166
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
[Your Highness,]

167
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm afraid that

168
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,080
there may be some misunderstanding.

169
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,760
The tip-off also mentioned

170
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,320
[that originally, Your Highness]

171
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,400
[granted a marriage decree]

172
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,840
[to the third daughter of the Yan Family,]

173
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,520
[but the Yan Family, with ulterior motives,]

174
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,600
[switched her with Xing.]

175
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,000
Now this Yan Xing has been promoted

176
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,960
to Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice.

177
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,760
[It is evident that the Yans' intentions]

178
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,920
[in this are treacherous!]

179
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
[Could Yan Xing's allegiance]

180
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,920
truly lie with Prince Xian?

181
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,680
Your Highness,

182
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,880
[Jin Zang humbly speaks.]

183
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,640
The sixth daughter, Yan Xing

184
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,200
is my niece.

185
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,800
[She has always dreamed of dedicating]

186
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,880
[herself to the imperial court]

187
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,720
[as a female detective.]

188
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,240
[Despite an unexpected marriage]

189
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,160
to the Shen Family,

190
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,200
her loyalty and sincerity

191
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,160
remain untainted.

192
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
[Please see her true nature, Your Highness.]

193
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,240
Jin Zang,

194
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,240
you have been permitted to perform in

195
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
my chamber for many years.

196
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,560
Meddling in state affairs, a new boldness!

197
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,440
I wouldn't dare, Your Highness.

198
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,000
Lord Lai,

199
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,880
regarding Yan Xing,

200
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,560
is it worth your late-night visit?

201
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,080
If you have any more urgent matters,

202
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,280
speak them all out at once.

203
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,440
I have just learned that

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
in Xiang'an City,

205
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
a nursery rhyme has suddenly spread,

206
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,560
[and it sounds quite inappropriate.]

207
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,840
A nursery rhyme?

208
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,280
Red porridge and dates,

209
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,000
five feet from the heaven.

210
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,920
[Citruses and loquats,]

211
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,200
[hard for lad to grasp.]

212
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,600
[Do not speak recklessly.]

213
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
[Who says,]

214
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,920
[granny is angry,]

215
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,200
[salt rises.]

216
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
Lady Xu is clever and graceful,

217
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,920
and she has clearly identified

218
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
the issues within.

219
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
[It directly targets Your Highness,]

220
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,520
["five feet from the heaven."]

221
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,560
"Hard for lad to grasp."

222
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
This is a blatant disrespect

223
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,640
to both Your Highness and His Majesty!

224
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,080
Insolence!

225
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,520
Such a rhyme

226
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
could not have appeared without reason.

227
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,760
[There must be wicked schemers]

228
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,120
plotting behind the scenes.

229
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,760
I urge Your Highness to take action!

230
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,080
Can we uncover

231
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,120
who is spreading such slander?

232
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,880
It's challenging to trace the source,

233
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,040
as it circulates among the children.

234
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,200
After all these years...

235
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,040
I have dedicated myself

236
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,960
wholeheartedly to the Xiao Family's reign,

237
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,800
[yet there are always those who suspect]

238
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,640
I act out of selfish motives.

239
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,000
To exploit a nursery rhyme

240
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,800
to manipulate public sentiment

241
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,360
is truly despicable!

242
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,520
We'll launch a full-scale investigation

243
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,960
immediately to ensure that we

244
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,760
take down the mastermind!

245
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,320
But...

246
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
What?

247
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,400
However, the melody used in this rhyme

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,240
was composed by Mr. Jin

249
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,120
[for the winter solstice banquet]

250
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,760
[at Prince Xian's residence.]

251
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,920
This melody is

252
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
titled "Melancholy and Mirth."

253
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,560
Your Royal Highness,

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,160
this piece was created by me

255
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,080
to honor the Winter Solstice.

256
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,880
[It was indeed performed for the first time]

257
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,920
[during the feast at the prince's residence.]

258
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,640
[However, this piece has no lyrics,]

259
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,200
and certainly no disloyal intentions.

260
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,920
But if the player

261
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,640
[is unintentional,]

262
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
[what if the listener has ulterior motives?]

263
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,400
[That last line of the rhyme,]

264
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
"granny is angry,"

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
"salt rises."

266
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,680
the "salt (xian)" in this line

267
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,440
likely refers to Prince Xian!

268
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,120
Summon Prince Xian!

269
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,680
Mother!

270
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,160
I am unaware!

271
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,480
I am being wronged!

272
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
[Regarding "Melancholy and Mirth,"]

273
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,280
I first heard it

274
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,160
during the banquet.

275
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,200
I didn't pay much attention at the time,

276
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,160
and I had no idea

277
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,080
that someone would seize this opportunity

278
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,920
to add lyrics that allude to Your Highness!

279
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
I firmly believe

280
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
this is not the doing of Mr. Jin,

281
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,840
nor is it instigated by His Highness.

282
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,160
[However, this piece was]

283
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
[just performed at the prince's residence]

284
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,600
and immediately had rebellious lyrics

285
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,920
added, spreading through the streets.

286
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,320
Moreover,

287
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,280
the ending of this rhyme clearly implies

288
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,680
that His Highness seeks advancement.

289
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,040
I urge you, mother, to see clearly

290
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,240
that someone is trying to use this rhyme

291
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,160
to sow discord between us,

292
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,080
to undermine our mother-son bond,

293
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,880
and even to threaten my life!

294
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,640
Mother!

295
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Your Royal Highness,

296
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Wicked words poison the public.

297
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
[If we don't make a decisive action,]

298
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,400
[and it continues to spread,]

299
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
[it will at least tarnish the reputations]

300
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,720
[of His Highness and Mr. Jin.]

301
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,440
At worst, it could be interpreted by those

302
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
with ill intentions that His Highness

303
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,960
truly has disloyal intentions!

304
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Please issue an immediate decree to

305
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,160
[allow me to arrest all those who attended]

306
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,760
[the banquet at the prince's residence]

307
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,360
for a thorough investigation!

308
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,560
This incident

309
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,760
was caused during the banquet

310
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,720
hosted by Prince Xian.

311
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,680
[Effective immediately,]

312
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,880
Xiao Zhong, the Prince Xian

313
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,640
is to be confined to the residence.

314
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,080
Jin Zang, who composed the music,

315

is to be detained by II for questioning.

The other musicians who performed

317
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,760
at the banquet, are to be thoroughly

318
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,240

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,960
Zang!

351
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,000
Now!

352
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,520
No...

353
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,240
Don't resist!

354
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,000
-No...
-Go!

355
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,120
-Zang!
-Move!

356
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,680
Father!

357
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,840
What's happening?

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,280
How could mother be taken away?

359
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,880
Xing,

360
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,240
your mother has been taken by the

361
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,400
Imperial Inspectorate!

362
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,440
They claim your uncle, Jin Zang, is

363
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,040
involved in Prince Xian's conspiracy,

364
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,920
which endangers the entire family!

365
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,520
How could my uncle, a mere musician,

366
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,920
get involved in a conspiracy?

367
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,720
This is impossible!

368
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,640
This is a frame-up!

369
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,560
Xing,

370
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,600
calm down.

371
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,560
Although Madame Jin has been taken away,

372
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,520
the Yan Family

373
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,240
has not yet been implicated.

374
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,680
[For now, the Imperial Inspectorate]

375
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
[should not be giving you]

376
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,880
[any hard time.]

377
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,320
The Yan Family hasn't been implicated?

378
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,840
Father.

379
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,280
Even though mother's surname is Jin,

380
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,640
she has married into the Yan Family,

381
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,480
making her a Yan.

382
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,280
Even if it implicates

383
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
the Jins, it shouldn't involve her.

384
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,040
The Imperial Inspectorate has no reason

385
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,120
to take her away!

386
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,880
Those men from the Imperial Inspectorate

387
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,920
are just like demons from the underworld.

388
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,480
There's no reasoning with them.

389
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,600
If they want to arrest someone,

390
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,920
they just do it!

391
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Wait!

392
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,480
It's not that they don't reason,

393
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,880
it's that you all

394
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,360
are simply too afraid to reason, right?

395
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Father, my lady,

396
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,640
you let the Imperial Inspectorate

397
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,560
take mother away,

398
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
and you didn't even step up

399
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,800
to question

400
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,680
or intervene,

401
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,480
did you?

402
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Fine!

403
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,280
You all fear the Dark Demon,

404
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,360
but I do not!

405
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,120
I will save her then!

406
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,760
Xing!

407
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,040
Xing!

408
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,400
[Xing!]

409
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,160
Chui?

410
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,040
I finally found you!

411
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,240
Your Lord Shen

412
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,720
sent a message from the palace

413
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,200
through Jing Lin, saying he will

414
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,880
meet with Her Highness

415
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
to plead for the Jin Family.

416
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,240
I split up with poker face to find you.

417
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,000
I knew you must

418
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,320
have returned to the Yan residence.

419
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Chui,

420
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
thank you!

421
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,840
But this involves Prince Xian,

422
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
so the future is uncertain.

423
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,640
Shen Du's help may not be enough.

424
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,640
You should go back,

425
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,680
and I will go talk to Lord Zhang.

426
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,600
Alright.

427
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,800
Be careful!

428
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,400
Poker face, is that you?

429
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,840
[Lai Luozhi...]

430
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Seeing that it's me,

431
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,480
are you disappointed?

432
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,600
I...

433
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,600
I'm expecting Jiang Langxing;

434
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,120
and he will be here shortly.

435
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,000
Jiang Langxing.

436
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,880
Jiang Langxing.

437
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,560
Has he become the sole

438
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,640
focus of your attention?

439
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,520
How good it is when

440
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,960
you're so obedient!

441
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,440
Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice,

442
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,040
Yan Xing, requests to see Lord Zhang!

443
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
Lady Yan,

444
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,600
Lord Zhang is not in the residence today.

445
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,120
After asking around, I've learned

446
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,640
that Lord Zhang has been avoiding visitors

447
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
ever since the Prince Xian incident.

448
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,800
He didn't attend the assembly today.

449
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,760
Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice,

450
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,480
Primary wife of Lord Shen,

451
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,960
the sixth daughter of Erudite, Yan Xing,

452
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,000
requests to see Lord Zhang!

453
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,080
Lady Yan,

454
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,560
please don't make it difficult for us.

455
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm not making it difficult for you.

456
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,160
I'll just stand here and wait.

457
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
I can stand here for a day or two.

458
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,000
He will eventually come out, right?

459
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,760
He wouldn't

460
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,280
avoid me, a woman,

461
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,800
by sneaking out the back door, or even

462
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,480
crawling through a dog hole, would he?

463
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,760
I knew it.

464
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,960
You, Yan Xing,

465
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,560
are not easy to deal with.

466
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,320
If I don't come out,

467
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,520
are you really going to turn

468
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,000
my residence upside down?

469
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,480
I plead with Lord Zhang to save the Jins!

470
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,200
You don't need to plead with me.

471
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,280
As for this matter,

472
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,080
I cannot help you with it.

473
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,160
Lord Zhang,

474
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
you are the Prime Minister,

475
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,200
the head of the state.

476
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,680
The Jins have clearly been wronged;

477
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,920
you cannot ignore this!

478
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,920
Since you have

479
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,600
Her Royal Highness' token,

480
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,920
why did you come to me

481
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,640
instead of going directly to her?

482
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,040
In front of Her Royal Highness,

483
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,760
I am merely an insignificant official

484
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,320
who can chat about trivial matters.

485
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,080
If I mistakenly believe

486
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,920
I can meddle in state affairs,

487
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,800
that would be overestimating myself.

488
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,480
Since you understand this,

489
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,280
why can't you see the reason

490
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,040
Lai Luozhi is using

491
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,720
Mr. Jin as a scapegoat?

492
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,680
Because of me?

493
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,400
The cause of all this

494
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,160
is that you are Shen Du's wife,

495
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,640
[and you are also the one]

496
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,800
[who stirs up trouble everywhere,]

497
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Chief Clerk, Yan Xing.

498
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,760
Of course,

499
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,720
it's not just that.

500
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,200
It is said that

501
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,680
on the night of the winter solstice,

502
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,680
[Lai Luozhi]

503
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,440
[reported to Her Royal Highness, saying]

504
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,360
you were sent to the Shen residence by me

505
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,200
with the intention of winning over Shen Du

506
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,080
and forming factions for personal gain.

507
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,440
[Mr. Jin had the audacity to]

508
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
speak out in court, even challenging

509
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
the authority of Her Highness!

510
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,120
My uncle

511
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,520
argued with Her Highness

512
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,080
for my sake?

513
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,560
According to our imperial laws,

514
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,680
royal servants and musicians are strictly

515
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,720
forbidden from meddling in state affairs.

516
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,000
[Those who defy face the death penalty.]

517
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,720
Jin Zang

518
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,680
relying on his favor, has become arrogant

519
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,640
and overestimates himself.

520
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,800
My uncle wasn't being arrogant.

521
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,560
nor was he overestimating himself.

522
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,480
He acts out of genuine concern for me,

523
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
seeing me as his own flesh and blood.

524
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,640
Even at the risk of his own life,

525
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,320
he wouldn't want to see me suffer!

526
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,320
Xing,

527
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,560
I have often relied on the Yan Family

528
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,280
more than I have cared

529
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,120
for you over the years.

530
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,520
Regarding this matter,

531
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,280
this is about all that I can offer.

532
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,960
When it comes to protecting Prince Xian

533
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,560
and the Jin Family,

534
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,400
I find myself with no choice.

535
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,640
Back then,

536
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,840
regarding the case of the Shen Family,

537
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,320
was it the same kind of choice

538
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,040
you were presented with?

539
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,200
My lord.

540
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,640
Prince Xian has been confined this time,

541
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
yet I have chosen to remain silent.

542
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,680
Do you know why?

543
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
I don't know.

544
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,200
Prince Xian has grown up under my care.

545
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,960
My feelings for him

546
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,720
are akin to Jin Zang's

547
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,160
for Yan Xing.

548
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,080
How could I not wish to dedicate every

549
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,320
last bit of my strength for his sake?

550
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,600
As for this nursery rhyme calamity,

551
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,760
I am fully aware of the situation.

552
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,120
He does not

553
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,960
harbor any intentions of usurpation.

554
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,640
Her Highness is also aware of it for sure.

555
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,240
But Her Highness

556
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,280
is not merely a mother.

557
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,640
She is also the

558
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,240
Empress Dowager of our empire.

559
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,240
If I were to intervene,

560
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,080
my students and colleagues

561
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,400
would all follow suit,

562
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,560
petitioning Her Highness

563
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,080
to release Prince Xian.

564
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,120
The chorus of voices only

565
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,160
pushes Prince Xian closer to ruin.

566
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,080
Chui!

567
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,560
Chui!

568
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,440
What's wrong? Why the urgency?

569
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Has Chui returned?

570
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,840
Didn't she go out

571
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,000
with you earlier?

572
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,560
I split up with her to look for Yan Xing.

573
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,840
Has she not come back yet?

574
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,400
It's possible that after

575
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,120
finding Lady Yan,

576
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,440
they went off to have some fun elsewhere.

577
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,440
Here,

578
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,200
just ask Lady Yan

579
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,080
and you'll find out!

580
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,720
Alright!

581
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,440
You go ask...

582
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
What are you talking about?

583
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,400
Stop bothering her!

584
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,560
What do you mean, my lord?

585
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,760
Lady Yan...

586
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,720
Something serious happened to her family.

587
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,440
You didn't know?

588
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,040
The Jins have been suspected

589
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,200
of inciting Prince Xian to rebel,

590
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,920
and the II has rounded them all up.

591
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,680
By the way,

592
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
even if something major happens,

593
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
don't bother Lady Yan.

594
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,120
You're right, Lord Wu.

595
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,240
I'll go find her myself.

596
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,200
Farewell!

597
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,120
Watch your step!

598
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,720
What is this place?

599
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,400
Everyone calls me the Dark Demon.

600
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,400
So perhaps,

601
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,480
this is the underworld.

602
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
What do you want?

603
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,480
Are you going to kill me?

604
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,920
The eighteen layers of hell

605
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
are reserved for others.

606
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,320
As for you,

607
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,600
even if one day

608
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,880
you truly end up in the underworld,

609
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,920
I'll use the bones as the lamp,

610
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,240
and offer evil spirits as sacrifice,

611
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,000
to illuminate the King Hall of Hell

612
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
and transform it into

613
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,640
a paradise for you.

614
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,240
There's no way to escape.

615
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,720
What's got you so scared?

616
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,160
I...

617
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,960
will not hurt you at all.

618
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,799
Chui.

619
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,279
Raise your head.

620
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,120
Look around you.

621
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,279
What do you think?

622
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,839
Do you like these?

623
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,040
What... is...

624
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,040
Word has it that you're

625
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,280
quite content with the wedding gifts

626
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,480
Jiang Langxing sent.

627
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,960
So these are the things you like.

628
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,920
I bought everything that girls adore

629
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,040
from the market in Xiang'an,

630
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
[as well as all the wedding gifts]

631
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,000
[that wealthy families]

632
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,760
use for betrothal.

633
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,360
What do you think?

634
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,800
What exactly do you want?

635
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,440
I'm here to propose!

636
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,880
Propose?

637
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm asking for your hand in marriage.

638
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,040
May you agree to be my wife.

639
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,080
What are you talking about?

640
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,800
I'm already engaged to Jiang Langxing!

641
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm going to marry him!

642
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,960
That rigid delinquent,

643
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,320
what's so special about him?

644
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,120
What he offers,

645
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,760
I can give you ten times more.

646
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,160
[This isn't about that.]

647
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,760
I've already promised to marry him.

648
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,560
What's so significant about a promise?

649
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,360
Even if you are wed, you can still divorce.

650
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,080
If you feel guilty towards him,

651
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,400
I can make it up to him for you.

652
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,800
As long as he likes,

653
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,720
I could take out Xu Xiangren

654
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,080
and make him the Chief Inspector.

655
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,160
Don't pull any mad stunts!

656
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,920
Alright.

657
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,600
I'll do as you say.

658
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,680
Why can't you see?

659
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,960
Jiang Langxing and I

660
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,680
have genuine feelings for each other.

661
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
We have feelings for each other too!

662
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,760
I like you a lot!

663
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,840
I've never cared for a woman

664
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,080
as deeply as I care for you!

665
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,800
But I don't like you!

666
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,720
That's a lie!

667
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,080
You clearly have feelings for me too!

668
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,560
Didn't you call me maskman

669
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,200
and treat me like a close friend?

670
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,400
Also...

671
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,520
Our mothers

672
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,760
are buried in the same spot.

673
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,560
This is destiny for sure!

674
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,000
The affection between friends

675
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,000
is different from

676
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,320
that of lovers.

677
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,280
I have no such feelings for you!

678
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,680
That's not possible!

679
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,000
It won't be long before

680
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,440
you realize I'm right.

681
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,560
Let go of me!

682
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,120
It's alright.

683
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,120
I'm willing to wait;

684
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
eventually,

685
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,080
you'll fall in love with me.

686
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,960
Stop right there!

687
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
[The case of Jin Family's usurpation is]

688
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,000
entirely under the jurisdiction of Il.

689
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,720
The Ministry of Justice can't interfere.

690
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,640
[Lady Yan,]

691
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,480
[please leave.]

692
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,920
Hold on.

693
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,480
Greetings, my lord.

694
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,760
[Lady Yan,]

695
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
[if you want to save your family,]

696
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,520
[it's actually quite simple.]

697
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,120
You just need to submit a petition

698
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,120
[stating that the Jin Family]

699
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,160
was falsely accused by Shen Du.

700
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,720
Then I can help you overturn the case

701
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,720
and rescue your family.

702
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,360
Lord Lai,

703
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,960
you're deliberately teasing me.

704
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,800
I won't betray my husband

705
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,320
with false charges.

706
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,560
I didn't realize

707
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,720
that the former spy

708
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,600
who married into the Shen Family

709
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,360
[would now be so deeply]

710
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,080
in love with Shen Du.

711
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,120
Lord Lai,

712
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,520
there's no need to

713
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,480
use my past as leverage.

714
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,640
[Regarding this,]

715
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,840
[I have already explained everything to]

716
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,360
[my husband and Lord Zhang.]

717
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,200
My conscience is clear

718
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,200
and have not

719
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,840
wronged anyone.

720
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,320
[I have been diligent in my duties]

721
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,480
[at the Ministry of Justice,]

722
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
committed to uncovering the truth

723
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,840
and clearing the names of the wronged.

724
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,840
Not to mention that Shen Du is my husband,

725
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,920
even if it were anyone else,

726
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,160
I, Yan Xing,

727
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,600
would never do anything

728
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,160
to tarnish my reputation

729
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,840
as a Ministry of Justice official!

730
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,760
Lady Yan, there's no need to be stubborn.

731
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,760
[One day,]

732
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
you will yield to me.

733
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,160
Lady Yan,

734
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,240
please leave.

735
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,320
Please!

736
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,520
Xing.

737
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,600
Welcome back.

738
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,760
Xing,

739
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,240
Her Royal Highness hasn't budged.

740
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,040
I will think of another way.

741
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,920
I already foresaw it.

742
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,200
I went to see Lord Zhang today

743
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,000
and gained some insight

744
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,400
into Her Royal Highness' difficulties.

745
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,920
Even though I don't attend the assembly,

746
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,360
I could envision the situation back then.

747
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,240
If Lai Luozhi succeeds

748
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,720
in framing Prince Xian

749
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,200
with these accusations,

750
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,440
it wouldn't just mean

751
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,160
the annihilation of the Jin Family,

752
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,640
but a complete upheaval in the court.

753
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,320
There would be fierce power struggles.

754
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,440
I can't imagine how many families

755
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,520
would face destruction...

756
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,560
I will find another way.

757
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,040
Tomorrow, the Jin Family

758
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,480
will be put on public display

759
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
by the Imperial Inspectorate.

760
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,040
After that, there may still be hope.
