[Melody of Golden Age]
[EP13]

3
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,240
Only one piece of the cloth

4
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,880
from Jinxiu Shop

5
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,480
at Chen Shoujie's place was found.

6
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
I still need to confirm

7
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,360
which year it's from.

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
You're staying out of this?

9
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,520
Good.

10
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,680
Jing Lin!

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,760
[Yes, Sir.]

12
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,480
I'll have this madwoman imprisoned

13
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,400
in our dungeon right away.

14
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Who told you to take her to the IG?

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,120
Take Lady Yun Que

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,999
to the Shen's residence.

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,320
Lady Yun Que,

18
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,560
please.

19
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,840
[My Lady,]

20
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
[a maid from the Shen's is here.]

21
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,320
He?

22
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,240
Ma'am,

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,600
please come home and see for yourself.

24
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,920
As soon as Mr Shen left this morning,

25
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,520
[Yun Que became a different person.]

26
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,880
We need you. Or things will get outta hand.

27
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,080
Put this ceramic vase

28
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,760
over there.

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,240
Clean

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
[the lantern over there.]

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
My Lady, look at her.

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,240
She's been ordering

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
the whole residence around all day.

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,880
[She mistook someone else for Mr Shen.]

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
[Mr Shen took her in]

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,240
[out of pity.]

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
But she really

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
thinks she's the lady of the house now.

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,160
[They need]

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
[to match the Shen's residence.]

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,520
You should go out and see more.

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,920
[So you'll know better]

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,160
[when you go make cushions.]

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,320
Have you cleared the grass in the backyard

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,760
[or cleaned the book shelf]

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
as asked?

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,720
Then what are you waiting for?

48
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,280
I asked them to set up the front hall.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
It's not important, huh?

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
Lady Yun Que,

51
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,680
it's not like that.

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,560
You're being too harsh.

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
When you assign tasks to the servants,

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
they should naturally do them well.

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,280
However,

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Mr Shen will pay us.

57
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
We should work for him.

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,160
I mean,

59
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,160
we must prioritize the tasks

60
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,480
he's arranged.

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
Don't you think so?

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
Then I'll do the decorations tomorrow.

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,600
[Sir,]

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
[please sort out the household accounts]

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,160
[and bring them to me.]

66
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,480
I'll take a look.

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,880
[Only the lady of the house]

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,160
can do that.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,560
My Lady,

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,520
good morning.

72
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,400
Sir,

73
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,680
why are you...

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,440
My Lady,

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,720
I forgot to greet you this morning.

76
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm really sorry.

77
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Please punish me.

78
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
Punish?

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,080
The rules say that

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,520
all the servants

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080
must greet you in the morning and evening.

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,120
The female members should

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,600
serve tea to you.

84
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,280
[Since my first day here,]

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,840
[I've kept this in mind.]

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,440
Rudeness is absolutely intolerable.

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,040
I apologize for my disrespect.

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,560
Even if you

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,880
kick me out,

90
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,560
I won't have any complaints.

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Enough, enough.

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,160
[All you want]

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880
is for me to serve tea

94
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
to Mrs Shen.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,960
I'll just do it.

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Ma'am,

97
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,560
have some tea.

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,640
Well,

99
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,760
you've had the tea,

100
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
and we've been through the rules.

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Let's talk about reasons.

102
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
Mr Shen asked me

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,480
to oversee the household affairs.

104
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,560
I naturally need to do my best.

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Or maybe,

106
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,440
you wish to go against

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,880
his decision?

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,000
You just mentioned

109
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,720
the accounts, right?

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,280
Yeah.

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
Since you wanna have a look,

112
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,760
why not

113
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,640
take it over for the next season as well?

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,720
But...

115
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
[My Lady...]

116
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,200
You mean

117
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,000
all the accounts will be managed by me?

118
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
I wasn't very good

119
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
at it anyway.

120
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,080
Since you're willing to take on some of

121
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,320
the burdens, I can only be happy.

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,400
My Lady.

123
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,280
Sir,

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,440
please bring them

125
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,640
to Lady Yun Que.

126
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,760
I've been busy with official duties,

127
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,880
so Lady Yun Que will make

128
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,960
all decisions on the household matters.

129
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Then,

130
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
we'll count on you.

131
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,640
[My Lady,]

132
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
[please think it through.]

133
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,960
[Mr Shen was just temporarily misled.]

134
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,840
[That temptress must]

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,400
[have used some tricks]

136
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,600
to deceive him

137
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,920
[into bringing her here.]

138
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
Don't worry.

139
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,120
There's only one first lady

140
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,280
[in his heart.]

141
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,440
[All of us are also]

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
on your side.

143
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
Sir,

144
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
it really has nothing to do

145
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,320
with Yun Que.

146
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
My Lady,

147
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,280
please don't take me as a fool.

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,400
If you're not angry at her,

149
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,320
why would you

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,600
move back to your family home?

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,320
Family home? No!

152
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
I'm busy with the investigation

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,120
and probably need to stay up late

154
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,840
at the Ministry of Justice.

155
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,240
So I won't be living here for a while.

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't worry.

157
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,960
I should go now.

158
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
How... can this be? Truly.

159
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,880
Cut to the chase.

160
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Sir,

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,440
when you're these days,

162
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,520
Lady Yun Que

163
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
kept messing around

164
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
with the servants at home.

165
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Chamberlain Shen can't bear her anymore.

166
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
He even gave me an ultimatum today,

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,200
saying that if I failed to

168
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,520
bring you and Her Lady back,

169
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,400
I wouldn't be allowed to go back.

170
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
When did he

171
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,840
become so close to Yan Xing?

172
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,600
Sir,

173
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,640
could you please clarify things for me?

174
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
At first, I thought you

175
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
liked Lady Yun Que.

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,120
But ever since

177
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,720
you brought her back to the residence,

178
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,400
you've never gone back there.

179
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
So,

180
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,480
which side should I be on?

181
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,200
Looks like you have a lot of free time.

182
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,560
You have the time to worry about

183
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
my family affairs?

184
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,720
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Get up.

186
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,760
How is the security setup

187
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,920
for the next few days?

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,879
My Lord,

189
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
it's all ready.

190
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,920
The security for the Secretary's

191
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,759
Office has now been

192
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,960
fully taken over by the IG.

193
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
[The former guards]

194
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
[have been reassigned to aid]

195
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,600
[the Delinquents at the Imperial Academy.]

196
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,000
Jiang Langxing is over there.

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,600
Perfect.

198
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,880
Let's finish this quickly and go home.

199
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,600
Jiang Langxing.

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
[Candidates must not talk to each other.]

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
Mr Xu asked us to bring you a message.

202
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Listen carefully.

203
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,200
The latest directives from above

204
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,840
stress again the importance of this exam.

205
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,280
[It must be secured so thoroughly]

206
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,680
[that nothing can get in or out,]

207
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,840
not even a fly.

208
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,720
Did you get it?

209
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,680
You... You spoke too fast.

210
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,880
I didn't get everything.

211
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
Chuichui,

212
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
slow down a bit.

213
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,440
Plus,

214
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,240
hasn't Mr Xu instructed us

215
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,200
to inspect more carefully

216
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,800
to ensure that

217
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
there are no security oversights?

218
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
We also need to inspect?

219
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,400
Sorry,

220
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
but how about coming with me inside?

221
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,760
We've set up checkpoints

222
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,280
at various doors and courtyards.

223
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,240
Chuichui,

224
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,200
why don't the two of you go in first?

225
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
I'll wait for

226
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
my brother here.

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,840
That's right.

228
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,280
He passed the preliminary test as well.

229
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Alright.

230
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,960
- Go ahead.
- Then I'll go in then.

231
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Jiang Langxing,

232
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,320
let's go.

233
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,680
[It's not easy being a matchmaker.]

234
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,320
Excuse me,

235
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,960
could you

236
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
help me find someone?

237
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
Pan Chi.

238
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,520
[The man you are looking for]

239
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,600
is indeed on the list for the final exam.

240
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
[But until now, he still]

241
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,040
[hasn't registered for the exam yet.]

242
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,960
Chi,

243
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,400
did you really give up?

244
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,360
[Who said I gave up?]

245
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Chi!

246
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,400
It's really you!

247
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,440
You came to the exam!

248
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,640
That day,

249
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,680
after I sobered up,

250
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,240
I thought about what you said to me.

251
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,800
Finally the Imperial Academy

252
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,240
is open to all,

253
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,960
with my incredible talent,

254
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,760
I must impress

255
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,280
those antiquated scholars

256
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,720
and show them

257
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,640
what a truly great piece of writing is.

258
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
Congratulations.

259
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Then I wish you great success

260
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
and get into the Imperial Academy.

261
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
Since you are named Pan Chi,

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,600
like the renowned detective,

263
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
you must be just as talented.

264
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,320
Today,

265
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,360
you look particularly radiant.

266
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Of course.

267
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
With just a little effort,

268
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,560
I will surely be captivating,

269
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,600
the most dashing in Xiang'an.

270
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
But jokes aside,

271
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,320
you don't look too well.

272
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Did you drink again these days?

273
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
These days I've been

274
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
busy looking through records for the case,

275
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
but

276
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,680
I've got nothing.

277
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,560
Is the case you're talking about

278
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,680
that case

279
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,000
about the moth or something?

280
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,200
You know about it?

281
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Of course I know about it.

282
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,640
The whole city knows about it.

283
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,960
It's becoming legendary.

284
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,360
But I think,

285
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,360
you shouldn't only look at records.

286
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
You need to ask around some more.

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I've asked everyone involved.

288
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,520
One of them

289
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,360
died,

290
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
the other one went mad.

291
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,400
So what?

292
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,320
In our line of work,

293
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,040
we're least afraid of dealing with bodies.

294
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,760
The bodies

295
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,240
can tell you a lot of things.

296
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,320
Plus,

297
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,640
even a madman's words

298
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,400
are not all necessarily nonsense.

299
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,240
[This is]

300
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,960
[Father's writing before he got hurt.]

301
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,120
[When Lord Shen was young,]

302
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,680
his writing was as sharp

303
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
and vigorous as a sword.

304
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
But later on,

305
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,440
his writing became

306
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,200
more refined,

307
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,560
more classic and smooth.

308
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,320
[It took me a long time]

309
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,480
[to be able to]

310
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,600
[write just like he did.]

311
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
[So it was forged.]

312
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,640
[But if it was Erudite Yan, who knew]

313
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,800
[Father's writing well, that framed him,]

314
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
[he wouldn't have]

315
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
[used the wrong brush technique.]

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,040
[Someone else]

317
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,520
[must have forged it.]

318
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,720
Chi,

319
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,680
thank you.

320
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,760
Your suggestion has helped

321
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,720
me come up with a different approach.

322
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
Me?

323
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,880
I didn't give you any suggestions.

324
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,400
C'mon, there you are, my darling.

325
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,360
Why aren't you at the Ministry of Justice

326
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,640
but chatting here?

327
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,560
Sir,

328
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,960
I'm here on official business.

329
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,280
You only need to focus on

330
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,560
the IG's affairs.

331
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,480
My whereabouts everyday

332
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,880
is none of your business.

333
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,720
I don't care about your business.

334
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,080
But what if it's about

335
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,760
your family duties?

336
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
The house is in chaos.

337
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
As my wife,

338
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,480
you should go back and handle it.

339
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,160
Let's go back.

340
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
Are you dreaming of

341
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,320
being on equal footing with Her Lady

342
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,440
and serving the same husband?

343
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,840
[Let me tell you,]

344
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,960
as long as I'm still alive,

345
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,560
don't even think about marrying into.

346
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,000
That's not up to you.

347
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,280
Listen,

348
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,520
give me the accounts.

349
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,320
Greetings, Mr and Mrs Shen.

350
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,080
My Lord,

351
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,760
you brought Her Lady back.

352
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,320
[As the saying goes,]

353
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,040
[couples that argue but then make up]

354
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,480
will stay together for life.

355
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
Sir,

356
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm a bit hungry.

357
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,920
Could you check

358
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,520
the dinner?

359
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,680
Okay.

360
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,520
Right away.

361
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Lady Yun Que,

362
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,240
stop arguing with Chamberlain Shen.

363
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,360
Don't worry.

364
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,240
On our first day of marriage,

365
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,840
we agreed to divorce

366
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,920
in the future.

367
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,680
Sooner or later,

368
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,040
you'll be in charge of the accounts.

369
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,280
Divorce?

370
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
A good man like Mr Shen,

371
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,960
why don't you cherish him?

372
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
[He's exceptionally talented]

373
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,040
[and strikingly good-looking.]

374
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
[Whoever can't see that]

375
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,360
must be blind.

376
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,280
It's a pity that such a good girl

377
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,280
doesn't have good eyesight.

378
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
[What are you laughing at?]

379
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,000
Is it that

380
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,080
you think Mr Shen is ugly?

381
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,880
No, no, no.

382
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,160
Lady Yun Que,

383
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,160
one ought to think

384
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,240
before talking.

385
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,960
I don't think we're

386
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,920
needed here.

387
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
Let's leave soon.

388
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,240
Don't drag me.

389
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,400
Then walk yourself.

390
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,560
Come live here again.

391
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
After all,

392
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,040
we...

393
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,120
I know.

394
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,240
[I'm not the one you want.]

395
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,320
If others find out,

396
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,360
it will only result in more rumors.

397
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,560
After the case is closed,

398
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,680
I will move back.

399
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,320
I won't get you into trouble.

400
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,760
[The Great Grandmother]

401
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,800
[has picked the final exam topic.]

402
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
[We open it by her order.]

403
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,920
[The topic is]

404
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,760
[to immerse in the grand scenery]

405
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,120
[and thriving Xiang'an.]

406
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,880
[No restrictions on literary form.]

407
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
[Poetry and essays are preferred.]

408
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,880
Remove him.

409
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,400
Your Highness,

410
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,440
we've reviewed the papers for 3 days

411
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,880
and finalized the list of candidates

412
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,600
[for admission to the Imperial Academy.]

413
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,680
[Please review the list.]

414
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,720
The papers are placed by score.

415
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,360
[The first]

416
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,840
[is from Cheng Bojian,]

417
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,320
[this year's top scorer.]

418
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
[So Pan Chi]

419
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,440
got the last place.

420
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,200
Yes.

421
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,440
Wan,

422
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,520
read the last-placed essay

423
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,920
[to me.]

424
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,880
Tall pines at the foot of the mountain,

425
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
[short saplings at the summit.]

426
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,040
[That's why even the short saplings]

427
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,560
can overshadow the hundred-foot pines.

428
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,000
In my opinion,

429
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
the last-placed one shows

430
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,520
impressive literary skill.

431
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Pan Chi's work

432
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,840
didn't fall short in literary talent,

433
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,880
[but]

434
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,520
was somewhat off-topic.

435
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't really understand

436
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,960
what you meant.

437
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,040
Wan,

438
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,000
why don't you explain it to me?

439
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,360
He compares the tall pine trees

440
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,720
at the foot of mountains

441
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
to the scholars with humble backgrounds,

442
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,720
[and the short saplings on the top]

443
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
[as the sons of noble families.]

444
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
[Because of high-born status,]

445
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,120
even the short saplings

446
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,640
can still overshadow the tallest pines.

447
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,760
I think

448
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,080
the description of the scenery

449
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,600
is quite amazing.

450
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,960
Go on.

451
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I laugh loudly toward the sky.

452
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,320
[Striding across the divine realm.]

453
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,160
[The noble may think themselves noble,]

454
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,200
[but I see them as mere dust.]

455
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,240
[The humble may think themselves lowly,]

456
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
[who says they don't carry great weight?]

457
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,840
[I gaze at the mountains]

458
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,800
[and dip my feet into the long river.]

459
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,440
[Not only will I take the exam,]

460
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,760
I'll also expose

461
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,240
your hideous face!

462
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,240
I can tell your mind

463
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
isn't on the chessboard at all.

464
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,560
Do you want to ask me why,

465
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,800
[though I saw the corruption in]

466
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,520
the Imperial Academy's selection process,

467
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
I still approved

468
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,080
the original list?

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,560
I did want to ask you.

470
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,040
But then I understood.

471
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,200
Though Pan Chi is brilliant in literary,

472
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,040
he is too impulsive.

473
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,080
So,

474
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,640
he's not suitable to be a court official.

475
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
This exam

476
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,760
was just an experiment.

477
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,400
[The selection process]

478
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,160
[has long been corrupted.]

479
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
Many court officials

480
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,560
were involved.

481
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
It has become a well-defended

482
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,280
stalemate.

483
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,560
Even if I want to make a move in this game,

484
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
I have to

485
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,120
find the right time to place my piece.

486
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,040
[I gaze at the mountains]

487
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,800
[and dip my feet into the long river.]

488
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,680
What grand and magnificent writing!

489
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
It uses scenery to mock current affairs,

490
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,360
implying that someone

491
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,240
under the guise of

492
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,720
fair selection

493
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,640
are suppressing the commoners

494
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,080
to solidify the power of noble families.

495
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,160
How gratifying!

496
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,040
Okay now.

497
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
You've been praising this friend of yours

498
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,440
non-stop.

499
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,800
But he does write very well.

500
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,680
Chi

501
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,520
shares

502
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,440
a name with the greatest detective.

503
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,880
He may be

504
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
the detective himself.

505
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
It's almost certain.

506
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,080
Ms Yan.

507
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,960
Mr Xu asked me to tell you

508
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,040
[that he's got a lead on]

509
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,280
[Chen Shoujie's background report]

510
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,160
[that you're interested in.]

511
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,080
Chen Shoujie was indeed

512
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,960
involved in Chen Huo'e case

513
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,800
[and was even promoted for it.]

514
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,520
Only that, he went mad

515
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
shortly after his promotion.

516
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,200
So he already went mad

517
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,640
before Mrs Chen died.

518
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,200
We must have missed something

519
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
between him

520
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,360
and the fire moth case.

521
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,440
Looks like

522
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,400
I need to go to the Chen residence again.

523
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,800
Shen Du.

524
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,760
Are you okay?

525
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,480
Watch out!

526
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
[The form is different from that day,]

527
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,600
[the way the hidden weapon was used is]

528
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,880
[remarkably similar.]

529
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
You're hurt.

530
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,840
It's nothing.

531
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Just a small cut.

532
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,080
Why did you come here alone?

533
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,240
I came to find someone but he's not here.

534
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,920
You're bleeding a lot.

535
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,400
How can you be fine?

536
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,400
Are you worried about me?

537
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,880
I'm not worried about you.

538
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,800
You got hurt because you were saving me.

539
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,080
I need to be responsible for you.

540
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,360
Father must be really out of it.

541
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
The shop is closed.

542
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,400
Yet he insisted that I go check

543
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,040
if there's been any thefts.

544
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
Where do you think you're going?

545
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,400
I advise you not to make more mistakes.

546
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm a clerk at the Ministry of Justice.

547
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,840
If you turn yourself in,

548
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
you may get a lighter sentence for theft.

549
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,520
But if you hurt me,

550
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,280
that would be a serious offense.

551
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,480
You meddlesome woman.

552
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,640
Die!

553
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,120
Help!

554
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,280
It's you.

555
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,080
[Who's there?]

556
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,360
Wait.

557
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,200
Wait a second.

558
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Wait.

559
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,280
It were

560
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
the Delinquents

561
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
who were patrolling.

562
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,040
Why do we need to hide?

563
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,720
I...

564
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,200
Don't want to deal with the officials.

565
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,640
You avoid

566
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,440
dealing with the officials,

567
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,520
and you are skilled in martial arts.

568
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
I know who you are.

569
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,320
You must be

570
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,480
a vigilante hero against injustice, right?

571
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,320
You put on the mask at night

572
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,000
and become a warrior for justice.

573
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,720
[You uphold justice and]

574
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,840
do good deeds without seeking recognition.

575
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,720
Kind of.

576
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,440
Wait.

577
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,600
You can't leave.

578
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,800
You killed someone.

579
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,520
What?

580
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
Are you arresting me?

581
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,880
I killed the man who wanted to kill you.

582
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,800
This is how you treat

583
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,680
your savior?

584
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,600
According to our laws,

585
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,240
anyone who kills the perpetrator

586
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,160
facing unjustified night violence

587
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,960
won't be held accountable.

588
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,240
But,

589
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,360
you can't

590
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,840
just leave like this.

591
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,520
What are you doing?

592
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,400
To release a water lantern for you.

593
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,200
When I was little,

594
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,760
my mother often

595
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,680
brought me here to release water lanterns.

596
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,720
[My mother said]

597
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,600
that water lanterns can float away,

598
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,640
carrying away misfortunes and illnesses,

599
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,920
and can

600
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,240
[take away]

601
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,360
all bad things.

602
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,720
Even though you killed to protect me,

603
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,320
it's still better

604
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,720
to release a water lantern

605
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,480
to clear away any bad karma from killing.

606
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,360
No need.

607
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,360
I don't believe in these things.

608
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,720
If you believe it, then it will work.

609
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,200
I didn't believe it as a kid either.

610
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
So I was always half-hearted doing it.

611
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,960
And then,

612
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,440
my mother grew sicker and sicker

613
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,360
and eventually left me.

614
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,760
I often wonder,

615
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,760
if back then,

616
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
I had released every

617
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,520
every water lantern sincerely,

618
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,160
would the heavens

619
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,200
make my wish come true

620
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,840
and let my mother always be here with me.

621
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,160
Even if you release 1000 water lanterns,

622
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,680
people would still leave.

623
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,080
In this life,

624
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,240
they've already decided that

625
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,960
they would stay with us only this long.

626
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,760
You can't change that.

627
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,160
You can't change nothing at all.

628
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,200
Ghostface.

629
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,800
My Lord,

630
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
the thief hanged himself in the alley.

631
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
We can't find out who he was.

632
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,640
He hanged himself?

633
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
If they wanted to kill him,

634
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,920
of course they won't let us

635
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,120
find out who he was.

636
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,400
You're dismissed.

637
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:24,920
Yes.

638
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,440
Sir,

639
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,320
do you really not need a doctor

640
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,120
[or some medication?]

641
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,880
Mind your own business.

642
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,880
No need.

643
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,720
[Who said there's no need?]

644
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,400
I'll apply some medication for you.

645
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,040
Do you have other things to do later?

646
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,560
You seem so rushed.

647
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,320
It can't be that you're off to rest, right?

648
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,360
Of course not.

649
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,360
I was thinking,

650
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,600
if after treating you

651
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,880
it's still not too late,

652
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,800
I can go to the Ministry of Justice

653
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
and organize the case details.

654
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,280
The case is this pressing that

655
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,400
you can't rest even at night?

656
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,600
I was just hoping to

657
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,880
solve it sooner.

658
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,040
Staying up is nothing.

659
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,800
But I'm hurt.

660
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,200
Can't you stay here

661
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,000
and take care of me tonight?

662
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,320
I... I...

663
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,640
Forget it.

664
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
I don't need you to take care of me.

665
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,800
Go ahead.

666
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,760
Let me do it.

667
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,160
Who said I was leaving?

668
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,400
You got hurt because you were saving me.

669
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,720
If I leave now,

670
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,800
the heavens would think

671
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,720
I have no conscience.

672
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,360
And what if it

673
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,280
sends a lightning to strike me,

674
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,600
wouldn't I be wrongly punished?

675
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,520
You must have pulled on my wound.

676
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,600
Don't get distracted.

677
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,720
Treat the wound well.

678
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,680
Sure, sure.

679
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,640
Perhaps

680
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,400
I didn't bandage it well earlier.

681
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Now it's better.

682
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
It's getting late.

683
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
You should get some rest.

684
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,960
My Lord.

685
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,480
My Lord.

686
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,040
My Lord, please spare my life.

687
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,400
I have found out that

688
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,320
the Delinquents are treating this

689
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,600
as a typical case of thieves fighting

690
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,200
among themselves and didn't

691
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,400
report it to the Ministry of Justice.

692
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,560
Useless!

693
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,120
Send someone more competent next time.

694
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,240
If it goes wrong again,

695
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,120
you'll be the next one to die.

696
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,720
[I've learnt my lesson.]

697
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,000
Thank you for sparing my life.

698
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,120
Lu Chuichui at the Ministry of Justice.

699
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,960
No one touches her.

700
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,240
Yes.

701
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,080
You're dismissed.

702
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,760
[A bunch of ignorant fools.]

703
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,200
[A simple fire moth trick]

704
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,320
[can cause such chaos.]

705
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,720
[Before long,]

706
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,720
[the empire...]

707
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
You should get up now.

708
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,920
Go eat something in the front hall.

709
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,560
People need to eat more

710
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,000
when they're hurt.

711
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,760
You saw it yourself.

712
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm badly hurt.

713
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
[I can't move.]

714
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,600
It's too hard to go to the front hall.

715
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,920
I only want to lie down.

716
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,600
Fine.

717
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,920
Then get some rest.

718
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,680
I'll

719
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,280
bring you some breakfast later.

720
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,480
What?

721
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,720
Where's Yan Xing?

722
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,960
She's invited

723
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,640
by the Yans to a banquet.

724
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,560
[She instructed that you're badly hurt]

725
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,920
[and don't need to go there with her.]

726
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,320
I...

727
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,280
[She asked us to serve you food.]

728
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,160
You're dismissed.

729
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,640
Yes.

730
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,640
Sir, I...

731
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,400
What?

732
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,280
I found it.

733
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,640
Han Shiyuan

734
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,880
is not what he seems.

735
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,600
Xing,

736
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,800
Shiyuan and I

737
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,360
are engaged to be married next month.

738
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,240
I'll use tea as wine

739
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,280
to toast to you and Shiyuan and

740
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,040
wish you a lifetime of happiness together.

741
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,320
I ask for your forgiveness

742
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,520
if I had been

743
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,720
rude and inconsiderate before.

744
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,360
[No need, no need.]

745
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,320
Okay then.

746
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,640
Sit down first and talk.

747
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,640
Our family has been blessed with

748
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,160
a series of joyful events this year.

749
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,200
Mojie got into the Imperial Academy,

750
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,200
Xing and Caiwei

751
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,040
[both married well.]

752
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,120
Xing,

753
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,280
why did you often come back here recently?

754
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,480
Did you have a fight

755
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,600
with your husband?

756
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,040
No, no.

757
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,600
I'm doing well there.

758
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,040
But a few days ago,

759
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,000
the cook

760
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,600
has taken a few days off to go home.

761
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,240
[So I couldn't eat well there.]

762
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,920
I'm just here for the food.

763
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,160
That's good then.

764
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,760
The rumors say that

765
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,040
as soon as you're back home,

766
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,440
Chief Shen would come here to take you.

767
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,720
This situation

768
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,760
[is indeed a bit terrifying.]

769
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
[When you came back last time]

770
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,560
[and he didn't come to take you,]

771
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,600
I was feeling even more uneasy.

772
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
My Lord, My Lady,

773
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,440
Chief Shen is here.

774
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,360
Greetings.

775
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,600
Please take a seat.

776
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,400
Weren't you having difficulty moving?

777
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,960
I can't miss my father-in-law's

778
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,320
family banquet.

779
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,240
That's right.

780
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,960
This way,

781
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,160
please.
