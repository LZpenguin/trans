[Melody of Golden Age]
[EP11]

3
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
Xing!

4
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,120
Where do I start with you?

5
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
What you just expressed,

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,440
your loyalty to the Ministry of Justice,

7
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,000
is as clear as day.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
It's truly moving.

9
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,160
But saying such things to Lord Lai

10
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,600
is really not a good idea!

11
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
[He is, after all,]

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
the Dark Demon!

13
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,280
My Lord!

14
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,720
Indeed, Xing!

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
My heart is still racing.

16
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
Do you really believe you

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,120
are literally a she-devil?

18
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,119
You know...

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,719
That Dark Demon is someone

20
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,560
who can really rip out real

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
devils or demons' hearts

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
and eat them raw!

23
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,400
What's the point

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,960
[of getting under his skin?]

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
[Princess Ying has arrived.]

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
With your intelligence and skills,

28
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
you're adept at both detective work

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,520
and household management.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,840
You're indeed

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,960
a rare female talent.

32
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,080
We promote the participation of

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,000
women in governance.

34
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,760
As the wife of Mr Yan,

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,920
you are a paragon of this vision.

36
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,600
Gratitude, Your Highness.

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
May I ask what brings

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
you here today?

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,720
Last night, Chen Huo'e returned from the dead.

40
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,600
This morning,

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,280
Lord Lai approached Her Highness

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,360
to request the authority to investigate.

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,120
This case is entangled and complex.

44
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
I imagine the Ministry of Justice

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,920
would not want to get involved, right?

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
It's originally

47
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,560
handled by the IG.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,600
But it's been taken over by Lord Lai.

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,840
We have no authority to intervene,

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,800
nor do we dare to do it.

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,920
However, Yan Xing,

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,480
besides being a clerk in the Ministry,

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,720
is also the wife of Lord Commander.

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,080
I heard you're so good

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,640
at managing your husband.

56
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,440
If you could

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,240
persuade him not to

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
get involved in this case,

59
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,680
and manage to suppress your curiosity

60
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,840
to stay out of it,

61
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,960
I would be very willing

62
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,159
to help you

63
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,280
personally go to Her Royal Highness

64
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,240
to request a decree for marriage,

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,120
so that your sister and Han Shiyuan

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,320
can be together.

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,160
I am quite busy.

68
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,160
Don't make me wait for you too long.

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
Is that alright?

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,520
Xing!

71
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,360
Yan Xing.

72
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
You originally had nothing

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
to do with that case.

74
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,120
All you need to do is

75
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,160
to persuade Lord Commander.

76
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,680
Then your family can receive

77
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,040
2 marriage decrees granted

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,000
by Her Royal Highness.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,040
How glorious

80
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,320
and prestigious is that!

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,680
What were you hesitating for?

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,360
Why didn't you

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,600
agree immediately earlier?

84
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,480
[Princess Ying and Lord Lai]

85
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,640
clearly don't want Imperial Guard and

86
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,560
the Ministry of Justice involved.

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
But the more they act this way,

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,640
the more it shows their guilt, doesn't it?

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
Moreover, logically speaking,

90
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,440
Princess Ying

91
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
has just escaped from the suspicion

92
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
of the weeping statue case.

93
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,800
Why would she rush to

94
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240
stir up the hornet's nest?

95
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,120
Xing!

96
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,760
This case is clearly a tangled web.

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,520
You should be avoiding it.

98
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,520
You wouldn't want to get involved, right?

99
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Chui!

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
Yan Xing! You lousy little...

101
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,280
You are Lord Commander's wife.

102
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,720
I can't control what risks you take.

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,240
But you must not

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,680
link this case to us

105
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,440
in any way.

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,800
The Ministry of Justice

107
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,600
will not accompany you to your grave!

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,520
My Lord,

109
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,680
Lord Zhang Baohuan,

110
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,160
a confidant of Her Royal Highness

111
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,320
is currently outside our ministry.

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,520
He asked

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,640
Lady Yan to join him for a chat.

114
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,280
Dear heavenly nymph!

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
[Please stop bringing all these]

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,480
[mighty and influential figures]

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,920
to my humble ministry!

118
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Lady Yan.

119
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,440
Your schedule seems full.

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,440
Today Baohuan came for a chat.

121
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,320
I hope this is not an intrusion.

122
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm truly humbled.

123
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,200
I came today,

124
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
not to ask anything major,

125
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,240
but just to inquire

126
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,120
about Han Shiyuan's recent situation.

127
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Is he doing well?

128
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,840
Last night, he returned to the

129
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,960
Yan residence with my sister.

130
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,000
Imperial Guard didn't give him a hard time.

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
I went to the Yan residence today,

132
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,760
but was told he was not there.

133
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,320
It seems he

134
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
still doesn't want to see me, right?

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,640
If I may, can I inquire about

136
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,320
your shared history?

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
He is just

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,840
an old acquaintance.

139
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Since he has won the favor

140
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
of the Yan Family's third daughter,

141
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,920
that is indeed his fortune.

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,880
In the future, I would be

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
grateful if you could extend your care

144
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,880
to him within your household.

145
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Certainly.

146
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:58,920
Then,

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
Baohuan will not disturb you any longer.

148
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,320
I will take my leave now.

149
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
[Han Shiyuan is very secretive about]

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,440
[his relationship with Zhang Baohuan]

151
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,560
[and Princess Ying.]

152
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,560
[Behind Chen Huo'e's resurrection,]

153
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,600
[there seem to be many parties involved.]

154
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
[It even seems to involve]

155
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,360
[Caiwei's marriage.]

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,000
[Even Lai Luozhi wants to intervene.]

157
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
[Now,]

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,000
[it seems everyone hopes]

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,520
[that I could stay out of it.]

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,360
[What should I do?]

161
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,840
Xing, you've come.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Greetings, Caiwei,

163
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Mr. Han.

164
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,600
We are indebted to you and Lord Commander

165
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,680
for your rescue last night.

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,320
Why did you send gifts to us?

167
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,520
Lady Yan

168
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,400
must be here to interrogate us, right?

169
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,440
About last night,

170
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,080
the two of us

171
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
really know nothing.

172
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,440
Caiwei, rest assured.

173
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
The truth of last night's incident

174
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
will definitely come to light.

175
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm just here to ask

176
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,320
Mr. Han.

177
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,360
What is your relationship with Lord Zhang

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,440
and Princess Ying?

179
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,080
There is nothing I can reveal.

180
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,480
Even now,

181
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,520
you keep it concealed.

182
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,480
If it weren't for you,

183
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
how would my sister

184
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,320
have suffered so much?

185
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,160
Don't pressure him anymore.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,880
I trust him.

187
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,000
Xing, welcome home.

188
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,240
Mother.

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
Aren't you on duty today?

190
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,760
You must be worried about those gifts.

191
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,520
So you're here

192
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,560
to check them,

193
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,320
right?

194
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,920
You know,

195
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,520
your husband

196
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
has handled the matter with grace,

197
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,760
even bringing

198
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,320
honor to me.

199
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
Gifts?

200
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,200
Caiwei also mentioned gifts earlier.

201
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,960
What exactly are you all talking about?

202
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,160
Don't you know?

203
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,680
This morning, the Shens sent someone over,

204
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
saying you were worried about your sister

205
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,720
being frightened last night,

206
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,360
and specially sent

207
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,320
a whole bunch of nourishing supplements.

208
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,280
When I saw how generous they were,

209
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,880
I knew

210
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,080
it must be from my son-in-law.

211
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,560
By the way, the kitchen

212
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,800
is stewing some nourishing soup.

213
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,360
Come,

214
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,520
let me get some for you.

215
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
Shen Du?

216
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,080
He actually did all this behind my back.

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,160
Why has he suddenly become

218
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,280
so warm towards my family?

219
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,320
Isn't that obvious?

220
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,000
It's all thanks to you!

221
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,160
Otherwise, how would Lord Commander

222
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,520
care about our insignificant Yan Family?

223
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,200
That bastard!

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,600
He wouldn't still be harboring

225
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,160
feelings for Caiwei, would he?

226
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
Your sister is celebrated

227
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,200
as a gifted maiden in Xiang'an!

228
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
She does seem more

229
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,880
appealing than you.

230
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,760
No, no, no!

231
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,880
This trend

232
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,320
must be nipped in the bud.

233
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,840
Tonight, I will urge your father

234
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,680
to arrange the marriage

235
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,040
between Caiwei and Han Shiyuan.

236
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,400
We need to make sure they

237
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,520
get married as soon as possible.

238
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,280
Mother!

239
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,280
Exactly what's going on

240
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,680
in your mind?

241
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,520
Did White Death

242
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,080
beat you up lately?

243
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,200
Have you two been arguing recently?

244
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
You have to know,

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,800
you must not let your guard down.

246
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,520
You need to keep

247
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
a close watch on him.

248
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,680
OK, mother, I understand.

249
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,080
I am a bit hungry.

250
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,000
Why don't you go get me some soup?

251
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,520
I almost forgot about it.

252
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Just wait a moment.

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,600
Quite an exquisite pipa.

254
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,520
Lovely melody.

255
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,680
What a beautiful sentiment.

256
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,120
Today, the piece played

257
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
seems different from before.

258
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
It has a touch of Zen.

259
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,560
Listening to it is refreshing.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,640
This is an ancient masterpiece

261
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,320
sought by Lady Xu.

262
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,600
A few days ago, when I went to the temple,

263
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,480
I received the score from an eminent monk.

264
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,760
It's said to have an enlightening effect.

265
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,560
So I asked Mr. Jin

266
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,600
to play it for you.

267
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,160
Indeed, it is wonderful.

268
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,040
Back in the day,

269
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,320
you personally

270
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,320
went up the mountain to dig rare

271
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
mushrooms for me,

272
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,440
asking me to go easy on

273
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,240
the Shens

274
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,160
and release Shen Du from custody.

275
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,320
Then,

276
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,080
what is your request today?

277
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,360
I am truly humbled.

278
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,120
He may enter now.

279
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,680
Mr Shen.

280
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,160
I know why you're here.

281
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Lord Lai has requested

282
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,520
to lead the Chen Huo'e investigation.

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,760
The case

284
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
has been handled by you recently.

285
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,000
But it's previously under

286
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,600
his supervision 5 years ago.

287
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,560
He admitted that he's failed in his duties.

288
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,920
It is only natural for him

289
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
to demand compensation.

290
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,000
Your Highness,

291
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,320
I believe,

292
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,160
once a person dies, they die for good.

293
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,360
The Chen Huo'e from back then

294
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,280
may not be the same as the one of today.

295
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,080
Lord Shen,

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,200
since you are unwell,

297
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,800
there's no need to force yourself.

298
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,520
It's a mere scratch,

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,880
and it's already healed.

300
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,280
Alright.

301
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,120
Since Lady Xu is vouching for you,

302
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
then the case

303
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,080
will be assigned to the IG.

304
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,360
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,440
Then,

306
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,520
the Imperial Academy

307
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,120
should be handled by Lord Zhang.

308
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
He is a civil official.

309
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,360
It would be easier for him to communicate

310
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,720
with students.

311
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,720
Lord Shen.

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,280
How about you take charge of the security

313
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,240
of the capital region?

314
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,280
Your Royal Highness,

315
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,920
this is a matter of vital importance.

316
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,840
Nothing could go wrong.

317
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
The IG lacks manpower

318
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,000
for full coverage.

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,240
How cunning you are!

320
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,280
You often lament a lack of power.

321
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
But today,

322
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,160
you are making excuses.

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
Do you believe I don't know

324
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,960
what has been going on in your mind?

325
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,280
I wouldn't dare.

326
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,240
Wouldn't dare?

327
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,120
I see that you two are scheming.

328
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,000
You are both quite bold.

329
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
Apologies, Your Royal Highness.

330
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,400
Alright, alright.

331
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,320
As I entrust you with the security,

332
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
you will be given the authority to

333
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
mobilize resources from offices.

334
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,920
During the Academy examination,

335
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,960
any matters related to security

336
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
will be under

337
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,000
your coordination.

338
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,600
Gratitude, Your Royal Highness.

339
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,320
Your Highness!

340
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,680
Mr Zhang has secured the academy's task.

341
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,920
That old bastard!

342
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
He has gotten ahead again.

343
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,840
Now, this is getting interesting.

344
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,600
Your Highness.

345
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,159
Sir.

346
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,159
You came in time.

347
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,280
Take a look at my yellow peony.

348
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,159
Isn't it blooming beautifully?

349
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,840
Good.

350
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,000
[Your Highness.]

351
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,400
[Her Royal Highness]

352
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
has already entrusted

353
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,720
the examination to me.

354
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,240
[The students of the Imperial Academy]

355
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,920
[are the best among scholars in the realm.]

356
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,560
If the examination succeeded,

357
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,640
[you would be]

358
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,080
[be even more advantageous]

359
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
to secure the position of regent.

360
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,080
Sir,

361
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,040
whether Princess Ying

362
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,880
or I become the regent,

363
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,680
we are all here to

364
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,640
serve Her Highness and His Majesty.

365
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,400
That is not correct.

366
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
His Majesty suffers from delayed speech.

367
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,280
Her Highness is in her twilight years.

368
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,040
The regent is of utmost importance

369
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,160
to the foundation of the empire.

370
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,440
On this matter,

371
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
You must not be negligent.

372
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,080
I appreciate your dedication.

373
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,240
Please clear up misunderstandings,

374
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,080
and show love

375
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
and respect to

376
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,520
students from humble backgrounds.

377
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,640
Yes.

378
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,680
Of course.

379
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,440
However,

380
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,240
Shen Du has been tasked with

381
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,560
the responsibility for the capital's security,

382
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,480
which gives him more power.

383
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,160
He is indeed capable.

384
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,720
No matter what situation

385
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,360
he encounters or trouble

386
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,040
he faces,

387
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,000
he always finds a way to handle it.

388
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,840
Sir,

389
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,960
don't you think so?

390
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,920
I agree.

391
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,760
Now that he's

392
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
taken on the security task,

393
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,680
[should the situation]

394
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,400
[in Xiang'an be a bit]

395
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
[more chaotic?]

396
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
Your Highness,

397
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,800
should we "help" him a bit?

398
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,800
I beg your pardon, sir?

399
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,080
You may excuse yourself now.

400
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,360
[Sir,]

401
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,120
[the task of overseeing the examination]

402
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,600
[has ultimately been given to the PM.]

403
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,920
Her Highness has entrusted the security

404
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,760
of the capital region to us.

405
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,880
Is this meant to be a consolation?

406
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,800
This is exactly the outcome I desired.

407
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
You don't seem disappointed.

408
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,800
A gust of wind is coming.

409
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,520
During the examination,

410
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,200
Princess Ying, Prince Xian,

411
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,360
the PM and Lai Luozhi

412
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,840
will surely take action.

413
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
Keep a close watch.

414
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,840
Understood.

415
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,960
The security around the academy

416
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,920
must not be underestimated.

417
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,640
We can mobilize palace guards

418
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
and inspectors for assistance.

419
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,960
And the security of all the imperial

420
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
offices is the same.

421
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,760
Keep our men there,

422
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,120
especially

423
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,960
the Imperial Secretariat.

424
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,120
Yes, sir.

425
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Who is it?

426
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,840
Lord Commander!

427
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,360
Thank you for the gifts you sent to

428
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,880
my family.

429
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,040
They all loved them a lot.

430
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,000
Not worth mentioning.

431
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,200
Anything interesting happened

432
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,000
during the assembly today?

433
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,680
Not much.

434
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,200
Lai Luozhi requested to take over

435
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,120
the investigation of the Chen Huo'e case.

436
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,640
Did Her Royal Highness give it to him?

437
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,840
She gave it to me.

438
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,880
Hey...

439
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,400
Are you saying that the case

440
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,000
will still be handled by the IG?

441
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,640
Bravo!

442
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,560
I'll go prepare ink for you.

443
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
No matter how you tidy up a puppy house,

444
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,720
it will still be a puppy house.

445
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,840
Is your hand

446
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,320
better?

447
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,240
I was bitten by a puppy.

448
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,200
It won't heal that fast.

449
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,080
Lord Commander.

450
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,280
Please read the case files a little.

451
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,400
Rest for a bit.

452
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,400
How about I cook for you?

453
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,880
You know how to cook?

454
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,440
Don't underestimate me.

455
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,880
I am the renowned Lady Yan Xing.

456
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,920
Yeah, right.

457
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,760
"She has extraordinary talents,"

458
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,120
"proficient in writing, painting, embroidery,"

459
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,040
"and classics, and wealthy in knowledge."

460
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,800
"Her reputation as a virtuous lady"

461
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,720
"is unmatched in Xiang'an."

462
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,280
[Let's go.]

463
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,840
Come on.

464
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,760
Please sit.

465
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,520
Sir,

466
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,280
I made these myself.

467
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,160
Give it a try.

468
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,560
Try this chicken.

469
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,280
How is it?

470
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Surprisingly,

471
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,680
it's not bad.

472
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,480
See?

473
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,760
I told you so.

474
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,480
Cooking and autopsy

475
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,680
have similar principles.

476
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,160
Using preservation

477
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,600
and dissecting methods

478
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,720
to handle this chicken,

479
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,640
the taste will be

480
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,600
just like that of a freshly killed one.

481
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,280
Yeah,

482
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,480
Now, try this soup.

483
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,840
The inspiration for using this spice

484
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,480
comes from the spices used by

485
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,560
Lady Tang for preserving corpses.

486
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Smell it.

487
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,720
Isn't the aroma delightful?

488
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
Isn't it?

489
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,520
Very fragrant, right?

490
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,520
Is there something you want?

491
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,920
Just say it.

492
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,360
That fast, really?

493
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,800
Well,

494
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,880
can I participate in

495
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,720
the case?

496
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,520
No, you cannot.

497
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,720
Can't you see

498
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,280
how complicated this case is?

499
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,320
The Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court

500
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,400
are both trying to avoid it.

501
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,480
And you come begging to be part of it?

502
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
I understand.

503
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,640
Lai Luozhi and Princess Ying

504
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,080
both came to see me today.

505
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
In both open and hidden ways,

506
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,120
they just don't want me

507
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,360
to get involved in this case.

508
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,840
But I am just a

509
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,960
lowly clerk.

510
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
Could they really be wary of me?

511
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,280
What they are wary of is just

512
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,360
my title of "Lord Commander's wife."

513
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
if you are aware of all this...

514
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
You have already taken on this case,

515
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
and I am now, without a doubt,

516
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,520
the genuine and rightful

517
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,280
Lord Commander's wife.

518
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
How could I possibly

519
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,080
escape from all this?

520
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,560
If you encounter danger,

521
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,320
how could I possibly remain unscathed?

522
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,520
Forgive me.

523
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,720
What is there to forgive?

524
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,600
Finding the truth

525
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,520
and clearing one's name

526
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,080
has always been my ideal.

527
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,800
I only ask

528
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,480
that you give me

529
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,560
the authority to investigate.

530
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Rest assured,

531
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,160
I will definitely not hold you back.

532
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,800
I won't be a burden to you either.

533
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
But you must promise me

534
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,800
that during the investigation,

535
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,920
if anything happens,

536
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,200
you will discuss it with me first

537
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,120
before making any decisions.

538
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,560
You must not act on your own.

539
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,320
Of course.

540
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,880
You are Lord Commander,

541
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,200
my superior,

542
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,920
so I will definitely follow your command.

543
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,440
Henceforth, my allegiance

544
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,160
lies solely with my Lord Commander.

545
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,880
Is this to your liking?

546
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,040
Silly.

547
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,080
Imperial Guard on duty.

548
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,520
Is Lord Chen Shoujie here?

549
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,280
I am Yan Xing, from the Ministry of Justice.

550
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,960
I have a few questions to ask him.

551
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,960
That night, my lady was in a good mood,

552
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
cooking herself.

553
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,000
She made mutton and smoked chicken.

554
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,840
She also baked flatbreads and stuffed breads.

555
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,760
[She even rewarded me with a bowl of wine.]

556
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
[I slept until midnight,]

557
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,880
[when I suddenly]

558
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
[heard crying.]

559
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,640
[Darling!]

560
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
In the end, Her Lady...

561
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,280
Officer,

562
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,720
be careful.

563
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,240
My Lord!

564
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,480
- My Lord!
- Fire!

565
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,680
My Lord!

566
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,480
Fire!

567
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,120
My Lord!

568
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
- My Lord!
- Moth! (Chen Huo'e's last character)

569
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,200
- There's a fire!
- My Lord!

570
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,480
- There's a fire!
- My Lord!

571
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,640
Moth! Moth!

572
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,880
Is he talking about Chen Huo'e?

573
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,520
Keep distance from the rest of us.

574
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,360
From now on, you just sit...

575
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,720
Here.

576
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,920
Since you are working for Imperial Guard,

577
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,600
then you have nothing to do with

578
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,800
the Ministry of Justice.

579
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
No matter what trouble you cause,

580
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,640
it has nothing to do with us.

581
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,440
The Ministry of Justice

582
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,920
will stay out of this case.

583
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,680
Stay out!

584
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,800
Yan Xing!

585
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,400
Pay attention to me.

586
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,520
No matter what,

587
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,440
at any time,

588
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,000
you must watch your back.

589
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,319
If you die,

590
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:45,160
I will definitely

591
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,480
sing for three days

592
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,840
at Furong Theater, so you won't

593
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,160
be in peace even in the afterlife.

594
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,160
Don't worry,

595
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,719
I'll definitely not let you have your way.

596
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,920
[In the third year of Shengli era,]

597
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,360
[Jinxiu Workshop was punished]

598
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,480
[for presenting summer clothes to]

599
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,920
[Princess, which exceeded the regulations.]

600
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,799
[Because they were ordered by her husband,]

601
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,719
[he committed suicide on site.]

602
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,160
[From then on, Princess Runing]

603
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,440
[fell out with the Empress Dowager.]

604
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,920
[And Jinxiu Workshop]

605
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
[was closed for using patterns]

606
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,920
[that exceeded the regulations,]

607
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
[The owner and his family were executed.]

608
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,400
[This is the Jinxiu Workshop case.]

609
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,720
- Go.
- Let go of me!

610
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,720
[Exceeding regulations.]

611
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,840
[It is rumored that four years ago,]

612
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,920
[the princess' husband longed to be praised,]

613
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,400
[but unexpectedly, Princess Runing]

614
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,160
[wore the same purple chrysanthemum]

615
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,600
[patterned clothing as the queen,]

616
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,520
[which angered]

617
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,920
[the current Empress Dowager.]

618
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,080
[And in this case file, it only]

619
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,880
[vaguely states "exceeding regulations."]

620
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,840
[Seems the case file can't be trusted.]

621
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
[Come and take a look, flatbreads.]

622
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:58,800
[Come on.]

623
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,640
Mr. Pan!

624
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,120
I didn't expect you to be working here.

625
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,400
It makes it difficult for us to find you.

626
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,040
Who are you two?

627
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
I witnessed your quick wit

628
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,800
the other day at the Imperial Academy.

629
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,400
I heard that you are also

630
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,120
going to participate in the examination.

631
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,560
In the future,

632
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,280
we will be classmates!

633
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,400
I am flattered.

634
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,920
- Come on.
- Seriously.

635
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,000
We must share a drink!

636
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,480
- Let's go!
- Come on!

637
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,120
Alright.

638
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,440
- Come on!
- This way, please!

639
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,320
Mr. Pan, this way.

640
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,840
Good, good!

641
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,360
Prince Xian and Prime Minister

642
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,280
cherish talent.

643
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,480
They specifically instructed us

644
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,160
to interact with the students

645
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,240
from humble backgrounds.

646
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,760
So we can better

647
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,000
serve the empire in the future.

648
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Mister,

649
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,080
please take a seat.

650
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,960
No formalities.

651
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,680
[His Majesty is benevolent.]

652
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,160
[This time, the Imperial Academy]

653
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,760
[does not consider social status,]

654

[family background,]

655
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,800
or recommendations,

656
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,880
only focuses on virtue and talent.

657
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,440
[This is a pioneering move.]

658
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,720
It is truly a fortune for scholars.

659
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,720
Indeed!

660
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,240
I'm requested by the PM

661
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,680
[to prepare a modest feast for hospitality.]

662
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,000
[All you scholars,]

663
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,040
be sure to mingle with

664
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,400
each other.

665
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,240
[Come on.]

666
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,080
[Please.]

667
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,160
[Here. Cheers!]

668
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,840
What is the meaning of this?

669
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,080
Prince Xian

670
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,520
has always valued scholars.

671
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
He is concerned that you all

672
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,280
may not find life

673
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,840
in Xiang'an convenient.

674
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,800
[He specially sent this modest gift.]

675
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,360
[You know,]

676
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,960
He has a

677
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
benevolent heart.

678
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,280
[So,]

679
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,800
[please be sure to accept it.]

680
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,080
Is this the gesture from you gentry?

681
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,080
Mr. Pan!

682
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,840
Reject the PM?

683
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,880
Ungrateful brats!

684
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,360
Wealthy families always squander.

685
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,520
They're trying to corrupt our hearts

686
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,360
with such lowly means?

687
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,920
You beggar!

688
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,480
You should have accepted it graciously.

689
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,120
You're the PM's lapdogs.

690
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,440
Are you going to resort to violence?

691
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Violence? Take this!

692
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,160
Eat this!

693
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,720
This is Xiang'an City,

694
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,800
the emperor's turf.

695
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,240
[Go with the flow,]

696
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,960
[so you wouldn't suffer!]

697
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,280
Just be smart, you bastards!

698
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,800
Who are you people?

699
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,640
The PM might be merciful,

700
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,080
but Prince Xian is wise.

701
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,720
Threats and temptations won't work

702
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
on you stupid scholars.

703
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,600
It'd be better to eliminate all of you!

704
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,000
Just for refusing to pledge allegiance to

705
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,640
the PM and Prince Xian,

706
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
must we be silenced?

707
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,080
Wipe them all!

708
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,360
Prince Xian will not spare you!

709
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,040
Hup!

710
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,240
It's you!

711
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,520
Greetings, mighty commander.

712
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,560
Watch out!

713
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,760
This assassin strikes hard and

714
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,640
his weapons are powerful and ruthless.

715
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,080
Be careful!

716
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,960
Yes, sir!

717
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,200
Go after him!

718
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,160
Hurry.

719
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,040
Your Highness!

720
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,760
I've got a note

721
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,240
pinned to the pillar.
