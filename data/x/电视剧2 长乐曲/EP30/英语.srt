[Melody of Golden Age]
[EP30]

3
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,800
I've failed you.

4
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,720
I couldn't kill Shen Du in Yingzhou.

5
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
Have all sect members in Yingzhou

6
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
been completely wiped out?

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,400
Yes...

8
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Trash

9
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,280
has no place here!

10
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,000
You're in bad shape.

11
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
You'll take time to get in fighting form.

12
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
Have you delt with

13
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,760
those masked spectres in Yingzhou?

14
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,400
Poison was planted beforehand.

15
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,000
There will be no survivors!

16
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Very good.

17
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,720
What about the item

18
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,680
left for Shen Du by Mo Qianzhi?

19
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,760
This is it.

20
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,560
Mo Qianzhi

21
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
has been in charge of Yingzhou for so long,

22
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
He probably had the dirt on

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,200
numerous officials.

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,040
A poetry collection?

25
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,240
How could that be?

26
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,400
It must have been switched by

27
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,640
Shen Du back then!

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,240
You were tricked by Shen Du!

29
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,880
I...

30
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,320
[Shen Du,]

31
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,880
[I'm eager to witness]

32
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,360
your next move in this game.

33
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,840
I didn't expect

34
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,200
Lord Zhang's faction has been

35
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
smuggling with Xichen

36
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,120
through Gannan for so many years,

37
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,160
making huge profits.

38
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,639
Princess Ying is cunningly

39
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,440
using funding as a cover to win

40
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,240
the loyalty of the troops at the border.

41
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,280
Qianzhi had quietly gathered

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
compromising information on two factions

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,760
but hadn't reported it.

44
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,200
It seems he didn't trust the imperial court.

45
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,400
Chen Huo'e must be aware of some details,

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
which is why she intended on using

47
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
my resources to locate this booklet.

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,040
So, what's your plan for the next move?

49
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
I think...

50
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,080
[Lord Shen!]

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Lord Shen, we have a situation!

52
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,400
Why the panic?

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,440
The masked spectres we captured

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,400
haven't disclosed anything

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,440
before they all suddenly died.

56
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
My lord, these individuals

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
[must have succumbed to poisoning.]

58
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
[When they were brought in,]

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
[I conducted a thorough search,]

60
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,160
[even inspecting their mouths]

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,280
[to check their teeth.]

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,000
There was absolutely no chance

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
for them to have poisoned themselves.

64
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,160
The needle mark...

65
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,160
So this is...

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
Have you discovered anything?

67
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,560
Jing Lin was right.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,640
These spectres must have been poisoned

69
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,560
by some form of chronic toxin

70
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,680
before they were brought in.

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,760
Could you identify

72
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
what type of poison it is?

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,080
Absolutely.

74
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,720
However, it will require some time.

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
Report once you have confirmation.

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,560
[Understood, my lord.]

77
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
Time for us to return to Xiang'an.

78
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
What are you reading?

79
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Throughout our journey,

80
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,280
we've passed

81
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,640
through numerous places,

82
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,880
and these

83
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
are my notes

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,280
from interaction with the locals.

85
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,040
Did you uncover anything noteworthy?

86
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,120
From their recollections,

87
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,160
I did stumble upon something intriguing.

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
The year prior to the Shens' incident,

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
the empire experienced severe flooding.

90
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,080
Many people endured great hardship

91
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,560
due to food shortages.

92
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,160
However, here in Gannan

93
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
the locals' memories

94
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
indicate that some areas

95
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,480
were indeed affected by the floods.

96
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,880
Logically speaking,

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,600
there should have been a food shortage.

98
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,960
Yet the grain prices not only didn't

99
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,160
rise but actually dropped significantly.

100
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,520
Where did this seemingly abundant

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
grain come from?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
Are you implying that...

103
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
There is indeed a possibility

104
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,880
that someone secretly took the

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,440
public grain from the official granaries.

106
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,480
[Assassins!]

107
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,320
[Xing.]

108
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,080
Let's go!

109
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,080
No need to get caught up in battle.

110
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,080
Let's head to the palace!

111
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,000
Lord Shen treats the empire like his own family.

112
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,400
[You've barely set foot in the capital,]

113
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,840
[and already you're here to report in.]

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,920
No wonder my mother

115
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,600
holds you in such high esteem.

116
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,880
Princess Ying, I'm flattered.

117
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,760
I'm simply doing my utmost

118
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,720
to honor the trust

119
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,080
placed in me by Her Majesty.

120
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,960
If you truly mean it,

121
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,200
splendid.

122
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,280
It would honor my mother's

123
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,720
thoughtful regard for you.

124
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,680
May you soar to great heights.

125
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,040
What do you mean by that, Your Highness?

126
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,880
Never mind.

127
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,120
It's getting late tonight.

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,360
My darling must be tired as well, right?

129
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
Shen Du, let's continue

130
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,160
our conversation when you visit me later.

131
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
Your Majesty, please have some tea.

132
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,280
[Your Majesty,]

133
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,400
they have arrived.

134
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

135
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,200
May you be graced with eternal well-being.

136
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,520
You may rise.

137
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,640
[Lord Shen,]

138
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,240
I've already reviewed

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,480
the report you submitted.

140
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,680
[Mo Qianzhi is dead.]

141
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,720
[The rebels have been eliminated,]

142
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,680
and the spectres have been wiped out.

143
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,560
[Your actions in Yingzhou were commendable.]

144
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,200
During your investigation,

145
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,920
have you encountered any challenges?

146
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,360
By the grace of Your Majesty,

147
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,640
all had been well.

148
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,040
What reward should I bestow upon you,

149
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,320
my lord?

150
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,280
Shen Du is already the head of

151
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,080
Imperial Guard, overseeing officials at

152
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,120
[all levels, and holds a top rank title.]

153
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,800
So his position

154
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
doesn't leave much room for advancement.

155
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,800
[You certainly have a way with words!]

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
It's my high esteem for you

157
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
that allows you to speak so freely!

158
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,840
Fortunately,

159
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
Lord Shen is a confidant.

160
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,160
[Otherwise,]

161
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,760
[it might give the impression]

162
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,760
that I want to use your tongue

163
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
to reprimand Lord Shen.

164
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
Apologies, Your Majesty,

165
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,520
Baohuan acknowledges my mistake.

166
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,760
Lord Shen,

167
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,840
[what are your thoughts?]

168
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,720
What reward do you desire?

169
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,960
Feel free to tell me.

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
I will certainly grant it.

171
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
Those were all but my duty as a subject;

172
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,520
no reward is necessary.

173
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,760
Regarding the mission in Yingzhou,

174
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,160
if it weren't for my lady by my side,

175
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,920
It likely wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

176
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
If there's to be a reward,

177
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,320
it should go to Yan Xing, the scribe.

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,800
So you are

179
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,640
seeking a reward for your own lady.

180
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,400
[It seems this task in Yingzhou]

181
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,280
has deepened the bond between you two.

182
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,240
I've truly done a good deed!

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
Gratitude, Your Majesty.

184
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,440
[Please rise.]

185
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,960
Lord Shen is truly a pillar of the state,

186
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
achieving greatness without seeking credit.

187
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,560
Very well.

188
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
As for the rewards,

189
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,320
I will honor your wishes

190
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,800
and grant them to your wife.

191
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,920
For her meritorious service in quelling the rebels,

192
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,560
Lady Yan is promoted to the Chief Clerk

193
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,360
under the Ministry of Justice, rank six, junior grade.

194
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,280
Gratitude, Your Majesty.

195
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,680
[Lady Yan,]

196
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,440
is there anything else

197
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,080
you particularly seek as a reward?

198
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,160
Your Majesty,

199
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,720
I have no other

200
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,120
wishes for rewards.

201
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,640
You should think carefully;

202
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,160
this is a rare opportunity.

203
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,120
My words are all sincere.

204
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,920
I seek no reward,

205
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,760
only a peaceful and just world.

206
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,720
Commendable!

207
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,200
[Lady Yan,]

208
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,160
[despite being a woman,]

209
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,720
[your heart is with the empire.]

210
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,520
Our empire needs

211
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,880
more officials

212
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,040
with your spirit.

213
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,000
I heard you faced a

214
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,440
dire crisis in Yingzhou

215
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
and nearly lost your lives.

216
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,120
[Send for the imperial healer to attend to you.]

217
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,640
[Yes, Your Royal Highness.]

218
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,080
What's bothering you?

219
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
Why do you look so downcast

220
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,040
after receiving a promotion?

221
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,600
Congratulations, Chief Clerk!

222
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,240
I just started to piece it together.

223
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
Our achievement is quite significant.

224
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,680
Her Majesty wouldn't want to appear ungrateful,

225
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,120
but she also doesn't want to reward you.

226
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,600
Zhang Baohuan

227
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,360
must have seen through

228
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,760
her intentions

229
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,640
and colluded with Lady Xu.

230
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,360
They claimed there's nothing to reward,

231
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,680
just to prevent you from taking credit.

232
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,440
If it weren't for your cunning move

233
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,840
to get past the subject,

234
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,480
who knows what might have happened.

235
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,160
What about the booklet

236
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,120
that Lord Mo left for you?

237
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
How do you plan to deal with it?

238
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,320
That booklet involves many parties.

239
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,120
I'll seize the right moment to unveil it.

240
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,040
You're sharper than a fox!

241
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,360
You entered the palace at night

242
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
to debrief Her Majesty

243
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,360
but didn't mention the booklet,

244
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
just to keep some officials guessing.

245
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,800
This way, some people will be on edge,

246
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,240
and they probably won't

247
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
get a good night sleep.

248
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,000
My lady is the one who

249
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,360
truly understands me.

250
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,160
So, you did

251
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,440
all the work, yet I claimed the credit.

252
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,040
Princess Ying praised your dedication,

253
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,880
but surely you don't need to

254
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,160
be so dedicated that

255
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,200
you stay up all night?

256
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
There's some place

257
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,040
I would like you, my lady, to see.

258
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,120
Let's go.

259
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,760
What is this...

260
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,280
Here's something I'd like

261
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
you to know.

262
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,840
Years ago, the Shen Family faced disaster,

263
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,360
and my mother fell gravely ill.

264
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
Knowing her time was short,

265
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,560
she had me write a confession.

266
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
I don't know how.

267
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,360
I also shouldn't.

268
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,440
Father preferred death

269
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,640
over living with a tarnished name.

270
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,480
I prefer to die nobly,

271
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,520
as my father would.

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,920
But if you die too,

273
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
then this injustice

274
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,840
will truly be buried forever.

275
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,240
The countless

276
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,320
wrongful deaths

277
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,920
in the Shen Family,

278
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
including your father,

279
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,400
their grievances,

280
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,760
and the truth they always sought

281
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,200
will remain unknown forever!

282
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,360
[She also advised me to endure for]

283
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,120
[a while, then enter public service,]

284
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,880
[so I would have the chance]

285
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
[to restore the Shen Family's honor.]

286
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,320
From that day on,

287
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,320
my life

288
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,280
has been lived solely for revenge.

289
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,800
I carry on my shoulders the

290
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,560
grievances of many Shen Family members.

291
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,160
Searching for the truth of the incident

292
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,320
has become my

293
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,960
only reason to live.

294
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,560
The world may have forgotten,

295
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,600
[or perhaps no one cares,]

296
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,480
[but I remember clearly]

297
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
and cannot forget for a moment

298
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,080
every innocent person

299
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,600
who perished with the Shen Family.

300
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,560
Not just you,

301
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,080
but also me.

302
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
I remember it well,

303
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,760
I have never forgotten Uncle Shen.

304
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,680
[When the Shen Family fell into misfortune,]

305
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,560
people said

306
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
that Uncle Shen had betrayed the empire

307
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,040
I refused to believe it.

308
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
He was the most upright and selfless man

309
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,040
I have ever known,

310
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
and he would never have committed an

311
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,600
act that harms the empire or its people.

312
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,520
So from that moment on,

313
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,160
I made a vow

314
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,960
to become a female official

315
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
and enter the Ministry of Justice,

316
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,520
hoping that one day

317
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,120
I could uncover the truth myself.

318
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,560
The world may call me The White Death

319
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,560
but I have come to accept

320
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,440
that I am just a wandering soul.

321
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,520
I walk alone in this purgatory.

322
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,840
I truly didn't expect that

323
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
there would be someone as foolish as me.

324
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,360
You are clearly warm,

325
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,400
alive and vibrant,

326
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,640
how could you be a wandering soul?

327
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
This heart

328
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,080
is filled with

329
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,200
the expectations of so many people.

330
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,640
From now on,

331
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,840
you will no longer be alone.

332
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,880
I will definitely strive

333
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,400
to help you uncover the truth

334
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,440
and restore the honor of the Shens.

335
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,840
Fetch the horse.

336
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,080
My lord,

337
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,200
[my lady,]

338
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,080
[you're finally back!]

339
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
Sorry to have caused you worry.

340
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,160
My lady, take your time.

341
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm not eager at all...

342
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,960
The ancestors of the Shen Family

343
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,200
are surely watching over us.

344
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,360
My lord has finally seen the light!

345
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,000
Finally!

346
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,200
Finally!

347
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,400
It's getting late now.

348
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,360
My lady, you should get some sleep.

349
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,920
Alright.

350
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,440
Where are you going?

351
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,160
To sleep...

352
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,680
There's a more

353
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,280
critical issue at hand.

354
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
Shen Du, I...

355
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,000
You said it yourself

356
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,480
that I wouldn't

357
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,560
be alone anymore.

358
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,480
Since you've had the audacity to barge in my life,

359
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,720
don't think you can easily get away.

360
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,600
I am Yan Xing.

361
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,080
My word is my bond; once spoken,

362
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,480
it cannot be taken back.

363
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,840
[Lord Zhang has arrived!]

364
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,640
On behalf of Her Majesty,

365
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,440
I hereby reward Chief Clerk of the

366
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Ministry of Justice, Lady Yan Xing,

367
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,040
[with ten thousand bolts of silk]

368
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,320
[and ten thousand taels of gold,]

369
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,160
[to recognize her meritorious service]

370
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,000
and spread the royal grace!

371
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,800
I am honored by the favor of Her Majesty.

372
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,080
Her Majesty has another decree.

373
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,840
Her Majesty' decree states:

374
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,480
the commander of Imperial Guard, Shen Du

375
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
[has successfully quelled the rebellion]

376
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,640
[and forged alliances with neighboring states,]

377
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,280
[demonstrating exceptional merit.]

378
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,800
[In recognition of his contributions,]

379
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
royal princess, Jia'an,

380
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,440
[gentle and wise,]

381
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,440
[with grace and poise,]

382
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
[conducting herself with elegance.]

383
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,720
[She is well-versed in etiquette,]

384
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,200
and now of marriageable age,

385
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,440
waiting in her royal chamber.

386
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
[The two are a match made by God.]

387
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,760
[By imperial decree, I approve their union.]

388
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,200
[Let your unity strengthen the realm,]

389
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,000
[united in purpose.]

390
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,880
[Lord Shen,]

391
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
this is the decree of Her Majesty,

392
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
[not to be altered]

393
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,640
[by others.]

394
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,240
Accept it first and foremost.

395
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,160
Lord Zhang has already seen it.

396
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,000
I have no intention

397
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,320
of marrying Princess Jia'an.

398
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,440
My beloved wife also

399
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
does not wish me to take another wife.

400
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,800
I hope you will convey this to Her Majesty.

401
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,240
[Are you aware of the reason that Her]

402
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,080
Majesty asked me to announce this decree?

403
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,360
Such matters of reward

404
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,920
[should be handled by]

405
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,320
[the Ministry of Rites,]

406
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,680
so why was I sent in their stead?

407
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,560
Why is that?

408
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,600
You fail to grasp,

409
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,240
does Lord Shen also fail to comprehend?

410
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,360
Please speak plainly

411
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,360
and do not leave me guessing.

412
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
[For the sake of Han Shiyuan]

413
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,720
[who is now marrying into]

414
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
[your Yan Family,]

415
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,000
[I will share this with you.]

416
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,000
So that Shiyuan won't hold

417
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,480
[a grudge against me.]

418
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,440
Think about it,

419
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Princess Jia'an is the most beloved

420
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,720
daughter of Princess Ying.

421
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,800
[And Princess Ying is]

422
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,120
[Her Majesty' most cherished daughter.]

423
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
Princess Ying's temperament is very

424
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,040
similar to that of Her Majesty,

425
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
which is why she receives the most favor,

426
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,080
[even surpassing Prince Xian.]

427
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,080
[In this context,]

428
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,240
[why bestow Princess Jia'an]

429
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,640
[upon Lord Shen]

430
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,880
as a primary wife?

431
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,400
[Lord Shen wields immense power,]

432
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,560
[with exceptional achievements,]

433
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,040
[and enjoys a status]

434
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
[that places him above all others.]

435
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
He supervises all other officials.

436
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,600
Yet, he stands alone,

437
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,400
with no support behind him.

438
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,480
He has even

439
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
married you,

440
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,000
a mere rank six official.

441
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,680
[Even if Princess Jia'an wishes to marry,]

442
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,080
[she should be able to choose freely among]

443
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,240
[the royal family.]

444
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,040
[Why must she marry Shen Du?]

445
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,040
[Your father mentioned that]

446
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,120
[now the Shen Family has only Shen Du left.]

447
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,040
The only ones still connected to the Shens

448
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,960
are Mo Qianzhi and Zhong.

449
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,000
[Mo Qianzhi has already passed away,]

450
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,560
[so. in the imperial court,]

451
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
[Shen Du is truly]

452
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,040
[the most isolated individual.]

453
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,680
[He also oversees all officials,]

454
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,960
[and any mistake he makes]

455
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,080
[could easily lead to his downfall.]

456
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,040
[So, sacrifices are]

457
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,480
necessary to catch your target.

458
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,600
And Shen Du is the target.

459
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,080
Lord Zhang,

460
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,080
I can bear whatever precautions

461
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Her Majesty takes against me.

462
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,120
But a marriage decree is unnecessary.

463
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,480
I am already married.

464
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,520
I will not marry again in this lifetime.

465
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,360
Lord Zhang, I'm going to the palace to

466
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,280
plead with Her Majesty for reconsideration.

467
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,320
Shen Du...

468
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,240
-Lord Shen!
-Shen Du!

469
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,200
Are you attempting to defy the decree?

470
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,000
Your Majesty,

471
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,960
I share a deep bond with my wife.

472
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,400
Furthermore, I oversee the cabinet, and

473
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,040
many officials harbor discontent against me.

474
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,640
This isn't a position of wealth and comfort,

475
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,920
and I do not wish for Princess Jia'an

476
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,960
to suffer by marrying me.

477
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,120
Princess Jia'an is not someone you

478
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,040
could match without my assistance.

479
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,080
Princess Jia'an's distinguished lineage

480
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,520
places her far above me,

481
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
and I am too humble to even consider her.

482
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,400
I implore Your Majesty to retract the decree.

483
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,200
You...

484
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,200
Insolence!

485
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,280
I've served the empire for many years and

486
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,520
have never considered my own interests.

487
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,480
Only today,

488
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,240
I earnestly beseech Your Majesty.

489
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,840
I will repay you with unwavering loyalty,

490
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,880
dedicating myself until my last breath!

491
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,320
Lord Shen's loyalty has never faltered,

492
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,320
his heart a reflection of his integrity.

493
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,040
Your Royal Highness, please reconsider.

494
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,560
I understand,

495
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,600
Your Majesty

496
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,080
is sincerely paving the way for me.

497
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,240
I stand with a clear and sincere heart,

498
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,200
dedicated to easing your burdens.

499
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,200
If I need to marry Princess Jia'an

500
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,319
to secure my career path,

501
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,440
then it would suggest that Your Majesty

502
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,040
does not have faith in my abilities.

503
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,520
Your Majesty.

504
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,960
What is it now?

505
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,400
Something happened at the Ming Hall!

506
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,759
What?

507
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,600
My men have performed numerous

508
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,799
checks and uncovered no irregularities.

509
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,200
But this time,

510
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,880
their greed

511
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,080
led to mistakes,

512
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,319
which were finally caught.

513
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,000
[After my men went back to investigate,]

514
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,799
[they uncovered the problem.]

515
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,680
Someone had split the accounts into two ledgers.

516
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
Two ledgers?

517
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
What are they exactly?

518
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Regarding these two ledgers,

519
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,160
[one of them is an official ledger,]

520
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,800
[using the Longmen accounting method,]

521
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,760
but secretly,

522
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,200
there is another ledger,

523
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,680
maintained with the Sijiao method.

524
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,960
Continue.

525
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,800
The official one

526
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,240
which uses the Longmen method

527
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,440
reveals the artistry of the accountant.

528
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
From the ledger,

529
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,360
indeed, no issues can be discerned.

530
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,120
[Thus, since the founding of the Ming Hall,]

531
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
the officials responsible for the audits

532
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,680
have uncovered no issues.

533
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
The recently discovered

534
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
other ledger

535
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,200
utilizes Sijiao method,

536
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,560
so at first glance,

537
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,960
it's difficult to detect any connection

538
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,240
with Ming Hall.

539
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,080
What is the discrepancy?

540
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,640
[Outrageous!]

541
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,120
They truly have the audacity to embezzle

542
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,360
over twenty million taels of silver!

543
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,240
All officials involved in the

544
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
reconstruction are implicated,

545
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,880
except for Lord Zhang Baohuan.

546
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,080
Baohuan is not adept at accounting

547
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,080
[and lacks the boldness.]

548
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,720
However,

549
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,280
Ming Hall

550
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,960
was entrusted to him for oversight,

551
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,520
[so he's to blame for poor oversight.]

552
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,000
Relieve him of his duties.

553
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,360
Let him retire for convalescence.

554
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,520
Yes.

555
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,160
As for the others...

556
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,040
These officials

557
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,600
belong to various factions...

558
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,200
Various factions?

559
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,680
Even my Zhou Family?

560
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
All of this is merely my conjecture.

561
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,240
Please forgive my insolence!

562
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,240
You are not to blame.

563
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,800
I thought that although

564
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,240
[the officials have their own agendas,]

565
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,200
[they all care for the empire.]

566
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,040
I never thought catastrophe

567
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,600
would start from such small beginnings.

568
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,520
[Now,]

569
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,680
the undercurrents are surging,

570
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,960
and hearts are difficult to read.

571
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,520
Your Majesty is devoted to the empire,

572
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,520
yet the officials each

573
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,440
harbor their own agendas,

574
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,440
particularly following the suicide of

575
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,240
the governor of Yingzhou province,

576
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,600
Mo Qianzhi.

577
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,720
With the position in the Gannan vacant,

578
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,000
it seems they

579
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
are all getting impatient.

580
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,360
It's time to give them a stern warning!

581
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,360
Your Majesty,

582
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,200
Personal interactions between Imperial

583
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,680
Guard and other offices are infrequent,

584
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,760
and Shen Du is diligent in his duties.

585
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
He'd be a good candidate for investigation.

586
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,880
[However,]

587
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,160
[if he marries Princess Jia'an,]

588
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,720
it might complicate

589
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,560
his work in the future.

590
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,840
You want to help him out of trouble,

591
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,280
but you must see if he is clever enough.

592
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,160
Regarding Ming Hall,

593
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,520
do not make it public yet;

594
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,200
investigate discreetly.

595
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,520
Understood.

596
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,680
Issue my decrees separately to

597
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,400
the Imperial Inspectorate

598
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,160
and the Imperial Guard.

599
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,560
You truly fear nothing.

600
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,680
I had expected to at least

601
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,640
endure some corporal punishment,

602
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,920
but it was less arduous than I had thought.

603
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,800
Are you suggesting that the

604
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,440
annulment of the decree was achieved?

605
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,560
Not necessarily.

606
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,120
Her Majesty

607
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,080
has yet to vent her anger.

608
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,720
The marriage decree came suspiciously,

609
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,200
and it likely ties back to that booklet.

610
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,800
Princess Ying must be anxious about

611
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,760
my potential disclosure of her

612
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,560
financial backing for the Ying troops,

613
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,440
leading her to enlist Her Majesty

614
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,400
to bind me with a marriage.

615
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,760
But unfortunately, Her Royal Highness

616
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,680
is preoccupied with other matters.

617
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,640
Is it the issue related to Ming Hall?

618
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,440
Did you know about this all along?

619
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,200
Shen Du,

620
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,320
could it be that

621
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,040
Lady Xu's report on this was not

622
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,320
a mere coincidence?

623
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
People are unaware

624
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,520
that the Ming Hall holds deep significance

625
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,800
for Her Majesty.

626
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,400
It symbolizes the affection between

627
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,080
Her and the late emperor.

628
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,520
After the fire at the Ming Hall,

629
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,560
Her Majesty has been deeply

630
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,600
concerned about the reconstruction.

631
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,760
Not only did she appoint

632
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,720
her most trusted

633
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,920
Zhang Baohuan to oversee it,

634
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,920
but she also issued a decree that there

635
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,400
would be no limit on the renovation funds.

636
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,880
No limit?

637
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,320
Unlimited funds

638
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,920
does not mean that the corrupt officials

639
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,320
can fill their pockets.

640
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,640
How many people are implicated?

641
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,720
It's possible to destabilize the imperial court.

642
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,760
They have truly infuriated

643
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,880
Her Majesty.
