[Melody of Golden Age]
[EP28]

3
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,800
Lady Yan,

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Is there truly no

5
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
way to bring someone back to life?

6
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,440
This world is rife with injustice,

7
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
especially towards women.

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
[At home, one must obey the father,]

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
[and upon marriage, the husband,]

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,920
As for all the so called women's virtues,

11
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,320
If one makes even the slightest misstep,

12
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,960
we will face scorn.

13
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
The constant barrage of

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,960
criticism will be overwhelming.

15
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,400
Just think about it,

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,720
how ironic is this?

17
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,200
But if one only clings to these notions,

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,200
how can they ever seek

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,320
true fairness?

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Xiu,

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,960
how did you come to know Lord. Mo?

22
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,000
And why do you refer to him as Qianzhi?

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
[He once saved my life.]

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
[However,]

25
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,320
perhaps at that time,

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,120
he had already

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,680
selected me as a sacrifice.

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,240
You do bear some

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,000
resemblance to Mo Xiuxiu.

30
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,480
[But Xiu]

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,560
is not Mo Xiuxiu after all.

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,120
Halt!

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,880
Stay where you are!

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,320
Jing Lin, stay alert.

35
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,200
What is the meaning of this?

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,600
Release Lord Mo, now!

37
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,040
He's conspired with the Fire Moth Sect,

38
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,200
exploiting his power and slaughtering innocents.

39
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,280
The IG has been ordered to apprehend him.

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,480
This is sheer nonsense!

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,360
Lord Mo is a guardian of the people,

42
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,360
[fighting valiantly against the spectres.]

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,480
[When the criminal Ji Dafu was executed,]

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,760
Lord Shen intervened multiple times,

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,240
clearly with ulterior motives.

46
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,800
Lord Mo instructed us

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,840
to remain vigilant.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,000
And indeed,

49
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,560
we uncovered that you

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,360
[were secretly colluding with the spectres.]

51
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,920
[Now,]

52
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,400
[you're caught abducting Lord Mo]

53
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
[and turn the tables on us?]

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,400
You are framing us!

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Since Lord Shen's arrival,

56
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,360
[the masked spectres have emerged]

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
[like mushrooms after a rainstorm.]

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Is this merely a coincidence?

59
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,960
[This is utterly foolish.]

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,960
You have all been

61
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
deceived by Mo Qianzhi's facade!

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
Exactly who abducted you all?

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,960
Xiu,

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
you must reveal the truth.

65
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,480
Mo is the one colluding with the spectres,

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,120
planning to use you

67
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
as sacrifices.

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
Shen Du,

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,840
[we haven't met in years.]

70
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,680
[I never imagined you'd]

71
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,640
[end up to be such a corrupted official.]

72
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
Surrender yourselves!

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,960
Corrupt officials!

74
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
Release Lord Mo at once!

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
Mo Qianzhi is the true culprit behind the

76
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,760
masked spectres' atrocities in the city.

77
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,320
He has exploited

78
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,640
the trust of all of you!

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,440
The White Death!

80
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
Release Lord Mo immediately!

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,560
[Lord Mo is a compassionate official]

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
[who genuinely cares for the people!]

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
[He is always concerned about us.]

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Don't you frame him!

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,000
Release Lord Mo!

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,520
What are you trying to do?

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,040
Step back! Back!

88
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,520
Don't harm the civilians!

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,640
Neither violence nor reasoning

90
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
will resolve this situation.

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
[These people]

92
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,120
[have lost their minds!]

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,920
Shen Du,

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,680
[guise or genuine,]

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
[they've figured it out,]

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,040
have you?

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,440
So this is your true scheme.

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
Hold on!

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,160
Stop!

100
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
Sun Tan!

101
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Are you delinquents revolting?

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
Apologies, Lord Mo.

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
You all know

104
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,520
how difficult we are to deal with!

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Everyone, step back! Step back!

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,760
Let them go!

107
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,160
Come on. Move!

108
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,120
We're grateful for your aid earlier.

109
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,160
Lord Shen, I'm truly humbled.

110
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,800
Chief has sent a letter instructing me

111
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,360
to assist Lady Yan with the investigation.

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,080
This is indeed our duty.

113
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
If it weren't for your aid earlier,

114
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,320
the citizens in the city

115
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,560
would have surely

116
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
drowned us with their spittle.

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880
To the people of Yingzhou,

118
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,200
Lord Mo is a

119
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,400
rare and exemplary official.

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
In disasters, he opens soup kitchens,

121
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
offering free porridge to those in need.

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,240
On normal days, he leads the constables

123
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,680
to repair houses for the citizens

124
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,200
[without any charge.]

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
[With his exceptional behavior,]

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,920
[how could the people]

127
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
ever perceive him as a villain?

128
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,720
On one hand, he's cherished by the people,

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,240
and respected by his peers as a virtuous man,

130
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
while on the other, he is a madman who

131
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,200
disregards life and follows a cult.

132
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,680
It's hard to see through

133
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
these two personas.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,760
For now, we can only stay outside the city

135
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
and observe how things unfold.

136
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,320
I truly appreciate

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,720
the delinquents, our brothers-in-arms,

138
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,280
who have stood by us in this situation.

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
I, the head of the Delinquents

140
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,760
in Gannan,

141
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,920
place my trust in those

142
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,920
acknowledged by our chief.

143
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Lord Shen,

144
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,880
we've just received a classified message

145
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,000
from Xiang'an.

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,720
Her Majesty has issued a decree to mobilize

147
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,320
the troops of the neighboring counties.

148
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,520
She orders me and General Zhenyuan

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,520
to capture Mo Qianzhi alive.

150
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,840
But Mo Qianzhi just drove us

151
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,880
out of the city.

152
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,400
The message came with unexpected haste!

153
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,320
Prior to our arrival,

154
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,400
Her Majesty summoned me and

155
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,160
[ordered me to keep an eye on Mo Qianzhi.]

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,080
Upon my arrival in Yingzhou,

157
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,080
an agent reached me through covert means.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,200
That must be Biqiu

159
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,280
who was murdered not long ago.

160
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,400
It's very likely that Mo

161
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,840
sensed something amiss and reported

162
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,440
the news to Xiang'an early this morning.

163
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,200
So it appears,

164
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
the entire world,

165
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
inside and outside the imperial realm,

166
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,600
is under Her Majesty's

167
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,080
watchful eye.

168
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Based on this, it is evident

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,560
that sending me to Gannan region

170
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,840
to handle the case of the masked spectre

171
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
was also part of Her Majesty's

172
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
calculations.

173
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,600
Her Majesty

174
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
has ordered you to seize Yingzhou.

175
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,080
If a war breaks out,

176
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,760
what will happen to the citizens within?

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
I pray for a turn in our fortunes

178
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
before General Zhenyuan's arrival.

179
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,520
Who is it?

180
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,200
Who is it?

181
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Show yourself!

182
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,360
Qi Yeyun?

183
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,560
Sneaking around,

184
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,080
you want us to catch you or something?

185
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
Sis taught me to act this way.

186
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,520
Always observe carefully first,

187
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,080
Caution ensures lasting safety!

188
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
[I, Shen Du, am here.]

189
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,400
[I need to have a word with Mo Qianzhi!]

190
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
If you want to talk,

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,640
come up and talk!

192
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,320
You really dare to come alone,

193
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
aren't you afraid I could end you?

194
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
I'm here to deliver

195
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,080
the ultimatum.

196
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,320
Xiang'an's aware of your suspicious activities.

197
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,960
Her Majesty has dispatched troops

198
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
to Yingzhou.

199
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
It's not too late to back down now.

200
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,520
They planned to launch an attack?

201
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,800
It won't be as simple

202
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,680
as they think.

203
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,120
You believe that the

204
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,200
tens of thousands of citizens in the city,

205
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
along with those few masked spectres,

206
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,320
are enough to challenge

207
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
the imperial army?

208
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,040
The will of the masses

209
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,800
can stand against legions.

210
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Do you recall the vow you made

211
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,320
when you became my father's disciple?

212
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
To serve the empire with loyalty

213
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
without disappointing the populace.

214
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,920
Shen Du,

215
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,160
I honestly never imagined

216
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,040
that one day you would say this to me.

217
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,560
Can't you see

218
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,720
that the current empire

219
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
is already infested with corruption?

220
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,640
Its downfall is just a matter of time.

221
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
Then eliminate these corrupt elements

222
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
instead of toppling the entire empire.

223
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,200
The Fire Moth Sect

224
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,520
has always been ruthless,

225
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
ready to betray anyone at any moment.

226
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,280
Are you really willing to gamble

227
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,040
with the lives of

228
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,240
these innocent citizens?

229
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,600
If you want to negotiate,

230
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm open to it,

231
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,600
but you must agree to one condition.

232
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,160
What condition?

233
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,560
Bring me

234
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,880
the head of Lady Yan.

235
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,240
Then there's nothing to discuss.

236
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,680
My dear Du,

237
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,240
she is the Queen's pawn,

238
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
[a mere tool used by her]

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
[to manipulate you!]

240
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,960
Without her,

241
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
you will finally see clearly

242
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,480
the true state of devastation

243
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,280
that has befallen the empire!

244
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,920
The one blinded by hatred

245
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,680
is you.

246
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,040
This time,

247
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,240
you've truly made a mistake.

248
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,080
I made a mistake?

249
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,640
You're treating your foe like a father.

250
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,840
No,

251
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,320
like a mother, I suppose.

252
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,040
What she consumes daily

253
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,120
is the delicacies stained with

254
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,280
the blood of your kin!

255
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
[What she revels in]

256
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,960
is the wealth and luxury built upon

257
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,080
the bones of your kin!

258
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,480
I made a mistake?

259
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,560
Aren't you even more absurdly wrong!

260
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
Don't you yearn to uncover the truth?

261
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,160
This is a sack used for storing supplies.

262
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
Why does it bear the mark

263
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
of the granary from back then,

264
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,480
and why is it found

265
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,160
in Gannan, a thousand miles away?

266
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
Shouldn't these

267
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,440
have been destroyed

268
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,960
in the fire back then?

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
Have you ever considered

270
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,360
that my master,

271
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,080
your father

272
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
was actually guarding

273
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,480
a treasury

274
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
that had already been emptied!

275
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,120
I will uncover the truth myself.

276
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,520
But you want to gamble

277
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,360
the lives of all the citizens in this city

278
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
and risk a massacre

279
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,600
to secure your own future.

280
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,160
I'm afraid I must disagree!

281
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,240
Just stop.

282
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,360
I have very few

283
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,840
loved ones left in this world.

284
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,960
I don't need your approval.

285
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,320
There's no turning back now.

286
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,360
I have planned and endured for so long,

287
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,720
I won't let it all go to waste.

288
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,320
I remember

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,000
you said you wanted revenge, right?

290
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,960
Of course I want revenge,

291
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,960
but I

292
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,520
and my father

293
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,200
would never risk

294
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,640
the lives of the citizens for revenge!

295
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Lord Shen.

296
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,520
Shen Du,

297
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,760
how did it go?

298
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,040
There's no room for negotiation.

299
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,040
Jing Lin, where is

300
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,760
General Zhenyuan's current location?

301
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
We've received word from Mengzhou that

302
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,440
reinforcements should arrive in three days.

303
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,520
As for Mo Qianzhi,

304
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,080
who knows how many troops he has amassed?

305
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,000
If by then all the able-bodied

306
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,600
men in the city come to defend,

307
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,120
it will surely be a fierce battle.

308
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,120
Not necessarily!

309
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,800
Mr. Pan, your efficiency is remarkable.

310
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,320
Lord Shen,

311
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,640
we've brought the things

312
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,840
that you requested.

313
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,440
What are these...

314
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,080
What do you need these bamboo poles for?

315
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,080
Employing a daring strategy.

316
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,440
Success or failure, it's all on this!

317
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
You're not planning to

318
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,480
capture the city before

319
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
General Zhenyuan arrives, are you?

320
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,960
Qianzhi,

321
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,440
people often say

322
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,520
let the past

323
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,800
be the past.

324
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,880
But some pains

325
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,400
aren't just memories; they are

326
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
deeply embedded in our flesh and blood.

327
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,720
They resonate with

328
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,600
every breath,

329
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,560
[It constantly destroys,]

330
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,520
[curses,]

331
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,040
asking why I haven't ended my life yet.

332
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,480
For those

333
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,040
who have never truly experienced it,

334
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,560
how could they possibly know

335
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,760
and on what grounds can they teach others

336
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,680
how to live?

337
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,040
Xiu,

338
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,360
do you think

339
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
I am wrong?

340
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,680
You are a good official,

341
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,000
a great brother.

342
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,240
[You are the]

343
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,680
[kindest soul I know.]

344
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,400
You rescued me

345
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,160
from the piles of corpses.

346
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,560
[You saved my life]

347
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,920
[and helped countless others in the city.]

348
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,880
You have never wronged anyone.

349
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,000
It is this world

350
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
that has failed you far too much.

351
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,600
You are just like her,

352
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,160
always trusting me without hesitation,

353
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,240
while I have let you both down.

354
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,280
If one day,

355
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,640
she truly returns to life,

356
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
I fear she may not recognize

357
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
the man her brother

358
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,040
have turned into now.

359
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,480
If it were possible,

360
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,400
I would genuinely like to know

361
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,200
what the original you

362
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
was truly like.

363
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
People above, heed my words!

364
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,560
General Zhenyuan commands a hundred thousand strong,

365
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
and has reached the outskirts.

366
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,120
[Safeguard the citizens]

367
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,600
[and crush the rebels!]

368
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,160
This would be your last chance.

369
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,600
Surrender, and you will not be harmed!

370
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,960
[If you remain obstinate,]

371
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,840
we will wipe out the traitors

372
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,560
to safeguard our people!

373
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,600
[Lord Mo!]

374
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,280
Lord Mo!

375
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
If this battle can be averted,

376
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,440
please spare the people in this city

377
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
a chance to survive.

378
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,400
[The current situation]

379
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
[far exceeds our expectations.]

380
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,320
I have heard that General Zhenyuan

381
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,880
is known for his blood-thirst nature.

382
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,680
[With a hundred thousand troops,]

383
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,120
[the city will surely]

384
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
face destruction today.

385
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,600
Great suffering awaits the people!

386
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,520
[Greatness never]

387
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,920
comes from indecision!

388
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,440
Lord Mo, Master

389
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,760
sent me to deliver a message to you.

390
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,840
This is the crucial moment

391
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
for our great cause.

392
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,360
Do not let mercy

393
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
cloud your judgment.

394
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,040
[The Fire Moth Sect]

395
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,400
[has always been ruthless,]

396
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,880
[ready to betray anyone at any moment.]

397
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,120
[Are you really willing to gamble]

398
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,880
[with the lives of]

399
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
[these innocent citizens?]

400
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,240
[Lord Mo has dedicated himself]

401
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
[to Yingzhou and its people,]

402
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,640
yet he's been framed by the treacherous.

403
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,240
We must stand by Lord Mo!

404
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,440
Defend the city!

405
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,800
Stand by Lord Mo!

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,240
Defend the city!

407
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,680
Stand by Lord Mo!

408
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,120
Defend the city!

409
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,640
Stand by Lord Mo!

410
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,080
Defend the city!

411
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,760
Stand by Lord Mo!

412
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,360
Defend the city!

413
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,880
Stand by Lord Mo!

414

[You are a good official,]

415
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,880
[a great brother.]

[You are the]

[kindest soul I know.]

418
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,920
In the end,

419
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,640
it is I who have failed Yingzhou...

420
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,880
[Stand by Lord Mo!]

421
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
[Defend the city!]

422
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,160
[Stand by Lord Mo!]

423
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
[Defend the city!]

424
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,400
[Stand by Lord Mo!]

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,280
[Defend the city!]

426
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,200
Shen Du!

427
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,200
[I, Mo Qianzhi,]

428
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,840
challenge you to a duel!

429
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,360
[You and I have finally come to this.]

430
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,520
The martial arts you mastered as a child

431
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,560
were taught by me.

432
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
In the past,

433
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
you have never bested me.

434
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
You picked up this technique

435
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,440
with surprising speed!

436
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,640
With dedication and practice,

437
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,920
one can achieve remarkable progress.

438
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,840
One day,

439
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
I will defeat you!

440
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,160
Then you better catch up,

441
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
for I am determined to become

442
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,080
the greatest general of the empire,

443
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,080
to charge across the battlefield and serve

444
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,440
my country with unwavering loyalty.

445
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,840
This time,

446
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,640
I will emerge victorious!

447
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,480
What should we do?

448
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,280
Qianzhi...

449
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,600
It seems I have indeed aged,

450
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,280
my reflexes can't keep up with yours.

451
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,040
Protect Lord Mo!

452
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,920
You challenged me to a duel

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,800
because you can't stand to see

454
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,320
the people of Yingzhou suffer, correct?

455
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,040
Open the gate!

456
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,280
No need for war, wonderful!

457
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,280
What a clever ruse!

458
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,040
Du,

459
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,720
you have truly made

460
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
great strides over the years.

461
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,800
[You have won!]

462
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
If you had observed with a clear mind,

463
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,000
you might have seen through this trick.

464
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,080
What I wagered on

465
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
was your reluctance to risk

466
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,320
the lives of all the citizens of Yingzhou.

467
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,080
Thus,

468
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,240
you have not truly lost.

469
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,280
When will the reinforcements arrive?

470
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,160
Tomorrow.

471
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,520
Then how will you

472
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,480
explain everything?

473
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,680
Mo Qianzhi's been manipulated by the cult,

474
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,680
overestimating his own strength.

475
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,280
Yingzhou's military strength

476
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
is severely lacking.

477
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,320
There are still many citizens in the city

478
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,920
who believe you are being used

479
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
and manipulated by the Fire Moth Sect.

480
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,680
They are still pleading for you.

481
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,320
[Tell me,]

482
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,200
how do you contact with the leader

483
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,480
of the Fire Moth Sect?

484
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,560
All that laugh, like moths drawn to the flame.

485
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,640
Moths that brave the fire do not perish,

486
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,280
[but are reborn anew.]

487
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,760
The notion of resurrection is a fallacy.

488
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,080
[God cherishes all lives.]

489
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,720
Even mayflies that live for a day

490
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,360
have their place

491
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,560
in the cycle of reincarnation.

492
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,720
How could they not enter the cycle?

493
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,240
Moths into the fire will turn to ashes,

494
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,400
unable to enter the cycle,

495
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,120
how could they ever be reborn?

496
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,760
The one you contacted,

497
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
was it Chen Huo'e?

498
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,080
I warned you long ago

499
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,320
not to get involved.

500
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,960
You didn't realize the depth of the

501
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,360
situation and insisted on forging ahead.

502
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,160
[In truth, I never reported the]

503
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,520
[chaos caused by the masked spectres;]

504
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,840
someone was posing as me.

505
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,600
From the very start,

506
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,480
you were ensnared in someone else's plot.

507
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,600
What is this man's true intention?

508
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Until I meet the Queen

509
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
in Xiang'an,

510
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,040
I will remain silent.

511
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,440
Regardless of what happened,

512
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,720
you are always like a brother to me.

513
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,880
Lady Yan!

514
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,600
Lady Yan!

515
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,280
Lady Yan!

516
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,000
Xiu.

517
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,800
Lady Yan!

518
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Why are you here?

519
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,920
Does Mo Qianzhi have to die?

520
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,800
Once we arrive in Xiang'an,

521
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,600
Her Majesty will make the decision.

522
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,080
It's a long journey ahead;

523
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,240
would it be OK if I gave him some food?

524
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,200
Rest assured,

525
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,200
we will take good care of him

526
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,080
along the way.

527
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
No matter what,

528
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
[it was Qianzhi]

529
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,560
[who named me.]

530
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,400
You didn't come

531
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,440
here just for this, right?

532
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,840
I'm begging you,

533
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,520
please help me.

534
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,640
I'm sorry about all this.

535
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,320
Jing Lin!

536
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
I must see Mo Qianzhi!

537
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,200
I'm not like those girls

538
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,000
who were meant to be sacrificed.

539
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,400
[I've known for a long time]

540
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,720
[what Qianzhi planned to do.]

541
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,320
I did it of my own accord.

542
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
Xiu,

543
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,800
please stop.

544
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,400
You shouldn't be here.

545
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,800
Leave.

546
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,600
Xing.

547
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,200
Don't come any closer!

548
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,120
I just wanted to see you

549
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,280
and have a few words with you.

550
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
[Speaking of which,]

551
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,839
the days when Qianzhi was with me

552
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,000
were the happiest

553
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and most fulfilling days of my life.

554
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,440
Without you,

555
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,680
I would have perished long ago.

556
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,920
[Thank you for giving me a name.]

557
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,440
[Xiu,]

558
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,000
what a lovely name!

559
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,680
Xiu...

560
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
But I know

561
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,160
that every time you call

562
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,360
her name,

563
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,800
it feels so profoundly different.

564
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,840
[I understand]

565
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,600
that deep down,

566
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,640
what you truly desire

567
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,080
has always been one thing:

568
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,840
to bring

569
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,640
Xiuxiu back to life.

570
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,640
Qianzhi,

571
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,760
farewell.

572
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,240
Xiu!

573
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,800
[Xiu!]

574
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,320
[Xiu!]

575
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,160
Qianzhi,

576
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,400
[Xiuxiu is here for me.]

577
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,280
Xiu!

578
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,200
Why are you so impulsive?

579
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,000
Du!

580
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,440
Have everyone else step back.

581
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,880
Come here,

582
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,840
I need to talk to you.

583
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,840
Du,

584
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
I knew you got out of the Custodial Ward,

585
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,560
[and I've heard you've become]

586
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,760
[the commander of the Imperial Guard.]

587
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,040
[I've also heard you've become]

588
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,280
[cold-hearted and ruthless.]

589
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,840
But I'm genuinely happy for you.

590
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,080
You're the last survivor of the Shens.

591
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,720
If you were still gentle and naive,

592
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,920
how could you possibly avenge master

593
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,840
and the rest of the Shen Family?

594
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,480
After establishing the Imperial Guard,

595
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,360
I have been diligently investigating.

596
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,120
On the surface,

597
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,680
the evidence in the Shens' case

598
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,600
appears irrefutable.

599
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,760
Yet I still uncovered

600
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,680
some suspicious details.

601
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,240
The events could not possibly have been

602
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,200
orchestrated by a single person.

603
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,960
Master was inherently modest,

604
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,160
always seeking to avoid court intrigues.

605
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,480
[His only concern was for the people.]

606
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,520
Regardless of who it was in power,

607
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,400
he simply did what he believed was right.

608
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,840
Peace for the people was his only wish.

609
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,320
[His very wish]

610
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,480
[offended the interests of many.]

611
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,520
The Majesty,

612
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,720
to whom you are devoted,

613
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,880
desired nothing less than his submission.

614
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,720
The ones responsible for the Shens' demise

615
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,160
were the Zhou Family.

616
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,000
I will definitely get to the bottom

617
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,440
of what happened back then.

618
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,200
No matter how many years it takes,

619
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,560
no matter who I will cross,

620
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,840
I will seek justice

621
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,280
from them one by one.

622
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,840
To bring peace to the souls

623
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,640
of the dozens who died unjustly.

624
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,880
Du,

625
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,480
I never thought

626
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,120
that you and I would find ourselves

627
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,000
at odds due to the same hatred.

628
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,960
Should you ever have your revenge,

629
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,640
remember to light an incense in my memory.

630
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,240
When I journey to the afterlife,

631
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,680
I will finally find peace...

632
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,840
Qianzhi!

633
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,480
[Qianzhi!]

634
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,840
I left something

635
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,440
for you in

636
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,680
Xiu's portrait.

637
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,080
Qianzhi...

638
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,000
Gosh!

639
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,840
Retribution has arrived!

640
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,680
Right after Lord Mo's departure,

641
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,120
this bizarre incident occurred.

642
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,440
This is divine retribution!

643
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,960
It's poisoning.

644
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,640
Move aside!

645
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,600
Lord Shen,

646
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,520
there have been several reports

647
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,920
of this strange phenomenon in the city.

648
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,400
It's truly alarming.

649
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,520
Over thirty citizens have been affected.

650
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,560
If this continues,

651
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,960
we're bound to face chaos.

652
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,360
This is the work of the Fire Moth Sect.

653
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,280
[If we can't find a solution...]

654
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,960
Then

655
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,720
the Fire Moth Sect could use this poison

656
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,200
to take down the entire city

657
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,120
without a single drop of bloodshed.

658
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,600
Although this poison is potent,

659
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,400
its effects are slow to manifest.

660
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,280
For now,

661
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,320
they are not in immediate danger.

662
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,640
I will find a way

663
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
to obtain the antidote.

664
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,280
Understood!

665
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,200
You take over.

666
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,280
Understood!

667
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,240
[I left something]

668
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,800
[for you in Xiu's portrait.]
