3
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
You're covered in bruises.

4
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,560
What on earth happened?

5
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,240
I tripped over something and fell.

6
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,640
If so, then Chief Shen

7
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,120
was being quite careless.

8
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,480
What I'm trying to say is,

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,280
he didn't take good care of you.

10
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
You know,

11
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,680
when women get beaten up at home,

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,480
they tend to say that.

13
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,200
Am I right?

14
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,880
Absolutely.

15
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Lord.

16
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,680
What happened to you?

17
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Step aside, step aside.

18
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
Please, sit down.

19
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,480
Take it easy.

20
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,680
What happened to you?

21
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
Where's your injury?

22
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
Easy, easy.

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,920
How did you get injured?

24
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
What happened?

25
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,280
I tripped.

26
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
What? You too?

27
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
Poker face!

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Poker face!

29
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,520
I just wanted to enjoy the play.

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
It was halfway through the play

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,760
when my father dragged me back.

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,320
It must have been that poker face!

33
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,360
You know,

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,320
was that poker face!

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,920
sent by Wu Taiming

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,160
to make us suffer?

37
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,680
What did I do

38
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,720
to upset him?

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
My father says,

40
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
there's no problem that

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
can't be solved with a gold ingot.

42
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
If one ingot isn't enough,

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,560
then make it two.

44
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,960
Chuichui.

45
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,800
Honestly, I can't help you with this.

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,560
Because Chichi

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
asked me to meet her

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
at Guangyue Restaurant today.

49
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,920
I have to go.

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,520
You fickle little toots.

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,160
Xing.

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
You can justify

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,640
by saying your head got bumped,

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,520
but how did you

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
hurt your leg?

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,600
Did the White Death trouble you?

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,640
No, no, not at all.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,200
I have to go.

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,680
Boss!

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
One pancake, please.

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,640
What a lovely day today!

62
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
Enjoy your pancake.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,039
Thanks. Put it on my tab.

64
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:40,680
Sure.

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,000
Lady Lu.

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,520
Poker face,

67
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,040
cut to the chase,

68
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,600
how much do you want?

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,560
What you gave me

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
is quite generous.

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
This way up.

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,080
Look over there.

73
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Chuichui!

74
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,280
Daddy,

75
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
can I have a gold ingot?

76
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
Sweetie,

77
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,400
there's no need for gold

78
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,880
to acquire a lad like him.

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
A string of copper coins would suffice.

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Take this.

81
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,280
No,

82
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,880
I want a gold ingot.

83
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,280
Miss,

84
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll be at your service now.

85
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,920
No need.

86
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,600
I have plenty of servants.

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
A man shouldn't spend his life

88
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,320
serving others.

89
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,480
He should do more meaningful things,

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
like protecting others.

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,520
Let's go.

92
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,160
[Chi,]

93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,640
[Our friendship comes from]

94
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,120
[many private letters.]

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,200
[Today, we finally get to meet.]

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,640
[I'm a bit nervous.]

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,040
[I wonder what kind of]

98
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,760
[fair and delicate]

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,800
[maiden are you?]

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,640
Miss,

101
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,920
Yan the Erudite fell ill.

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,400
Please head back to check on him.

103
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
[My father is unwell.]

104
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,320
[Talk later.]

105
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,800
[I hope you understand.]

106
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Father!

107
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,200
How are you, father?

108
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,240
It's truly a challenge to meet

109
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
Lady Yan these days.

110
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,200
Even more so

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
to get a few honest words

112
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,760
from Lady Yan.

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,920
My lord, I wouldn't dare.

114
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,000
You wouldn't dare?

115
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,520
You knew very well

116
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,680
I had you marry into the Shen Family

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,000
for a specific purpose.

118
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,320
Yet every day,

119
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,640
you keep bringing matters like

120
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
what Shen Du eats or drinks

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,120
to fool me.

122
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,960
My Lord,

123
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,160
I know once I come here,

124
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,600
I must share your burden

125
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,760
and keep watching Shen Du.

126
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,800
However, Xing is merely a

127
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,760
household woman

128
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,840
in the Shen residence.

129
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
What I could uncover

130
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,120
is limited to his daily meals.

131
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
Yet secret messages

132
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,080
come from details.

133
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,520
Xing fears missing anything,

134
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,880
so I must attend to every detail.

135
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,280
If my lord finds it's insufficient,

136
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
then next month's report

137
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,239
will include his daily routines,

138
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,320
bathing habits,

139
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,639
and intimate moments...

140
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,360
Shut it!

141
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,960
You, a young lady,

142
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,280
how could you be so indiscreet!

143
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,119
Yan the Erudite,

144
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,239
this is the fine girl

145
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,080
you've raised!

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,200
Apologies, prime minister.

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,840
Please forgive her.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,640
My fault for her bad manners.

149
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,320
I am to blame.

150
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,600
Xing was being incompetent,

151
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,720
unable to gather useful intelligence.

152
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
I beg for your forgiveness.

153
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
Please do not blame my father.

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,640
Xing,

155
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
I understand that

156
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
once a girl gets married,

157
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,240
she takes her husband as her world.

158
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,000
In her eyes and heart,

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,480
there's no one but him.

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,040
Even if she's wronged,

161
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,680
she has to endure it silently.

162
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,200
However,

163
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,600
what a woman fears most is having

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,720
a wolf in sheep's clothing by her side.

165
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,280
As for the case regarding the Shens,

166
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,520
it created quite a stir back then.

167
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,400
You were still quite young,

168
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,040
but you must have heard about it.

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
Do you know

170
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,200
who dealt the final blow

171
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,080
to the Shen Family?

172
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,320
It was Shen Du himself.

173
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,880
Chief Shen,

174
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
I have ascertained that

175
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,520
any case reviewed by Her Highness

176
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,680
for over ten years

177
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,320
has its evidence archived

178
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,760
within the Imperial Secretariat.

179
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
Imperial Secretariat?

180
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,160
But it's entrenched in power struggles,

181
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,880
and it has always been heavily guarded.

182
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Even we, the Imperial Guard,

183
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
may not approach it without just cause.

184
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,360
No worries.

185
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,240
As long as the items are there,

186
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,360
there will be a way to obtain them.

187
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,080
Yes.

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,760
Additionally,

189
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,360
my lady returned to the Yan residence tonight.

190
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
Coincidentally,

191
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
Prime minister Zhang also went there tonight,

192
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,920
and he didn't take his own carriage.

193
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,560
Instead, he used a regular sedan carriage.

194
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,840
Got it.

195
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,720
I'll wait outside, my lord.

196
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I hereby report!

197
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,800
The traitor Shen Bingzhu's son, Shen Du

198
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,840
accuses my father

199
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,840
of colluding with foreign powers

200
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,960
and committing treason!

201
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,280
I hereby report!

202
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,360
The traitor Shen Bingzhu's son, Shen Du

203
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,800
accuses my father

204
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
of colluding with foreign powers

205
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,360
and committing treason!

206
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,600
I hereby report!

207
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,400
The traitor Shen Bingzhu's son, Shen Du

208
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,680
accuses my father

209
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
of colluding with foreign powers

210
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,040
and committing treason!

211
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
[Chief Shen,]

212
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
[what's the point of mocking me?]

213
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,760
[Yes, I murdered my own kin,]

214
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
[but what about you?]

215
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,840
[You reported your own father.]

216
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,480
[You are no better than me.]

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,800
[Father!]

218
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
[I had no choice]

219
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
[but to take that path back then.]

220
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,760
[But now, as long as]

221
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,400
[I could enter the Imperial Secretariat,]

222
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
[I could obtain the]

223
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,240
[letters of treason.]

224
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,760
[Once proven to be forged, one more charge]

225
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,920
[against you will be diminished.]

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
[For the case of the Shen Family,]

227
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,840
[although the evidence was irrefutable,]

228
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,000
[Deputy Minister Shen claimed innocence]

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
[and refused to sign the testament.]

230
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
[Despite enduring torture,]

231
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,440
[he never confessed until his death.]

232
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,960
[The case was closed with only]

233
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,120
[physical evidence, no testimonies.]

234
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,800
[But who could have foreseen]

235
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,840
[that many years later,]

236
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,320
[with the young emperor on the throne,]

237
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,000
[and the Empress Dowager in control,]

238
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,920
[your esteemed husband Shen Du would]

239
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,840
[go to great lengths to climb the ranks,]

240
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,880
[even writing a confession]

241
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,240
[on behalf of his father,]

242
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,760
[acknowledging all the crimes]

243
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,120
[from that time.]

244
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,480
[Who is it?]

245
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,800
[It's me.]

246
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,880
[Your husband.]

247
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,440
[What are you up to?]

248
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,400
[Why are you covered in blood?]

249
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,920
[My darling,]

250
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,320
[do you want to know whose blood this is?]

251
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,800
[It's the blood of your entire Yan family,]

252
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,040
[over a dozen lives.]

253
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,040
[As a spy,]

254
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,000
[you deserve all this.]

255
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,320
[Are you truly]

256
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,280
[so cold-blooded and heartless?]

257
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,880
The porridge is quite good.

258
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,880
It's too sweet.

259
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,960
The side dishes are quite crunchy.

260
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,919
It's too salty.

261
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
I love this combo, so what?

262
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,080
Uncle Zhong,

263
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,520
for future breakfasts,

264
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,439
make salty porridge with sweet dishes.

265
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,520
Shen Du, what do you mean by this?

266
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,120
Nothing.

267
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,920
Shen Du,

268
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,360
is this truly your nature?

269
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,840
Is this truly the person you've become?

270
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,040
So what if it is?

271
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,840
And if it isn't, what then?

272
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,920
Yan Xing,

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
this is indeed my true nature.

274
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,600
Chief Shen,

275
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,200
it's really unfair to you.

276
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,760
That woman is not just unsettled,

277
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,080
but she's also a fierce one.

278
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,080
She pretended to behave

279
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,280
in the beginning, but just

280
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,080
a few days in, her true colors showed.

281
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,440
[You have your duties to attend to,]

282
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,240
[and I have mine to fulfill.]

283
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,840
[I must at least put on a show.]

284
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
[But I won't go too far.]

285
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,120
[Don't worry.]

286
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,640
Jinglin,

287
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,800
tell me,

288
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,080
"Chief Shen's wife got beaten up by husband"

289
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,440
or "White Death married a fierce woman."

290
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,680
Which one would excite

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,040
the noble ladies of Xiang'an City,

292
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,720
and make Lord Zhang and the likes

293
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,720
believe they could take advantage

294
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,160
of the situation?

295
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
It's been several days since the wedding.

296
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,800
Time for some gossip.

297
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,680
Are you suggesting

298
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,240
we deliberately let those

299
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,960
with ulterior motives believe

300
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,000
the Shen Family is unstable,

301
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,120
thereby lowering their guard?

302
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,480
You catch on quick.

303
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
So your argument with her today

304
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,240
was intentional?

305
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,120
Brilliant!

306
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,200
So my lady's injuries are

307
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,200
also part of your plan, right?

308
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,920
The Imperial Academy has always admitted

309
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,520
individuals of high status.

310
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
This time, admission is based on merit,

311
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,400
not recommendations or family status.

312
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,080
So how do they judge character?

313
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,440
Then it's about who writes better essays.

314
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,920
Those country bumpkins,

315
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,440
as long as they are willing to work hard,

316
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,120
and burn the midnight oil,

317
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,440
they might get lucky.

318
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,240
Once they enter the academy,

319
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,520
I wouldn't want to study alongside them.

320
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,640
Your Highness,

321
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,920
the examination at Imperial Academy is approaching.

322
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,920
It's the first time

323
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,360
we've lowered the bars for social status.

324
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,880
Scholars from humble backgrounds

325
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,240
with talents and skills

326
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,960
can all compete fairly.

327
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,840
This is of great significance.

328
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,240
Also, this time it's especially allowed

329
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,960
for students from Xichen and Nanlang

330
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,360
to take the exam as well.

331
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,400
Therefore,

332
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,040
every detail of this examination

333
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,760
must be handled meticulously.

334
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,880
Indeed,

335
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,600
Prime Minister Zhang is quite right.

336
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,000
This examination is unprecedented

337
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,800
and will affect the empire's reputation.

338
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,720
Lord Zhang, who would you recommend

339
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
for this crucial assignment?

340
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,400
His Highness, Prince Xian, his efforts

341
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
in disaster relief have been commendable.

342
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,040
The people have been singing his praises.

343
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,320
I believe

344
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
it would be wise to let him

345
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,880
take charge of the imperial examinations.

346
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,760
Everyone knows that Prince Xian

347
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,680
and Prime minister Zhang favor the gentry.

348
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,160
If you are in charge,

349
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,280
won't that mean humble families

350
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,600
will have no chance at all?

351
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Sister, there's a misunderstanding.

352
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,960
Princess Ying,

353
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,640
who do you think is more fit for the role?

354
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,520
I believe

355
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,520
Shen Du would be the best fit.

356
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,280
Your Highness,

357
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
when did you start to favor

358
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,600
Chief Shen?

359
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,320
Are you really suggesting

360
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,960
that Imperial Guard, a military branch

361
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,000
should oversee the examinations?

362
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,840
This is a misguided statement, Chancellor Lai.

363
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,360
Selecting the virtuous and capable is all

364
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
for the service of Her Royal Highness.

365
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,600
Although the exam is a literary test,

366
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,920
the relevant arrangements

367
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,280
require more than literary skills;

368
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,200
they also need strong leadership.

369
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
The Imperial Guard is always meticulous.

370
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,000
It'll surely manage everything properly.

371
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,280
The Imperial Guard

372
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,200
is at your service, Your Royal Highness.

373
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
We will do our utmost.

374
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,440
Your Royal Highness,

375
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,480
Chief Shen spends his days

376
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,160
arresting suspects and handling cases,

377
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
causing widespread anxiety.

378
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,160
Moreover, the Shen household

379
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
is embroiled in constant disputes,

380
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,880
showing no signs of family harmony.

381
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,720
If Shen Du is put in charge

382
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,960
of this imperial examination,

383
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,680
it would truly be

384
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,360
a disgrace to the royal family.

385
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,240
As for the matters of my household,

386
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
Prime Minister Zhang seems to know everything.

387
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,320
Enough,

388
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,760
about the examination,

389
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,080
let me think it through.

390
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,680
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

391
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,720
Who is it?

392
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,520
Caiwei!

393
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,000
Please get up!

394
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,880
Xing.

395
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,640
I am truly sorry.

396
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
Caiwei,

397
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
why are you back?

398
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Where is Mr. Han?

399
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,400
You've taken on the burden for me.

400
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,480
Mr. Han and I have

401
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,400
decided to return home to apologize.

402
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,440
But,

403
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,440
I fear going home.

404
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,640
So I had to

405
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,160
hide outside the Shen residence.

406
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,960
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,080
Caiwei,

408
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,520
stop blaming yourself.

409
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,600
Let's go home first.

410
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,200
Let's talk this out after we get home.

411
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,400
Yeah, that side.

412
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,280
Here, move it down a little.

413
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,320
Yes.

414
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,480
OK.

415
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,680
Oh, get down here, now!

416
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,160
Xing and Caiwei are back!

417
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,240
My lord, my lady!

418
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,240
Xing and Caiwei have returned!

419
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,200
My lord, my lady!

420
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
Xing and Caiwei have returned!

421
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,520
My lord, my lady!

422
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,520
Where is Caiwei?

423
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,160
That's right.

424
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,320
Xing and Caiwei have returned!

425
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,080
- Mother!
- Caiwei!

426
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,480
Caiwei, you're finally back!

427
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,320
You've worried me sick!

428
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,600
- Xing!
- Mother!

429
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,280
Oh, my poor little girl!

430
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,360
So the rumors are true!

431
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,280
The White Death

432
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,520
indeed beat you up!

433
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,200
Mother!

434
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,560
You took someone else's burden

435
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,240
with good intentions,

436
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,680
but those ungrateful people

437
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,880
have been living it up,

438
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,840
while my poor girl

439
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,200
has been tormented by

440
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,160
- the White Death.
- Mother, please stop!

441
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,360
No, I haven't.

442
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,000
- It's all my...
- Xing.

443
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,800
I was being selfish,

444
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
only thinking of myself.

445
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
Today, outside the Shen residence,

446
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,200
I heard them talk about

447
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,840
how you were insulted by the White Death.

448
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,280
I am in deep anguish to know that.

449
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,200
He even had the nerve to insult you!

450
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
We were...

451
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,480
insulting each other.

452
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
If something like this happens again,

453
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,840
I'll go all out for you,

454
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,880
and let's confront him together!

455
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,520
Mother, it really wasn't like that.

456
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
Everyone is here, huh?

457
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,040
Stop right here.

458
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,440
My sweet little sister,

459
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,640
I heard you got beat up

460
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,000
by the White Death.

461
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,160
Was it because

462
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,440
you were being clumsy

463
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,800
so you couldn't serve him properly?

464
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,560
- Your temper is also bad.
- Hey!

465
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,280
Pay attention to me! You little...

466
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,080
Caiwei?

467
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,240
It's really you, Caiwei!

468
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,760
Shut your mouth!

469
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,400
Didn't you run away with someone?

470
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
You reek of alcohol,

471
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,400
staying out all night.

472
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,040
This is unacceptable!

473
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,280
- Unacceptable!
- Father!

474
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,960
- My lord!
- Unacceptable!

475
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,400
My lord!

476
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,440
Get back to your room!

477
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,400
Stop, please!

478
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,560
Father, I just remembered.

479
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,720
On my way back,

480
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,680
I think I saw the White Death

481
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,840
leading a group of guardsmen

482
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,120
heading towards our residence.

483
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,680
Will they arrest someone, I wonder?

484
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,640
Greetings, Chief Shen.

485
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,840
Chief Shen.

486
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,840
Shen Du.

487
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,120
It's all my fault,

488
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,680
and it has nothing to do with Xing.

489
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,960
Just take it out on me.

490
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
Who are you?

491
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,440
Yan Caiwei?

492
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
Take her away!

493
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,520
Chief Shen,

494
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,280
I fully understand the marriage

495
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,040
between the Shen and Yan families

496
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,560
has caused some discomfort for you.

497
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
I also feel a sense of guilt.

498
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,640
However, the marriage between you and Xing

499
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,960
has already been established.

500
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
I hope you could

501
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,040
show some leniency for the sake

502
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,840
of this union, Chief Shen.

503
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,400
Take Yan Xing

504
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,320
away as well!

505
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,680
Both of them, Chief Shen?

506
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,760
Please don't!

507
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,560
Don't you touch them!

508
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,280
I, Yan Mojie, am here,

509
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,160
and don't you lay a finger on us!

510
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,360
The White Death,

511
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,320
do you really believe

512
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,120
you are from hell?

513
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,360
So you could just

514
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,480
take anyone as you please?

515
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,680
Where's the justice in this?

516
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
Shut your mouth!

517
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,320
This pig

518
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,840
is obstructing official business.

519
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,960
Take it away!

520
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,720
Chief Shen!

521
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,640
Chief Shen!

522
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,280
Mercy, Chief Shen!

523
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,480
Please don't take them, Chief Shen!

524
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,560
Chief Shen, please!

525
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,600
Have some mercy, my lord!

526
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,440
- Caiwei! Xing!
- Chief Shen!

527
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,680
Chief Shen, please!

528
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,280
Chief Shen.

529
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,560
Shen Du,

530
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,040
what exactly do you want?

531
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,240
Yan Caiwei,

532
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,320
where is Han Shiyuan?

533
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,680
I...

534
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,920
I don't know.

535
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,840
He is now a murder suspect.

536
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,160
Are you sure you want to cover for him?

537
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,840
What?

538
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,760
My lady, you didn't

539
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,840
show up at the Ministry of Justice today,

540
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,720
so you may not know.

541
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,960
In a well at the Imperial Academy,

542
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,520
the body of a student was discovered.

543
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,400
This case involves

544
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,160
students from the Imperial Academy,

545
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
which agitated Her Royal Highness.

546
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,000
Her Royal Highness ordered

547
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,400
the Imperial Guard to investigate.

548
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,920
And currently, the prime suspect

549
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,040
is Han Shiyuan.

550
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,680
Impossible!

551
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,520
He would never commit murder!

552
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,840
Do you think Han Shiyuan was

553
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,280
running away with you for love?

554
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,920
But the evidence shows he was fleeing

555
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,960
for fear of being charged with murder.

556
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,520
How could this be happening?

557
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,480
This is simply impossible!

558
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,120
Caiwei,

559
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,680
you genuinely don't know

560
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,120
where Han Shiyuan is?

561
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,240
He must show up

562
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,920
to prove his innocence.

563
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,480
As soon as we returned to Xiang'an,

564
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,160
he disappeared.

565
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,000
I...

566
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,920
I truly don't know.

567
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,720
I really have no idea.

568
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
May I take a look

569
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,240
at the body of the deceased?

570
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,200
There are no signs of drowning

571
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,600
in the mouth and nose,

572
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,920
so we can rule out suicide by drowning.

573
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,840
The corpse shows multiple bruises,

574
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,040
indicating signs of a struggle.

575
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,800
The estimated time of death

576
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,720
was probably a month ago.

577
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,560
My lady, the time of death

578
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,840
should be around the seventh of May.

579
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,680
Thank you.

580
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,040
Your coroner is truly remarkable

581
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,920
and able to deduce such precise details.

582
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm quite impressed.

583
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,800
It seems that

584
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,680
I still have much to learn

585
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,600
from all of you.

586
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,160
My lady

587
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,880
and her

588
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,200
whining sister

589
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,560
are truly different.

590
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,240
Why are you all standing so far away?

591
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,760
Are you worried the body might decompose

592
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,840
and suddenly burst open?

593
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,600
Don't worry.

594
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
The decomposition isn't

595
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,640
at that stage yet.

596
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,520
This is just too unusual.

597
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,760
Is there any other evidence?

598
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,600
We also retrieved

599
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,600
a piece of clothing

600
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,760
and a scroll from the well.

601
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
Upon examination,

602
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,040
the clothing belongs to Han Shiyuan,

603
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,080
and the scroll

604
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
was left by the instructor

605
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,240
as a quiz

606
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
at the Imperial Academy on the seventh.

607
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,840
Thus,

608
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
the date of death

609
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,160
is inferred from this evidence.

610
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,160
The information about the deceased

611
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,800
is gathered through more than

612
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,920
just the coroner's examination.

613
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,400
The Imperial Guard is on duty!

614
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,760
Where is Han Shiyuan?

615
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,280
I don't know.

616
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,920
Hey, you!

617
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,560
Where is Han Shiyuan?

618
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,400
I don't know either.

619
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,440
No one knows, huh?

620
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,800
Jinglin!

621
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,760
Is this how you conduct investigation?

622
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,560
Are you trying to force a confession?

623
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,760
They are almost scared to death!

624
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,000
Get out of here!

625
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,360
I almost got it! I...

626
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,560
Let me do the talking.

627
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,720
My lady must have forgotten that

628
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,520
she's also in a uniform.

629
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,960
He was quite introverted

630
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,480
and didn't interact much with us.

631
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,200
May I ask,

632
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,600
have you seen Han Shiyuan

633
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,920
in recent days?

634
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,720
The last time I saw Han Shiyuan

635
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,080
was in the evening of the seventh of May.

636
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,720
That day, I passed by his room and saw him

637
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,120
saying goodbye to his classmates,

638
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,200
and then he left.

639
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,880
Seventh of May, evening.

640
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,080
How can you be so sure?

641
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,800
He went west when he left.

642
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
I was just about to greet him,

643
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
but when I turned around,

644
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,960
I saw the firelight in the east.

645
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,400
Then I heard about

646
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,120
the fire at the Ming Hall.

647
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,000
That's why I remember.

648
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,920
Han Shiyuan is one of the most

649
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,600
good looking students in our academy.

650
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,480
He doesn't interact much with others.

651
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,520
By the way,

652
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,480
you can ask

653
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,760
his roommate, Lan Guizhou.

654
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,600
But Lan Guizhou is a man

655
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,000
who is always reserved and gloomy.

656
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,720
He only speaks to Han Shiyuan.

657
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,400
Are you Lan Guizhou?

658
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,400
I am Lan Guizhou.

659
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,360
On the seventh of May,

660
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,680
did you see Han Shiyuan?

661
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,440
I did.

662
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,120
Shiyuan mentioned that

663
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,800
he was leaving Xiang'an to get married.

664
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,200
After saying his farewells, he went west.

665
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Alright, thank you.

666
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,640
Lady!

667
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Lady!

668
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,239
Is there anything I can assist with?

669
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,560
You are just everywhere, aren't you?

670
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,360
I'm here to collect

671
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,840
the pawned items from the students.

672
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,799
Investigating a case

673
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:41,000
requires getting involved

674
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
just like my lady does.

675
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,000
The way my lady investigates

676
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,759
is truly something to behold!

677
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,640
When will I be able to

678
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,040
apprentice under her

679
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
and follow her in investigations?

680
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,400
Lady!

681
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,680
No one

682
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,480
is allowed to disturb clerk Yan

683
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,600
while she focuses on the investigation.

684
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,240
What's on your mind?

685
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,800
I just feel something is off.

686
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,160
Anything wrong with the evidence?

687
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,280
No.

688
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,600
But it's precisely because there isn't any

689
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,680
that I find it a bit strange.

690
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,400
It's too perfect.

691
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,680
Look. Take a look.

692
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,600
Eyewitnesses and evidence are too complete

693
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,400
to the point that it feels a bit contrived.

694
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,120
Investigations can't solely rely on hunch.

695
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,840
I only trust evidence.

696
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
Me too.

697
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,760
But what if the evidence is fabricated?

698
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,080
Look here.

699
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,680
And here.

700
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,680
What are you doing?

701
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,160
It's too dark.

702
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,440
It's not dark at all, alright?

703
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,240
This room is practically bright as day!

704
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
I find it blinding, honestly!

705
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,200
Let's see the physical evidence first.

706
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,720
There are scrolls and pieces of clothing.

707
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,840
These two pieces of evidence

708
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
seem to be trying to ensure

709
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,960
that Han Shiyuan is implicated.

710
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,760
That clothing from Han Shiyuan,

711
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,080
the color is so distinct.

712
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,360
If it were torn,

713
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,840
how could it not be noticed?

714
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,600
And check this out,

715
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,160
these two students as witnesses

716
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,640
both said they saw Han Shiyuan

717
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
on the night of the seventh of May,

718
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,000
and they were very certain.

719
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,400
But that day was our wedding day.

720
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,960
Caiwei and Han Shiyuan

721
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
had already run away on the sixth of May.

722
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,720
They might have run away just to

723
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,840
avoid your Yan Family.

724
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,640
Perhaps, on the seventh of May,

725
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,200
they were still in the city,

726
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,080
watching you idiot get married.

727
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,640
No way.

728
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Caiwei and Han Shiyuan

729
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
had already left the city

730
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
before our wedding.

731
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,240
You trust her so much.

732
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,920
Then why did she let you take her place?

733
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,800
Caiwei...

734
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
had no choice either.

735
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,560
Who would want to marry

736
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,520
you, the White Death?

737
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh really?

738
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,080
Then you should leave.

739
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,840
Hell doesn't welcome you either.

740
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Fine by me.

741
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,440
Good, good!

742
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,240
Bravo!

743
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,320
Great, great!

744
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,760
Wonderful!

745
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,560
Do it again!

746
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,200
Bravo!

747
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,040
Here it comes!

748
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,640
The hanging ghost comes to kill!

749
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,280
Here it comes!

750
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,720
The hanging ghost is coming!

751
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,280
Good!

752
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,480
Good!

753
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,400
Look!

754
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,360
Bust!

755
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,480
The ghost has been busted!

756
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,720
The ghost has been busted!

757
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,680
So magical!

758
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,480
Incredible!

759
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,640
Good, good.

760
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,520
I don't have any magical powers.

761
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,560
This is just

762
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,480
the most ordinary sleight of hand.

763
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,160
I'm operating the mechanism inside,

764
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
pulling it down.

765
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,360
What appears on this white cloth

766
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,680
is the image going up.

767
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,880
Everyone, remember,

768
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
if in the future

769
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,640
someone claims to use this technique

770
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,040
to catch ghosts,

771
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,680
that person must be a con artist.

772
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,440
So that's how it is.

773
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,200
Now I understand.

774
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,680
You revealed the trick just like that.

775
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,840
Aren't you afraid of ruining your peers'

776
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,000
livelihoods? They might cause you trouble.

777
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Mozi said,

778
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,760
the view manifests,

779
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,520
come noon it takes shape and extends;

780
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,640
the essence rests in its form.

781
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,920
This is a principle known

782
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
by the ancients for thousands of years.

783
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,400
So anyone who reads

784
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,200
should be familiar with it.

785
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,360
Therefore, it is not a secret.

786
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,320
It should not be used to deceive

787
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,600
the common folks.

788
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
You, sir,

789
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,760
are quite interesting.

790
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,000
Although you make a living in the market,

791
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,040
you are a scholar with integrity.

792
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,000
I just heard that the Imperial Academy

793
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,880
accepts students

794
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
regardless of background,

795
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,440
so I came to join the fun.

796
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,080
I see.

797
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,160
I wish you success in getting enrolled.

798
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,040
I usually enjoy reading casual books,

799
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,360
but when it comes to classics,

800
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,880
I can't really get into them.

801
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,800
So

802
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,680
I'm afraid I won't be able to meet

803
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,040
the standards of the Imperial Academy.

804
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,960
I could only make a living

805
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,080
in this night market.

806
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,960
You're being overly modest, sir.

807
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,320
I see you have quite a bit of knowledge

808
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,440
about this light and shadow technique.

809
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,040
I actually have a matter

810
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,240
I wish to inquire about.

811
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,640
My lady, you are being overly humble.

812
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,600
Just call me Pan.

813
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,360
If you have any questions,

814
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,280
feel free to ask, my fair lady.

815
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,840
Whether it's self-defense techniques

816
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,280
or ways to manage a husband,

817
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,040
I know a thing or two.

818
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,680
I don't need those.

819
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,880
About your mechanism,

820
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,200
there are no ghosts inside,

821
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,600
yet it seems as if there are.

822
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Do you know if there's a way

823
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,240
to make it seem like someone is inside,

824
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,560
while there's actually no one.

825
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,280
And the people outside

826
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,640
think they see someone?

827
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,720
In this world, there are no ghosts,

828
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,800
and no one knows

829
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,200
what ghosts really look like.

830
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,880
But living people are different.

831
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,320
People have different appearances.

832
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,320
To disguise oneself,

833
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,480
is not easy at all.

834
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,720
Exactly.

835
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,080
My fair lady,

836
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,160
why don't you elaborate on

837
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,040
your question?

838
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,440
For example, the time,

839
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,200
the light,

840
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
the orientation in the room,

841
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,520
or the appearances of people

842
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,360
inside and outside the room, and so on.

843
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,680
OK.

844
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
Bravo!

845
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,400
What are you doing in here?

846
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,840
I found the proof.

847
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,280
Han Shiyuan is innocent.

848
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,280
What proof?

849
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,960
Come with me to the academy tonight.

850
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,600
You'll catch the culprit right there.
