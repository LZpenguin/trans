3
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
Lord Commander, please.

4
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,880
Why are you here, exactly?

5
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,200
So many lanterns. So bright in here.

6
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,920
Over here.

7
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,320
Put it here.

8
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,800
Is this how it usually is at your place?

9
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,960
Far brighter.

10
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,040
Lord Commander, here.

11
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,840
Mr. Han,

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,600
on such a full moon night,

13
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
do you also think of

14
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
your family like I do?

15
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,080
I...

16
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,400
My parents died at young age.

17
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,480
[I have no family left.]

18
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
Once I marry Caiwei,

19
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
the Yans will be my family.

20
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,480
Right, right.

21
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,240
Parents gone,

22
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,560
what about your siblings?

23
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
Regarding marriage,

24
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,040
out of courtesy,

25
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,880
shouldn't you inform them?

26
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,400
Before the wedding,

27
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
the two families should meet.

28
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,240
That's right.

29
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,000
No need for that.

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,440
I left home to study at a young age.

31
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,120
I've long lost contact with my relatives.

32
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
[As long as we truly love each other,]

33
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,840
that's enough.

34
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,320
[As for formalities,]

35
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
they don't matter to me.

36
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,880
Is that so?

37
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,040
I can't help but feel

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,240
that these formalities

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,640
are quite necessary.

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
Even if you're truly in love,

41
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,680
you should still hope to

42
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,720
gain recognition and blessings

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,080
from each other's family and friends.

44
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,120
[More importantly,]

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,360
this will help you have a clear

46
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,080
understanding of your background

47
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,320
and avoid any deception.

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
That's true.

49
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,720
But actually, my marriage wasn't

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
hindered by such formalities.

51
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
What matters the most is that Mr. Han

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
is deeply devoted to my sister.

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,240
[It's getting late,]

54
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,080
[and a bit chilly.]

55
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,880
How about

56
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,120
we all head back to our rooms?

57
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,480
Yes.

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,760
We shall take our leave.

59
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,560
Right, right.

60
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,960
[Lord Commander,]

61
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,560
we'll head back now.

62
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,880
Let's go.

63
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,880
Mr. Han.

64
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,720
Should your love be sincere

65
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
and reciprocated,

66
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,000
[there is no need to dread openness.]

67
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,840
You should face the future together.

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,840
My love,

69
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,600
let's go.

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
What exactly do you want?

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,720
Why did you have to snack here

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
and scare everyone off?

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
I really didn't want it either.

74
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,880
Even though it had to be said,

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
I shouldn't have been the one to say it.

76
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,960
C'mon,

77
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,440
stop it.

78
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,160
You're just

79
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,720
willfully confusing!

80
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,440
It's getting late.

81
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
Let's head back.

82
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,720
It's so late. Do we need to go back?

83
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,960
[Lord Commander.]

84
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,840
Sir.

85
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,040
We've prepared a bedroom

86
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,160
for both of you.

87
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
Such

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
being the case...

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,360
I won't go back.

90
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,040
Please feel free to leave, my love.

91
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,200
What are you doing?

92
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,400
What?

93
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
He said that a room

94
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,880
has been prepared for us.

95
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
If only you stay,

96
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
how are you going to explain tomorrow?

97
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,360
You want to stay as well, fine.

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
Just put me down!

99
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,120
It wouldn't be proper if someone saw us.

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,400
So what?

101
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,440
I want them to see.

102
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,280
To confirm our harmonious marriage.

103
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,920
That way, you won't have to explain.

104
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,840
Hey.

105
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
Let's go to sleep.

106
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,880
Alright, alright.

107
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,000
Now that the show is over,

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
it's time to sleep.

109
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,080
Here is not like your place.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,040
You'll have to make do tonight.

111
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,000
Just bear with it.

112
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm someone with wounds.

113
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,440
Sleeping on a bamboo chair

114
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,560
isn't appropriate, right?

115
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
It was you who...

116
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,040
You look even healthier than I do.

117
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,879
Never mind.

118
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
You can have the bed.

119
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,120
If you're willing to share,

120
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,080
there's still half a space here.

121
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,200
You can sleep in there.

122
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
[If you are not,]

123
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,880
you could go outside

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,480
and sleep with the stars all night.

125
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,040
Let's leave it at that for tonight.

126
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,320
Just make do.

127
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,680
But the necessary rules

128
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,600
must still be followed.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,720
No one is allowed

130
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,840
[to cross this line.]

131
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,960
I can't sleep.

132
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,920
I might as well go out and

133
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,400
share the night with the stars and moon.

134
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,920
Why are you coming out?

135
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,520
I've already given you the room.

136
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,480
The candles in the room are out.

137
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
It's too dark for me to sleep.

138
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,840
You should have someone

139
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
light the candles.

140
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,840
Shen Du,

141
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,080
it's the middle of the night,

142
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,680
are you trying to disturb everyone?

143
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,760
You weren't asleep either

144
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,880
when the candles were lit, right?

145
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,040
Tossing and turning,

146
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
it made it hard for me to sleep.

147
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,880
Even the candles were lit,

148
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,680
it's not bright enough.

149
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,080
Still a bit dim.

150
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,040
You're really quite strange.

151
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,720
My father even specially

152
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,920
lit a few more candles tonight.

153
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,880
You still think it's dark?

154
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,760
You're going to sleep,

155
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,840
not studying or writing.

156
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,560
Why does it have to be so brightly lit?

157
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,960
It's not like you're blind and can't see.

158
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,320
[Now I understand]

159
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
[why Shen Du is called White Death.]

160
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,520
[Look at this place,]

161
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,920
[it's like a mourning hall during the day.]

162
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
[At night,]

163
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
[it's still as bright as day.]

164
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
[Who brings a lantern]

165
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,240
[to kick some ass?]

166
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,280
[I can't do it without light.]

167
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,360
[Could it be that he's been]

168
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,240
[cursed with the moonless sight?]

169
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,800
Tonight is truly rare.

170
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,320
Look, the

171
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,800
Azure Dragon's Seven Stars in the east.

172
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
And

173
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,280
the Vermilion Bird's Seven Stars in the south.

174
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,280
You can see them all.

175
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,440
Look over there.

176
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,000
Those four stars are connected.

177
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
Do they like the four corners of a square?

178
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Those four over there

179
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,560
are the Dituhe constellation.

180
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
There are four more below,

181
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,440
which are the Horned Serpent Stars.

182
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,200
[Indeed, he can't really see.]

183
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
[There are no stars at all.]

184
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,080
You know so much

185
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,280
about the names of these stars.

186
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
You're quite impressive.

187
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
What about that one over there?

188
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,240
Looks like a rabbit.

189
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,520
What's that one called?

190
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,280
That's called the Celestial Crow.

191
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,560
What about this one here?

192
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,400
[I think it looks like]

193
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
a flower cake.

194
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
And the one in the south,

195
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
[it looks like]

196
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,640
the outline of a

197
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,760
cherry.

198
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,200
It's called the Jingmu'an.

199
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,760
That doesn't sound nice.

200
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,680
Let's change its name.

201
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,920
I think

202
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,640
we should call it

203
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
Cherry Stuffed Bread.

204
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,360
Next to it is

205
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
the Flower Cake.

206
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,800
It's better, how?

207
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,040
Such strange names.

208
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
And they're all pastries.

209
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,800
You wouldn't understand,

210
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,680
but naming them after food is better.

211
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
When I was little, I had a poor appetite,

212
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
so my mother gave the stars in the sky

213
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,440
names of pastries.

214
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
[She led me to believe that the]

215
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,080
[stars' shine signaled more pastry eating.]

216
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,840
Otherwise,

217
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,520
that star

218
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,840
would never shine again.

219
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,120
[Today,]

220
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
[you need to eat more flower cakes.]

221
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,280
[Because today, the star that looks like]

222
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,200
[a flower cake is shining.]

223
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,520
[My mother said,]

224
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,280
[if you don't eat it,]

225
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
[that star]

226
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,480
[will go out.]

227
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,720
[Help yourself.]

228
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,439
What are you doing?

229
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,679
[Could she be]

230
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,600
[you?]

231
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,880
Sir.

232
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
What's the matter?

233
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,200
Mr. Han went to see

234
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,360
Lord Yan earlier,

235
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,760
saying that he's gonna say something.

236
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,680
[He asked me]

237
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,440
[to invite you both to join them.]

238
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,680
Okay!

239
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,960
We will be there.

240
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,800
[Lord Commander.]

241
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,600
No formalities.

242
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,000
Greetings,

243
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,760
Lord Commander.

244
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,720
[Thank you for giving me]

245
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,280
chance to be honest with myself.

246
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,760
My love,

247
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,680
what exactly do you want to say?

248
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,880
Caiwei,

249
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,320
[I lied to you.]

250
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,160
My parents still have one son living.

251
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,120
He's a confidant of Her Royal Highness and

252
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,560
serves as the Deputy Minister of Rites,

253
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
Zhang Baohuan.

254
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
Lord Zhang?

255
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,960
But there's one thing I don't understand.

256
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,360
Since you are Lord Zhang's brother,

257
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,560
then why doesn't he

258
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,960
use his resources to protect you

259
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,760
from the persecution of Princess Ying?

260
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,960
Brother?

261
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
Princess Ying, having discovered

262
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,400
[our relationship,]

263
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,160
[wished to enlist me as her courtier,]

264
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,240
[motivated by a wish to]

265
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,480
challenge the Great Grandmother.

266
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,960
I have repeatedly refused,

267
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,240
[but it's hard to escape.]

268
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,480
[Although we are siblings,]

269
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,440
he is unworthy of being my brother.

270
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,280
He didn't save my sister.

271
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,480
Sister?

272
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,760
The owner of Jinxiu Workshop

273
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,200
was your sister, Zhang Baoying?

274
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,800
Caiwei,

275
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm sorry.

276
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,280
I lied to you.

277
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,000
[Back when the incident happened,]

278
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,040
[our whole family was exterminated.]

279
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,520
[Zhang Baohuan used his connections]

280
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,400
to save me.

281
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,280
I have always wondered,

282
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,080
he saved me already,

283
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,040
how come he couldn't save my sister?

284
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,400
[I hate him for not being able to save her.]

285
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,680
[I also hate myself for being powerless.]

286
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,280
[At that time,]

287
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,040
I made up my mind

288
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to cut ties with the Zhang Family.

289
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,880
My mother's surname is Han.

290
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,400
I took her surname, and

291
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,800
changed my name to Han Shiyuan.

292
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,720
Your brother may also

293
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,080
have unavoidable difficulties.

294
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,360
You should know

295
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,120
[how difficult it is for him]

296
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,240
[to stay by Her Royal Highness' side.]

297
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,200
Serving the monarch is like serving a tiger.

298
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,680
You should be

299
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,320
well aware of this.

300
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
Without witnessing the bloodshed,

301
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,360
how could you possibly

302
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,640
understand the pain?

303
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,520
Don't be afraid.

304
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,440
I will never forget that day.

305
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,040
[If you were me,]

306
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,680
you wouldn't be able to say such things.

307
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,240
You're wrong.

308
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,880
[It's precisely 'cause they died unjustly]

309
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,160
that you should rely on yourself more.

310
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,160
You must find a way

311
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,480
to seek justice for them,

312
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,560
instead of deceiving yourself,

313
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,200
and severing ties with them.

314
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,360
Fated yet ill-fated love!

315
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,880
It's all fate.

316
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,120
Mr. Han,

317
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,840
[regarding your marriage with my daughter,]

318
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,320
please allow me to think it over.

319
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,920
I humbly seek your understanding.

320
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,640
[A small place like our place]

321
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,800
is too frail to face the gales.

322
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,320
Today, I share these thoughts,

323
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
fully aware of the consequences.

324
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,320
I haven't slept all night,

325
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,600
[and I finally realized]

326
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,240
[I can't continue deceiving Caiwei]

327
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,840
[while marrying her.]

328
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,120
Apologies for the disturbance

329
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,920
I have caused during my stay.

330
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,160
I respectfully

331
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,320
take my leave.

332
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,440
My love!

333
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,160
Caiwei!

334
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,360
[Caiwei...]

335
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,000
Mr. Han is indeed

336
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
blood of

337
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,400
Lord Zhang.

338
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,680
The Jinxiu Workshop case

339
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,640
involves royal affairs

340
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
and is closely related to

341
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,520
Her Royal Highness' inner circle.

342
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,160
We must act with caution.

343
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,880
Right.

344
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,400
I will be careful.

345
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,680
Actually,

346
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,160
there's one more thing.

347
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,080
Back in the prison,

348
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
there was a little girl

349
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,200
who often came to see me at midnight,

350
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
bringing me food

351
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,000
and news from outside.

352
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,760
But starting one day,

353
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,200
I never saw her again.

354
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,600
I thought I would never see

355
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
her again in this life.

356
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,480
But yesterday,

357
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,720
I seemed to have found her.

358
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,480
Or perhaps

359
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,560
someone deeply resembles her.

360
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Many years ago,

361
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,160
you asked me to check

362
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,960
the entry and exit records of the prison.

363
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,520
It was to find her,

364
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,560
right?

365
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,520
But the records showed

366
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
no young girl entering or leaving.

367
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,920
So I couldn't help but doubt

368
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,440
whether this girl truly exists or if

369
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,720
it was just a figment of my imagination.

370
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,320
If she entered at night,

371
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,560
then most likely she

372
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,280
wouldn't have been recorded in the log.

373
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,840
That place of criminal confinement,

374
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,640
was also where I was confined.

375
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,200
Looking back now,

376
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,000
I still have nightmares about it.

377
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,960
If she dared to

378
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,680
enter the prison at night to care for you,

379
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,160
she must be a truly kind maiden.

380
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,680
If you truly share the fate,

381
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,960
and cross paths again,

382
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,520
you must treat her with all your heart.

383
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,120
If we destine to cross paths again,

384
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,160
there's no need for formal recognition.

385
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,080
Now I have become the most notorious

386
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,840
cruel official in the empire,

387
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,160
spoken of by all,

388
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
brutal and unjust,

389
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,320
releasing dogs to harm others.

390
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
I am ashamed to see

391
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,560
my childhood friends again.

392
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
"Releasing dogs to harm others?"

393
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,880
Are you referring to the time at Ming Hall?

394
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,640
If it weren't for you unleashing the dogs

395
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,680
to weed out the criminals,

396
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,560
everyone on site would

397
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,440
likely have perished under the arrows.

398
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,920
Chief Xu, though deep within the palace,

399
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,160
sees far and is fully aware

400
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,080
of the outside world.

401
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,480
Don't flatter me.

402
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,160
This incident is

403
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,280
well-known in Xiang'an.

404
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,760
It has become

405
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,400
another mark of shame

406
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,520
against your name, White Death.

407
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,200
Shen Du,

408
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,240
bearing such a notorious reputation,

409
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,520
do you think it's worth it?

410
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,600
Yan Xing!

411
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,640
You're overstepping your bounds again.

412
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,280
You still insist you haven't overstepped?

413
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,440
This is a classified document

414
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
sent by the Imperial Guard.

415
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,520
It's for your eyes only.

416
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,960
Originally,

417
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,560
the cases from the Imperial Guard

418
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,840
are intended for you.

419
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,040
But it must first be archived

420
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,360
and then distributed from the top down.

421
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,080
How could it go directly to you

422
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
without passing through me?

423
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,080
This matter,

424
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,720
you must

425
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,200
seriously remind the Imperial Guard about.

426
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,960
Alright, Lord Wu,

427
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,120
I will make sure to inform them.

428
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,400
All documents and

429
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,640
evidence sent over

430
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,440
must be reviewed and approved by you

431
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,880
before they can be distributed.

432
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,160
That sounds more like it.

433
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,840
What on earth is this?

434
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,920
A landmark code?

435
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,480
Grand Victory Stars?

436
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,520
Flower Cake Stars?

437
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,480
Cherry...

438
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,400
This must be my husband's

439
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,320
recent fascination

440
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,480
with astronomy.

441
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,960
While observing,

442
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,680
he sketched the constellations

443
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,280
and gifts them to the Ministry of Justice

444
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,800
for reference in investigations.

445
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,640
How peculiar.

446
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,080
Are these things even useful to us?

447
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,920
Are they?

448
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,720
This is the Ministry of Justice,

449
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,280
not the Imperial Astrology Bureau.

450
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,400
How absurd.

451
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,480
He believes we have much free time, huh?

452
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,360
[Without consuming pastries,]

453
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,680
[the stars remain shining high up.]

454
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,680
[It's impressive that he remembered all the]

455
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,600
[positions and names I rambled about.]

456
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,160
[Shen Du,]

457
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,120
[I will find a way]

458
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,840
[to cure your moonless sight.]

459
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,800
[People have clear vision during the day,]

460
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,200
[but at night, they cannot see.]

461
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,760
[This condition is called moonless sight.]

462
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,360
[To treat moonless sight, nourish the liver.]

463
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,760
These are the offal my lady requested.

464
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,600
They will be served to my lord as meals.

465
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,640
Are you cooking?

466
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
It looks more like you're casting spells.

467
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,080
Why is everyone gathered around?

468
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,160
There's nothing to see.

469
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,960
Back to your works.

470
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,560
Gujing herb.

471
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,800
You too, out.

472
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,360
Alright!

473
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,440
Now.

474
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,320
Let's get out.

475
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
Night vision grain.

476
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,560
My Lord.

477
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,960
This is the lamb's liver jelly

478
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,120
made by my lady for you.

479
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,480
Sir,

480
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,760
my lady has specifically instructed

481
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,480
that you must have a bowl of

482
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,120
herbal steamed chicken liver for lunch.

483
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,640
Lunch too?

484
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,840
There's no end of these, huh?

485
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,480
I'm not eating!

486
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,720
[I know why you're lighting]

487
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,920
[that many lamps at night.]

488
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,080
[If you wish to gaze the starry sky,]

489
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,000
[have these along with meals.]

490
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,560
[Otherwise,]

491
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,760
[read the second note.]

492
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,200
[If you don't want everyone in Xiang'an]

493
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,480
[to know White Death's secret,]

494
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,440
[then properly nourish yourself.]

495
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,840
What did you just call this

496
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,600
vile crap?

497
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,400
Sir,

498
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,040
listen

499
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,880
carefully,

500
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,720
it's steamed

501
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,480
chicken liver

502
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,240
with Gujing herb,

503
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,160
and you know,

504
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,960
night vision

505
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,360
together.

506
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,400
I know what Gujing herb is,

507
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,040
but what is this

508
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,560
night vision grain?

509
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,840
Sir,

510
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,120
are you sure

511
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,640
you want to know?

512
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,440
Bat droppings.

513
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Yan...

514
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,000
Yan...

515
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,680
Yan Xing!

516
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,120
Sir,

517
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,880
why don't you just skip it?

518
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,920
Go to the Ministry of Justice

519
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,920
and bring her here for me!

520
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,880
My Lady, please stay alert.

521
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,760
After Mr Shen finished the chicken liver,

522
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
his mood hasn't been normal.

523
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,240
I shall oversee guardsmen's training.

524
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,600
Stop watching!

525
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,160
You too!

526
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,680
[Yan Xing,]

527
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,640
if you desire to murder your husband,

528
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,080
just stab me clean through.

529
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,400
Why go through all this trouble,

530
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,480
making these nauseating soups?

531
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,800
Shen Du!

532
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,360
You're repaying kindness with ingratitude.

533
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,040
I've searched through

534
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,920
all the medical texts

535
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,320
to come up with this recipe.

536
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,760
Ancient medical records state

537
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,080
that moonless sight should be treated with

538
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,760
[liver-nourishing and vision-enhancing foods,]

539
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,440
like animal offal, and...

540
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,760
Not just animal organs,

541
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,160
but also animal feces.

542
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,640
What are you talking about?

543
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,120
Are you referring to

544
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,680
night vision grain?

545
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,560
The herbal

546
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,720
steamed chicken liver is

547
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
mentioned

548
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,800
in the "Theory of Various

549
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,640
Disease Sources".

550
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,080
Night vision grain

551
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,080
is the most crucial medicinal ingredient.

552
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,200
Chamberlain Shen

553
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,640
ran all over the city's pharmacies

554
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,720
to procure it for you.

555
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,320
[I steamed it all night to prepare it.]

556
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,800
Don't mistake my good intentions

557
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,240
for foolishness (it mentions liver).

558
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,400
Don't mention the word "liver" again!

559
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,200
Good medicine is bitter to the taste.

560
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,840
[Expressing your desperation]

561
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,440
like this is pointless.

562
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,080
I...

563
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
If you have

564
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,360
nothing important,

565
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,320
I'll head back to the office.

566
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,120
Chen Shoujie has been

567
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
recuperating at the healing house lately,

568
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,080
clear-headed now, and dazed then.

569
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,080
I've already brought him here.

570
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,640
If you want to question him,

571
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,120
just follow me.

572
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,200
Mr Chen,

573
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,880
could you tell me

574
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,280
what exactly happened?

575
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,240
Why do you have

576
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,040
the embroideries from Jinxiu Shop?

577
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,120
She is my concubine.

578
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,560
She used to work at the Shop

579
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,760
as an embroiderer.

580
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,400
She even took on apprentices.

581
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,920
Her skills are truly remarkable.

582
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,520
During the Shop incident,

583
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,400
she happened to be away.

584
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,120
Afterward, the authorities searched for

585
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,320
the accomplices, and she hid everywhere.

586
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,440
Then she ran into me.

587
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,560
[Impressed by her diligence and resilience,]

588
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,800
I chose her to be my concubine.

589
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,920
These embroideries

590
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,280
are just her way

591
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
of passing the time,

592
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,120
Fire!

593
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
Fire!

594
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,800
You may retrieve

595
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,480
nothing more from him.

596
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,040
So, Mrs Chen

597
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,920
was an embroiderer at the Shop.

598
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,960
[The murderer chose to silence her,]

599
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,920
trying to eliminate

600
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,800
everyone related to the Shop.

601
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,920
They wanted to wipe them all out.

602
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
If so,

603
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,120
does this mean

604
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,320
there is a big secret

605
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,080
behind this case?

606
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,240
A secret so crucial that the murderer

607
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,000
would go to the lengths of silencing others.

608
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,840
But right now, it's all just speculation.

609
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
There's no evidence.

610
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,280
Indeed,

611
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,160
further investigation is needed,

612
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,040
and it must be

613
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,360
targeted.

614
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,520
I'm gonna

615
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,440
write and submit a request

616
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,920
to the Ministry of Justice tomorrow

617
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,920
to merge the case of Chen Huo'e

618
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,960
with that of Jinxiu Shop

619
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,600
for joint investigation.

620
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,000
That might be challenging.

621
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,160
[These two cases involve]

622
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,560
[too many people.]

623
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,200
I don't think they would want a resurface.

624
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
They'll do everything in their power

625
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,520
to obstruct the investigation.

626
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,840
Without trying,

627
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,320
how could you know the outcome?

628
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,040
What's going on?

629
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,240
Princess Ying's men are giving

630
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,160
Han Shiyuan a hard time,

631
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,120
blocking the way.

632
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,600
Mr. Han,

633
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,840
Her Highness requests your presence.

634
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,920
Wait!

635
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,280
Don't be restless.

636
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,520
Jing Lin!

637
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,480
Go find Zhang Baohuan!

638
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,160
[Yes, sir!]
