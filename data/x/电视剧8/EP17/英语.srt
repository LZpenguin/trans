1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,160
Shooting Stars EP17

3
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Please come in.

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,960
Because Mr. Zhang hasn't come,

5
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,040
I didn't clean up.

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,680
It's quite dusty.

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,640
I hope you don't mind.

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
Honestly,

9
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
good living conditions.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,280
You bet.

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,400
Since

12
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,560
he has paid the rent,

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,880
I don't need to care

14
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
about anything else.

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
But something

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,680
happened to me.

17
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,320
My son is getting married.

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,760
I wanna give him this house

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,560
for his wedding.

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,400
What a joyful event!

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
Congratulations!

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,800
Thank you.

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,240
Mr. Zhang

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
has put everything in that room.

25
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,680
You can have a look.

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,040
OK.

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,440
This way, please.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,040
Then

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,400
I wrote him

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,440
saying that I planned

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,200
to repay him the money.

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,800
Anyway no one lives here.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
He agreed.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,760
Really?

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,240
Good!

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Here's the rent.

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,440
Here you are.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,840
Please hand it over to him.

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,720
OK.

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,280
Well,

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,920
his baggage's all here.

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,480
you can check it out.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,280
Then we'll leave as soon as

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
we pack them up.

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,000
OK, I'm leaving now.

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Accountant?

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,800
Headmaster of a primary school?

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
The house turns out

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,720
to be rented for the Mengs.

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,080
No wonder no one lives here.

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,280
Deng Mingyuan and Zhang Runjin...

52
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,880
The Communist Party has paid

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,000
such a great price

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
for the Mengs.

55
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,440
Renting a house, finding jobs...

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Even the work permits

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
have been ready.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,720
Xiang Yuansheng?

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
Xiang Yuansheng.

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Now.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,840
Give me all the documents

62
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
of the murder case.

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,040
All of them!

64
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,360
What is

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,960
the exact plan?

67
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Did Deng Mingyuan

68
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
send someone to save the girl?

69
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,760
Have you ever met?

70
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
What is the name?

71
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,320
Is still in Shanghai?

72
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,880
Deng

73
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
did arrange a person

74
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,760
to protect them.

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,440
But I don't know the details.

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Meng Duoci.

77
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,000
Deng Mingyuan

78
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
asked He Youqing

79
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,560
to protect the Mengs.

80
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,440
If

81
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,440
He had gone to Guangzhou,

82
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,840
he'd have taken the name

83
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,400
of Xiang Yuansheng.

84
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,960
But failed.

85
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,680
Because he died

86
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,080
at Van Hwa Hotel.

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
Then who is the policeman

88
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,400
named Xiang Yuansheng

89
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
at the Fourth Station House?

90
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
Whatever.

91
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,800
As long as

92
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
he uses this name,

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,880
he

94
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
is Xiang Yuansheng.

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,560
Here's the ticket

96
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
back to Nanjing.

97
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,960
I learned

98
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
from your brother

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
that you promised

100
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,000
to get on the train on time.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,960
I'm required

102
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,440
to send you the ticket in person.

103
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
Young Master.

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
Thanks.

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
By the way,

106
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,760
I'll take the train with you

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,680
to Nanjing.

108
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,640
I'm gonna work for

109
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,320
the Staff Section

110
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,440
of the Central Military

111
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Academy Camping Office in Suzhou.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
Before that, I'll rest in Nanjing for days.

113
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,560
My brother said

114
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,480
you'll be

115
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
the Colonel Director there.

116
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,960
Congrats.

117
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,600
I know you fellow

118
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
don't care about this at all.

119
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,720
No need

120
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,960
to show off to you.

121
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,880
But as your friend,

122
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,640
I have to say something.

123
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
We both

124
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,000
have a bright future.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,080
Everyone is stepping up,

126
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,520
so don't waste your time.

127
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,880
You should be

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,760
back to the right path.

129
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,160
I know.

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,080
You always

131
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,400
say that.

132
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,520
What happened the last time

133
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,080
I took you to the train station

134
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
back to Nanjing?

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Listen.

136
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,280
I'll pick you up the day after tomorrow.

137
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,720
You must keep your promise.

138
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
Thanks for the ticket.

139
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Enough.

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Get away.

141
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,400
I've packed your luggage.

142
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
The house in Hong Kong is similar

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
to the one in Shanghai,

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
with a good and safe

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
living environment.

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,640
Why don't you eat?

147
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,640
That friend of your parents

148
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,280
is an amiable lady.

149
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,840
She and her husband will take care of you.

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,160
And I'll send you

151
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,720
living expenses

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
every three months.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
Anyhow you don't need to be worried.

154
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,320
What's wrong?

155
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,760
Ms. Shi,

156
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,200
do you know ISKRA?

157
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,840
Yuansheng and I

158
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,880
went to a small courtyard in the suburb.

159
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
There're many children

160
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,800
and a big tree

161
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,560
hanging full of stars.

162
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
This one is the gift

163
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,560
those children gave me.

164
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,160
I also heard that ISKRA

165
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,800
is a project

166
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,480
to protect them.

167
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
My dad and mum

168
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,520
are members of it.

169
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,320
You've been

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,200
to the orphanage on Xinping Road.

171
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,400
Do you know that?

172
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,720
Actually,

173
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm also a member

174
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,680
of ISKRA.

175
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
Your parents are super heroes

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,400
and they've worked so hard

177
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,680
to protect those children.

178
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
The money in the safe in HSBC

179
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
are prepared for this project

180
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,800
by your parents.

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,800
Now the money

182
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
has been sent to the North safely

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,520
through multiple efforts.

184
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
Only resisting Japanese invaders

185
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,800
and defending our country,

186
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,400
can we help the children

187
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
lead a good life.

188
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Do you understand?

189
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,520
Ms. Shi,

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,160
can I join you?

191
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,280
Not now.

192
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,160
You're still a little girl.

193
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
What about when I grow up?

194
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,280
Ms. Shi,

195
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,200
when did you join

196
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,400
ISKRA?

197
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,640
Let me tell a story.

198
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,880
When I was 17,

199
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,640
I took a boat from Nanjing

200
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,000
to Dalian on my own,

201
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,880
then took a train

202
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,000
to Harbin,

203
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,000
then to Manzhouli.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Finally I took a train

205
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
from Manzhouli to Moscow.

206
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,760
I still remember

207
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
it's freezing cold

208
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,880
in Moscow then.

209
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,680
But I felt

210
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
that my heart was burning.

211
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,640
Qiushi,

212
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,400
you may have to make a choice

213
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,280
when you reach the age of 17.

214
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,760
At that time,

215
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
you will

216
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,560
know what to do.

217
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,240
Good.

218
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,360
Great.

219
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Yuansheng.

220
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm setting out

221
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
for Hong Kong today.

222
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,960
Will you remember me?

223
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,880
Of course.

224
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,360
How can I forget you?

225
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,600
Duoci,

226
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
everything in Shanghai is about to pass.

227
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,720
Start your new life

228
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,360
in Hong Kong.

229
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,720
I will.

230
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,120
And I will miss you

231
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
and Minmin as well.

232
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,680
Here's the medicine I bought

233
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,760
for Minmin,

234
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,720
but I didn't have a chance

235
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,840
to meet her.

236
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,760
Could you bring it to her?

237
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,560
Yes.

238
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,200
Yuansheng,

239
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,560
do you believe

240
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,640
we'll meet in the future?

241
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,720
Absolutely.

242
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,760
But when?

243
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,600
When you grow up.

244
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,360
I'd grow up quickly.

245
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,960
OK.

246
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,320
What

247
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,720
kind of person

248
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,360
will I become then?

249
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,240
You are just 8.

250
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,560
Your future

251
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,360
is your own the final say.

252
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,600
You

253
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,840
and those 400 children

254
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,560
are all

255
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,840
little stars,

256
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,120
and you'll

257
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
definitely shine brightly.

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,720
Thank you so much.

259
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,840
I wanna thank you as well.

260
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,360
Please.

261
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,240
Don't leave me alone.

262
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
Mister,

263
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,320
did you come to Shanghai

264
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,160
from another place?

265
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,280
I've booked a train ticket

266
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,000
to Nanjing 3 days later.

267
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,040
And I'll pay the bill

268
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,280
for your daily meals.

269
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,600
Besides,

270
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,480
I'm not in charge of you.

271
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,440
Do you agree?

272
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,440
Yes.

273
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Meng Duoci,

274
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,560
I've decided to stay here.

275
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,640
Remember the following two points.

276
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,920
First,

277
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,640
I can't take you to Nanjing

278
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,000
for some reasons.

279
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,000
Second,

280
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,160
we'll refer to

281
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,200
each other as cousins.

282
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,200
OK.

283
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
Is your name Li Qiushi?

284
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,480
No, I'm Meng Duoci.

285
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,760
What's your name?

286
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,360
Hua Zhen.

287
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,600
Qiushi,

288
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,160
your parents,

289
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,920
my teacher,

290
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,920
and their comrades

291
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,280
are all true heroes.

292
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,480
Yuansheng,

293
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
I miss

294
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,680
my parents so much.

295
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,760
Qiushi!

296
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,000
Are you all right?

297
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,280
Did you get hurt?

298
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,240
Yuansheng saved me.

299
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,680
But can he take good

300
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,200
care of you for this month?

301
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,560
He has

302
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,000
always been doing well.

303
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,000
Qiushi,

304
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,240
if there's any problem

305
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,360
you don't understand,

306
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,120
come to find me at the photo studio,

307
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,040
OK?

308
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,360
Sure.

309
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,760
Thanks, Minmin.

310
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,080
Yuansheng!

311
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,680
I like Minmin

312
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,160
and her family so much.

313
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,040
Do you like Minmin?

314
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,560
Just go to bed.

315
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,080
No...

316
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,920
I don't wanna sleep.

317
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,000
Qiushi, run!

318
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,160
What's Xiang Yuansheng's

319
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,800
sister's name?

320
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,360
Li Qiushi.

321
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,880
Qiushi!

322
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,000
Qiushi!

323
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,480
Yuansheng,

324
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,840
what kind of person

325
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,720
will I become when I grow up?

326
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
You are just 8.

327
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,920
You can be any people

328
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,720
you want to be.

329
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,440
Qiushi,

330
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,560
when you reach the age of 17,

331
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,040
whether you want to choose the path or not,

332
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
you will

333
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,800
have an answer by the time.

334
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,560
Come here.

335
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,320
Don't steal a glance.

336
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,520
Don't cheat.

337
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,560
Are we there yet?

338
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,480
Ready.

339
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,960
Three, two, one.

340
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,600
You asked me

341
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,920
if there's a lounge for policewomen

342
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,320
at the Fourth Station.

343
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,720
There wasn't before,

344
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
but there is now.

345
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,280
And fresh flowers.

346
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,040
Are you content now?

347
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,840
Yes.

348
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,920
I'm satisfied.

349
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,560
We've made a deal

350
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,680
that the room is only for you.

351
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,040
Even the director can't get in there.

352
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,280
What are you talking about?

353
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,400
Director.

354
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,520
What do you mean

355
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,560
even I can't get in there?

356
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,120
No way.

357
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,320
What's wrong?

358
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,480
Not accessible for you.

359
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,160
See, rest room for ladies.

360
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
If you are a policewoman,

361
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,720
we will let you in.

362
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,040
Your preparation is quite complete.

363
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,480
I just take a look

364
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
at the decoration outside.

365
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,680
Nice.

366
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,560
Romantic.

367
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,720
These brats are often

368
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,160
generous at my expense.

369
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,520
This room was my little warehouse

370
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,960
for tobacco, alcohol, sugar and tea.

371
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,480
You can have it now.

372
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,960
Thanks, director!

373
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,240
It seems like you are

374
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,960
having a problem with this.

375
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,480
Who?

376
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,480
Do you?

377
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,720
Or you?

378
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,400
No I don't.

379
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,640
Let me see who dare

380
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,920
disagree with Minmin's room.

381
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,480
OK stop giggling

382
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,880
and don't crowd around

383
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,560
the girl's room.

384
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Get away.

385
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,200
Thanks director.

386
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,680
Thank all of you!

387
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,320
Captain Chen.

388
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,880
Here's the uniform I return to the Fourth Station.

389
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,720
Additionally,

390
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,880
the medicine Qiushi bought for Minmin.

391
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,960
Why don't you go in there

392
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,480
and bid farewell to our comrades.

393
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,080
Here you sing again.

394
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,960
Hello.

395
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,760
Hi, Captain.

396
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,920
All passed the evaluation.

397
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,760
Spread the good news.

398
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Has your suspension been revoked?

399
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,240
Yes.

400
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,200
I'll do this.

401
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,920
Everyone out!

402
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,800
We're coming.

403
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,520
Erbai.

404
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,880
Captain.

405
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,040
I'll announce an important thing.

406
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,680
You've passed

407
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,680
the evaluation.

408
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,160
We've been

409
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,400
officially certified, right?

410
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,160
Of course!

411
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,720
Tian Dongbao!

412
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
Sun Hongfa!

413
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,200
Luo Minmin!

414
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,280
Cool.

415
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,720
Come on, Yuansheng.

416
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,680
Good news.

417
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,480
Yuansheng.

418
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,920
You've passed the evaluation.

419
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm here today

420
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,680
to say goodbye to you.

421
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,120
Before here,

422
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I majored in

423
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,720
navigation science of the S.M.C.

424
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,040
The holiday is over.

425
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,080
I should go back

426
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,880
for fighting trainings.

427
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,040
It's time

428
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,280
for me to leave Shanghai.

429
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,720
Aren't you a fisherman?

430
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,720
Well,

431
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,000
we've seen your personal file

432
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,680
which wrote fisherman.

433
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,400
Sorry.

434
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,560
But I am not.

435
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,720
And my name isn't Xiang Yuansheng.

436
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,960
but Hua Zhen.

437
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,400
I borrowed this name

438
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,280
out of special reasons.

439
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,720
These are from Qiushi

440
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,560
who knew that you got injured.

441
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,920
She bought the medicine for you.

442
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
But she can't

443
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,880
hand it to you on her own.

444
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,480
Thank you.

445
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,720
She asked me to express her thanks

446
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,760
to all of you

447
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,560
for helping her

448
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,200
these days.

449
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,680
Has she left Shanghai safely?

450
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,720
Yes, she has.

451
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,040
Will you...

452
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,680
be back to Shanghai in the future?

453
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Maybe not.

454
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,120
Since you're leaving soon,

455
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,040
let's take a picture together

456
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,960
as a souvenir.

457
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,320
Great.

458
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,040
Good idea.

459
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,720
Let's take a photo.

460
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,480
Right.

461
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,280
A group photo.

462
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,520
We can go to Minmin's shop.

463
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,120
Exactly.

464
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,240
Let's take a photo.

465
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,920
We must do it.

466
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,200
We are all here,

467
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,920
aren't we?

468
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,800
Yes.

469
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,120
It's dark inside.

470
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,400
I can't see anything.

471
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,680
Let me try it.

472
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Let me.

473
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,960
That's amazing.

474
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,040
Is there anything in it?

475
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,120
I don't know.

476
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,320
Look at it.

477
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,040
Don't touch.

478
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,720
Ready?

479
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,040
Leave here.

480
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,480
Yuansheng,

481
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,680
when back to Nanjing,

482
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,480
would you take a boat every day?

483
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,240
That's called warship.

484
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
My bad.

485
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,920
If we'll go find you there,

486
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,360
can we have a chance

487
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,480
to take a warship?

488
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,480
We can go to visit Yuansheng

489
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,960
in our spare time then.

490
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,880
No problem.

491
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,960
But I wonder

492
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,320
if we can take the warship

493
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,240
at any time?

494
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,880
Well.

495
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,440
Everyone here.

496
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,520
Let's take a photo.

497
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,160
Let me first, sir.

498
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,920
Hey, mate.

499
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,720
Step aside.

500
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,520
What do you mean?

501
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,920
You want a personal photo?

502
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,160
Dad.

503
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,720
Is it OK?

504
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,120
C'mon,

505
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,240
group photo!

506
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,480
It costs much for a photo.

507
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,720
Come here.

508
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,520
A group photo.

509
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Together.

510
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,720
Where should I?

511
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,800
Well,

512
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,000
you are in the center.

513
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,880
Don't move.

514
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,000
Just in the middle.

515
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,680
Yuansheng,

516
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
you are leaving soon.

517
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,040
Stand in the front.

518
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,320
I...

519
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,560
You're the most important today.

520
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,640
Stand beside me.

521
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,480
Captain, over here.

522
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,120
One missing.

523
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,560
Captain.

524
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,400
Hurry up.

525
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,400
Be positive.

526
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,200
Check your hook and eye

527
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,960
and the hat.

528
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,320
Don't be so strict.

529
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,560
Let me check.

530
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,160
You are cool.

531
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Ready?

532
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Yes.

533
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Sure?

534
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,760
OK.

535
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,320
OK.

536
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,120
Wait a minute.

537
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,680
Give us a signal.

538
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,040
We have a slogan.

539
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,400
You only have one chance.

540
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,200
Only one.

541
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,920
OK.

542
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,520
Alright,

543
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,680
look at me.

544
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,920
OK.

545
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,560
How about

546
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,680
smiling?

547
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Smile.

548
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Smiling is good for a photo.

549
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,440
OK, smile.

550
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,840
Smile.

551
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:15,840
That's right.

552
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,040
OK.

553
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,960
Keep it.

554
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,480
Look at me.

555
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
Ready?

556
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,480
Speak up the slogan!

557
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
Upholding justice

558
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,320
and protecting people.

559
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,720
Would you like

560
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,760
to have a walk?

561
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,760
With me?

562
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,240
Please transfer to the Fourth Station

563
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
of Shiliupu.

564
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,600
Sorry.

565
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,360
It failed because of the bad weather.

566
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
You can try it again later.

567
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,760
Luo Minmin!

568
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,960
Luo Minmin!

569
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,720
Tianxiang,

570
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,440
Luo Qinqin.

571
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,280
Why are you here?

572
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,440
It's raining.

573
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,040
Dad asked us to bring you an umbrella.

574
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,480
We also brought some food for you.

575
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,920
We'll stay with you for a while.

576
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,040
I can show you

577
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,760
the restroom

578
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,720
that the Fourth Station

579
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,400
prepared for me only.

580
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,920
Come on in.

581
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,560
You see,

582
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,200
I'm welcomed here.

583
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,640
Tianxiang, it's better than your room.

584
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,040
Indeed.

585
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,960
Good.

586
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,040
They are nice to you.

587
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,600
This comb

588
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
is also sent by them.

589
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,520
Luo Minmin,

590
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,920
Yuansheng will leave tomorrow.

591
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
Don't you know that?

592
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Don't you wanna say something

593
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,680
and bid farewell to him?

594
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,280
No.

595
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,400
You definitely like him.

596
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,760
He brought medicine to you.

597
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,440
You've recovered.

598
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,480
No need for medicine at all.

599
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,120
What are you talking about?

600
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,120
How could you understand

601
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,200
what is it as a child?

602
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,920
Adults don't understand.

603
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,680
It must be that

604
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,320
you've read too many love stories.

605
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,280
I'll be 18 years old

606
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,760
a few months later.

607
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,720
So what?

608
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,440
I'm still

609
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
your elder sister then.

610
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,480
If I were you,

611
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,320
I'd concentrate on

612
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,400
college entrance exam.

613
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,720
Focus on yourself.

614
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,800
Gosh.

615
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,960
You know nothing.

616
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,400
When Yuansheng back to the navy,

617
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,960
he'll fight in the battlefield.

618
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,480
I mean battlefield!

619
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
It means

620
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,160
you may never see him anymore.

621
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Luo Qinqin,

622
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,680
don't say bad words.

623
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,120
What?

624
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,920
How dare you say

625
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,680
we'll never see each other.

626
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,120
No.

627
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,720
I won't say it.

628
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,480
I'm teaching you about love.

629
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,640
Stop.

630
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Luo Qinqin,

631
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,040
how could you teach me?

632
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
I don't need you.

633
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,080
Fine.

634
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,840
I can do nothing.

635
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,960
How could you two

636
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
argue with each other

637
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,880
wherever you go?

638
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,880
I'm your sister.

639
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Yuansheng.

640
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,560
Yuansheng is coming.

641
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,800
I...

642
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,240
I'm here for something.

643
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,320
What are you searching for?

644
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,000
The Brochure of Police.

645
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,600
You are here

646
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,960
for the book

647
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,600
no matter of the heavy rain?

648
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
I won't be a policeman any more.

649
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
I want it as a souvenir.

650
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,320
Are you on duty alone?

651
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,240
You should

652
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,040
have been here too.

653
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
No time for the change.

654
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,400
It doesn't matter.

655
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,240
My brother and sister

656
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,560
came for me.

657
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,880
It's here.

658
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,840
I came by car

659
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,320
without an umbrella.

660
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Do you have one?

661
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,800
No.

662
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,080
I don't.

663
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,520
Well...

664
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,120
Then I have to leave

665
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,920
after the rain stops.

666
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,360
Alright.

667
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,360
Chop some sweet potatoes.

668
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,160
OK.

669
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,800
Is the restroom

670
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,960
prepared for you

671
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,840
by Erbai?

672
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,080
Yes,

673
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,320
it is.

674
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,840
It's

675
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,920
only for me.

676
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,000
I know why you

677
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,320
like here

678
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,360
so much.

679
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,360
Congrats!

680
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,640
You're certified as a police officer.

681
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,600
You must admire me.

682
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,320
You've passed the evaluation.

683
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840
If you want to stay here,

684
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,160
it still has time left.

685
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,080
Are you really in the navy?

686
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
I've seen the ship

687
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,920
which is vast.

688
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,480
Can you sail ships

689
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,360
like that?

690
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,400
The reason you became a marine

691
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
is due to the conscription

692
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,640
like my brother?

693
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,760
You always talk about a topic

694
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,920
I don't like.

695
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
No.

696
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,080
I also have a brother.

697
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,080
My father hopes that one of us becomes an officer

698
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,920
while the other becomes a soldier.

699
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,880
It happens that being in the navy

700
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,800
is my dream.

701
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,920
So, I went to the military school.

702
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,160
How about your brother?

703
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,360
He is a secretary

704
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,600
Office of Aides in Office of Aides.

705
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,520
Similar to

706
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,200
the Grand Council before.

707
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,160
The Grand Council?

708
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,680
The Grand Council.

709
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,080
The Grand Council...

710
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,720
A department for the Chairman

711
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,800
for handling issues.

712
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,280
What about your father?

713
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,520
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Military Affairs.

714
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,800
However,

715
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,080
being in navy is my dream,

716
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,840
no matter whether my family

717
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,320
supports me or not.

718
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,760
If I were you,

719
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,240
I would stay at home

720
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,000
without doing nothing.

721
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,680
If so,

722
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
you wouldn't

723
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,360
come back here

724
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,960
after

725
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,520
your dad asked you

726
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,640
to run the photo studio.

727
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,800
But you're back finally.

728
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,240
Because I know that I'm a ball,

729
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,760
which may deflate easily

730
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,480
but

731
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,920
never be broken.

732
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,920
A man with a strong heart

733
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,480
must has

734
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,400
a warm family.

735
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,960
I admire you.

736
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,680
You are strong.

737
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,360
You are a person

738
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
supported by the God.

739
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,080
I have a good relationship with my brother.

740
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,160
But I...

741
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,360
rarely see my parents.

742
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,080
My father has always been busy

743
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,360
with his business.

744
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,520
I hardly met him when I was a kid.

745
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,800
After I moved to school,

746
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,520
the situation worsened.

747
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,640
Most peers around me

748
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,920
have similar experiences.

749
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,200
So, after meeting you,

750
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,320
I realized that

751
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,600
there is a completely different

752
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,160
family relationship from mine.

753
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,760
Embrace for joy,

754
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,280
and argue for anger.

755
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,920
You can

756
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,240
show care and love directly.

757
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,360
It seems that I can't do this.

758
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,160
It's so easy.

759
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,440
Just need to talk...

760
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,120
In fact,

761
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,960
it's you

762
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,520
who made me know

763
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,880
what kind of person

764
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,120
I wanna be.

765
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,280
My dad asked me

766
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,800
why I must be a police officer.

767
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,480
Actually,

768
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,760
I'm not being

769
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
police officer forever.

770
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,200
I believe that people

771
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,800
must be able

772
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,080
to do something well,

773
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,680
not be

774
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,080
unaware of what they want,

775
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,840
and not be

776
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,280
worthless.

777
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,520
What about you?

778
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,640
Why do you want to be in navy?

779
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,240
Many said

780
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,640
it's a shortcut for promotion

781
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,360
to go to the S.M.C.

782
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,920
from the Army University.

783
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,520
But it wasn't.

784
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,160
