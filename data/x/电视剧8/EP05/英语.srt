3
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
You can leave me alone just now.

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,920
As the captain,

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
it's my duty to protect my members,

6
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
especially on this matter.

7
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,280
Well, can you open the window?

8
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,680
What's up?

9
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,480
You smell like

10
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,720
smelly salted fish.

11
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,920
If I'm not mistaken,

12
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,720
your registration card

13
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
says you're fisherman.

14
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,760
Why aren't you used to it?

15
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,480
I do go to sea for fish,

16
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
but not for salted fish.

17
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,160
Move!

18
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,880
Hurry.

19
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,440
Hurry up.

20
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Don't dawdle.

21
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,920
You return the car back.

22
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
This is your police ID card.

23
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,120
Take it.

24
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,120
Captain,

25
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,400
may I ask you a question?

26
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,360
Say it.

27
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,880
Have you considered the consequence

28
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
of being thrown down from the van?

29
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm always lucky,

30
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,480
or I can't be a policeman.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,920
Miss Luo,

32
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
what's wrong with your arm?

33
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,880
Is it injured?

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
Nothing. No worries.

35
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
As a cop,

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,920
it's normal to get minor injuries.

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,200
You will get used to it.

38
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,960
Erbai, have a pancake here.

39
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,560
Cool.

40
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,040
Miss Luo,

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,560
did you learn how to arrest people

42
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,640
at the training class?

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Of course.

44
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
I didn't learn other courses very well,

45
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,560
but got full marks in martial arts gymnastics.

46
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,160
Great.

47
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,760
Awesome.

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,920
Luo Minmin.

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,040
You caught a thief

50
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,760
in the first mission.

51
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Good job.

52
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,760
Really?

53
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,320
That's enough.

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,400
Stop applauding.

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
Listen up.

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,480
Have

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,040
a sit.

58
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,760
Can you not be startled so easily

59
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,320
in the following missions.

60
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,920
You've got a wrong guy.

61
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,840
We're too nervous.

62
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
So excited.

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,320
I tell you,

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
before the mission,

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,480
you must observe at first, then judge,

66
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,400
and finally take action.

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Understand?

68
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,680
Got it.

69
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,880
Yuansheng.

70
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,200
Hello.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
Join us.

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,040
C'mon.

73
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,120
No, thanks.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm gonna interrogate the prisoner.

75
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,960
Wait.

76
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,840
Prisoner?

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,200
How much do you know

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
about this case?

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,360
When we looked into it,

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,440
you were not here.

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,560
It's not your turn

82
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,160
to interrogate the prisoner.

83
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
I'm talking to you.

84
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,400
Do you understand?

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,400
Erbai.

86
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,080
Calm down.

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,560
Take it easy.

88
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,160
Enjoy the pancake.

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,000
It's getting cold.

90
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,200
Erbai...

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm going to the bathroom.

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,120
He's crazy at earning honor.

93
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,080
Captain,

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,280
I wanna participate in interrogation.

95
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
Why?

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Don't forget,

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,800
you're just intern.

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
I caught that guy in person.

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,840
Fine, help me do the record.

100
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
[4 girls in total,]

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,400
2 in Fenghuang Dance Hall,

102
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,120
and the other 2 in the Great World.

103
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
What are their names?

104
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,400
How can I remember that?

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,640
I just need to search for girls.

106
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,840
Good look is enough.

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,400
Name is not important.

108
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,560
Don't giggle with me.

109
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
I really don't know

110
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,520
their names.

111
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,840
But the places I mentioned

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,720
are absolutely right.

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,280
They

114
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
must be there.

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,840
Sir.

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,960
I...

117
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,680
If you bring

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
these girls back,

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
could you get me out of the jail earlier?

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,360
Wait.

121
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
there's another case.

122
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,600
What?

123
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,000
Another one?

124
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm only

125
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,520
involved in...

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,880
Last Wednesday,

127
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,120
have you been to Van Hwa Hotel?

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,880
Yes, I have.

129
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
And your staff

130
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,160
have followed to

131
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,520
the Hotel, haven't you?

132
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,560
I saw you that day.

133
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
At the gateway.

134
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,360
I also saw

135
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,960
you climbing from the exterior wall

136
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
to the window

137
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,680
of the Room 311,

138
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,560
pausing for seconds and back away.

139
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,560
I...

140
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,440
have been there that day.

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
But I didn't climb on the wall.

142
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,760
You must have made a mistake.

143
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,960
You may wanna flip over

144
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
from the wall to the fire exit

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,760
to escape from there.

146
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,120
But why did you pause

147
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,160
outside the window

148
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,760
of Room 311

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
for seconds and back away?

150
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,320
No, I didn't.

151
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,000
You're talking nonsense.

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,760
Family Meng

153
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,000
were murdered in Room 311.

154
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,200
Have you seen the scene

155
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,560
and the murderer

156
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,640
from the window?

157
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,680
I...

158
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,560
Sir.

159
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,880
I just cheated several girls,

160
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,440
and may be put into jail for months.

161
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,520
Don't drag me into something else

162
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,680
and put me in the wrong.

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,320
Do you think we may

164
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
do wrong to you?

165
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,960
I'll leave you with some time.

166
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Get out.

167
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,080
Why do you care

168
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
about the murder?

169
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,280
I've been to Van Hwa Hotel that day,

170
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,520
and you recorded my statement.

171
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,120
He is a witness,

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
and I'm a policeman now.

173
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,520
I may obtain

174
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,240
some clues from him.

175
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Why don't you tell me

176
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,040
such

177
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
important information

178
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,560
at the time you came here?

179
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,880
I don't trust you.

180
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm a policeman.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
Before the killer is caught,

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
anyone who went to the Hotel that day

183
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,840
is under suspicion.

184
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,760
You too.

185
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,200
Captain,

186
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
I just need an honour.

187
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
Xiang Yuansheng.

188
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
You'd better tell me

189
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,840
everything you know.

190
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,280
You ready?

191
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
I promise that I can

192
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:40,960
keep anything

193
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,200
from your mouth confidential.

194
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,120
Proactively providing

195
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,280
information to assist the police

196
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,440
can help alleviate punishment.

197
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,760
Will the punishment

198
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,320
be less if I...

199
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,880
Then you must

200
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
tell the truth.

201
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,400
Sure.

202
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,960
As you ran after me closely that day,

203
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,640
I had no choice

204
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,440
but climbed

205
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,200
onto the wall.

206
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
I wanna

207
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,960
look for an empty room

208
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,880
to hide in.

209
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,360
But as soon as I reached

210
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,840
the window of the Room 311,

211
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,320
I saw 3 people lying on the floor,

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,960
obviously dead.

213
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,520
They're throat killed.

214
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,200
The murderer

215
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,520
seems like a policeman.

216
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
A policeman?

217
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah,

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
just like you.

219
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,640
He's wearing the uniform

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,680
and a police cap.

221
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,960
He had a knife in his hand.

222
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,960
He's rummaging around in the room

223
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,000
for something.

224
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you remember

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,320
his looks?

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,680
Well...

227
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,760
Paint it down.

228
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I can try.

229
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,520
[All out!]

230
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
Captain!

231
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Mr. Feng is coming.

232
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,840
Captain!

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,640
Mr. Feng is here.

234
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,200
Hi, Mr. Feng.

235
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,920
Is this the man

236
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,280
you brought from the French Concession?

237
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,440
Yes, sir.

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,960
We'll take him away.

239
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Go get in.

240
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,320
Yes, sir.

241
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,640
Yes, sir.

242
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,320
Why?

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why?

244
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,600
You

245
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
don't know why?

246
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Because you offended foreigners,

247
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,880
then were reported to the head office.

248
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
You may lose your job.

249
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Is it that inspector

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,040
who complained to you?

251
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,800
Is that important?

252
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,320
Where the prisoner

253
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,280
will be taken?

254
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,000
Who is talking to me?

255
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,280
I am.

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,760
Who are you?

257
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
New policeman here.

258
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,760
Xiang Yuansheng

259
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Is he recruited by you?

260
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
By the back door.

261
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,520
I can't manage him.

262
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,240
Wanna know it?

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Listen,

264
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,280
because of you,

265
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,720
I now have to work overtime

266
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,120
to send him to the Municipal Council

267
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,760
and have to give an apology.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If the Council cancels the complaint,

269
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,200
will you bring him

270
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
back to us?

271
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,120
Wait.

272
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,280
Your punishment will be brought back right away.

273
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,040
Let's go.

274
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,160
Why are you so aggressive?

275
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,520
You get us in trouble again!

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,400
Erbai!

277
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,760
I'm going to cook.

278
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,760
Captain.

279
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,400
[He left after making trouble.]

280
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,280
[Let's leave]

281
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,920
[and go home.]

282
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,240
Erbai.

283
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,800
Are those words true?

284
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,880
Cross the bridge when you come to it.

285
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
The punishment hasn't come yet.

286
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,400
Go home for dinner.

287
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,040
See you.

288
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,120
[Miss Luo, goodbye.]

289
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,480
[Come in.]

290
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,280
Captain.

291
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,880
[What's up?]

292
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,040
Well,

293
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,200
we might

294
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
not be cops after.

295
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,760
You don't need to

296
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,280
give us the budget for today.

297
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,160
I'll figure it out

298
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,120
myself.

299
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,360
What budget?

300
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,040
For the mission.

301
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,240
Xiang Yuansheng told me

302
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,120
it is dedicated to

303
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,880
the implementation of the mission.

304
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,920
Today, when we shadowed,

305
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,280
we ordered a cup of coffee

306
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,800
and a piece of cake.

307
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,720
Is this enough?

308
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Is there

309
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,240
no mission budget?

310
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,360
Are you worried

311
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,920
about losing your job?

312
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,800
Relax.

313
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,240
I'll write you

314
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
a letter of recommendation

315
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
for easy job hunting.

316
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,600
Thank you.

317
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,640
No problem.

318
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,600
Captain.

319
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,720
Did Xiang Yuansheng

320
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,280
really make a mistake today?

321
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,120
If I were him,

322
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,640
I don't know

323
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,160
what to do.

324
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,520
You know,

325
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
you're kind.

326
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,880
If you wanna

327
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
be a good cop,

328
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,880
do what you think is right.

329
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,800
Go home.

330
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,440
[Why am I gonna lose my job?]

331
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,200
[Stop yelling and crying,]

332
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,240
[please.]

333
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
Stop it.

334
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,640
Luo Minmin,

335
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,600
you're not

336
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,880
the only one

337
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,200
who will lose the job!

338
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,800
You do break

339
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,040
my ears!

340
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,640
I really wanna be a police officer.

341
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,440
Do you think

342
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,320
the God forgets me?

343
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,120
As I said, you're not suitable

344
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,080
for this job.

345
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,840
Nonsense. You doomsayer.

346
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,880
Are you injured?

347
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,760
How did you get injured like this?

348
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,560
Stop yelling!

349
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
I'll take some medicine for you.

350
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,560
Stop making noise!

351
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,400
[Gosh!]

352
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,400
She cries like a pig.

353
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,360
Is she sad

354
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,560
or sick?

355
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,920
She's just sad.

356
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,160
So much?

357
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,760
I think this will

358
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,080
last for several days.

359
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,520
You don't need to stay here.

360
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,040
Go back to sleep.

361
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,920
Do you need help?

362
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,800
No.

363
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,880
Fine.

364
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,640
Minmin.

365
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,960
What's up?

366
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,400
Nothing.

367
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,560
You can go back.

368
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,640
[Mr. Feng and I]

369
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,520
[will sent him to the Council.]

370
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,160
[It's so late.]

371
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,040
[We can do it.]

372
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,760
[The order of Mr. Feng.]

373
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,040
Yes, sir.

374
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
[Why did they arrest you?]

375
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Ah...

376
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
[I cheated some girls]

377
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,040
[to dance halls.]

378
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,560
[My heart was in the right place actually.]

379
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,080
I just wanna help them

380
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,120
find a profitable job.

381
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,160
So is it why Chen Hao arrested you?

382
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,760
Yes.

383
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,440
Anything else?

384
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,080
No, nothing.

385
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,080
Have you been to Van Hwa Hotel?

386
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,160
I...

387
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,760
Do you know a family of people

388
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,000
were murdered there?

389
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,680
I don't know.

390
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,360
Never heard about that.

391
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,880
I don't know.

392
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Really.

393
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,240
Sir.

394
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,760
Where are we going?

395
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,680
Sir,

396
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,400
aren't we going

397
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
to the Council?

398
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
Where are you

399
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,120
about to take me to?

400
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,600
Get off.

401
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,680
Wait...

402
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,320
I...

403
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Sir...

404
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,640
[Where...]

405
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,480
[are we going?]

406
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,200
[Sir...]

407
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Where are you about to take me to?

408
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,960
Sir...

409
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,440
Where...

410
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,880
Sir...

411
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,920
You can't...

412
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,960
Officer...

413
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,080
I...

414
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,600
Excuse me,

415
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,200
how many guests

416
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,840
will the inspector meet?

417
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,920
Next is your turn.

418
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,400
OK.

419
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,360
Great.

420
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,120
Thanks a lot.

421
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
Thank you.

422
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,440
How unfair!

423
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,600
I never thought we need to

424
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,480
read their expressions

425
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,160
and wait for so long

426
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,200
in the Council.

427
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,680
Shame on us!

428
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,120
I'd rather die than coming here

429
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,840
if it weren't an accusation.

430
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,760
Gosh.

431
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,680
What a tone!

432
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,600
I don't think they wanna meet you.

433
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
How can you dress so casually

434
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,960
in such an important occasion?

435
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,600
What's up?

436
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,520
It's my new outfit.

437
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,440
You can't be serious.

438
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
It looks like

439
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,920
a piece of diaper.

440
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,040
I have nothing to say.

441
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,920
[Hey, it's your turn.]

442
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,720
One minute!

443
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,880
Come here.

444
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,760
What is it?

445
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,440
Put it on.

446
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,200
Remember,

447
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,360
we're asking for a favor.

448
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,640
Be polite!

449
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,720
The most important thing is

450
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,960
to bear.

451
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,640
What do you mean?

452
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,480
Hunger attacks me.

453
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm gonna have a bite.

454
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,240
Eat this.

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,720
Ronghua!

456
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,640
[Hurry up.]

457
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,840
Ronghua!

458
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,960
You leave me alone again!

459
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,760
[Quickly!]

460
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,600
Hello.

461
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,680
Hello.

462
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,200
Where is "Mr. Shi"?

463
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,240
You can speak Chinese.

464
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,000
OK.

465
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,360
Where is Ms. Shi?

466
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,640
In 2003.

467
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,640
[Come in.]

468
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Who let you in here?

469
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,440
I don't know.

470
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,280
I'm actually

471
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,200
allowed in.

472
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,760
What are you doing here?

473
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,920
What do you mean by this?

474
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
I don't understand.

475
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,920
OK, whatever.

476
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,440
Ms. Shi.

477
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,080
Inspector.

478
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,880
Fine.

479
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,640
Inspector.

480
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,400
[I come here today]

481
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,360
[to request you to withdraw]

482
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,840
[the accusation]

483
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,320
[against the Fourth Station House.]

484
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,120
All the officers there

485
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,640
are suspended from duty because of this.

486
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,520
They're innocent.

487
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,600
I'll submit

488
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,040
to any punishment

489
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,120
if you can do this.

490
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,480
You're taking the wrong way.

491
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,000
We're not directed against you,

492
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,680
but your behavior

493
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,720
of taking actions injudicially.

494
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,480
Then let's talk about it.

495
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
In the French Concession,

496
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,760
there is the biggest opium den

497
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,680
and the biggest casino.

498
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,880
Bunches of girls

499
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,160
gather in the front of brothels.

500
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,880
They don't even hide

501
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,120
when they meet policemen.

502
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,000
Why does the Police Service

503
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,480
allow this happen?

504
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,920
Because you don't love Shanghai.

505
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,000
You don't care about

506
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,320
anything here.

507
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,440
But my colleagues would rather cross the border

508
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,240
to arrest the suspect.

509
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,080
Do you know why?

510
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,160
As soon as you have

511
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,480
discernment,

512
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
you can absolutely make it clear.

513
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,200
But I won't

514
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,240
put my discernment

515
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,160
and energy

516
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,080
on Chinese policemen

517
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,240
just like you guys.

518
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,520
Policemen are halved into two types.

519
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,760
Those can catch criminals,

520
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
and those can't.

521
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,520
You belong to

522
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,160
the third type.

523
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,440
unwelcome here.

524
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,520
Leave my office now

525
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,680
and

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,160
it's useless to bribe me.

527
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,920
Ms. Shi,

528
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,760
this is

529
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,320
my lunch food that I haven't finished

530
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,480
because of your obstruction.

531
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm not rich enough to bribe you.

532
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,920
Moreover,

533
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,400
you have no idea

534
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,440
what the true policeman is.

535
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,520
Ridiculous.

536
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,920
Anything else?

537
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,680
Your captain left just now

538
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,960
and I think I've made it clear

539
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,160
that I won't withdraw the accusation.

540
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,400
Sorry,

541
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
I was out of line yesterday.

542
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,960
But we still have

543
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,600
some possibilities to negotiate.

544
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,320
The officer with you

545
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,400
yesterday said

546
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
the Council

547
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,520
also want to

548
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,760
find the murderer.

549
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,200
Now I have the clues.

550
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,000
You might overestimate

551
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
my concern about this case.

552
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
Mr. Meng and I

553
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,800
just have

554
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
some public affairs communication.

555
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,240
But the Council

556
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,520
wanna find the murderer indeed.

557
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,600
Only in this way,

558
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,920
can you give an explanation

559
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,240
to the industrialists

560
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,920
who pays taxes

561
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,760
in the French Concession

562
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,680
like Mr. Meng.

563
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,920
The suspect

564
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
I caught

565
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,680
witnessed the scene.

566
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,000
Now Shiliupu Police Station

567
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,840
has taken him away.

568
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,640
Only the accusation is withdrawn,

569
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,880
can we investigate the truth

570
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,000
and find out the murderer.

571
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
I don't know who you are yet.

572
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,880
I am

573
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,920
Xiang Yuansheng.

574
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,200
Is your credential accessible?

575
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,600
I don't totally trust Chinese policemen.

576
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,680
How can you confirm

577
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
the man is a witness?

578
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,320
That day,

579
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,440
I met him at Van Hwa Hotel.

580
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,680
He acknowledged this.

581
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,720
So you lived in the hotel.

582
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,000
Sorry,

583
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,760
but I don't wanna talk

584
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,720
about my private affairs.

585
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,640
I went to there

586
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,800
because the Central Patrol

587
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,680
saw you

588
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,000
and reported

589
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,320
to our director.

590
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,000
So this case can't be

591
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,520
decided by myself now.

592
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
But

593
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,920
I'll try to help you.

594
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,520
Thanks.

595
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,640
Inspector Shi,

596
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,840
I heard that a Chinese policeman

597
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,320
requested you for negotiation

598
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
and you agreed to withdraw the accusation.

599
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,920
Not sure. Is the director available now?

600
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,600
Yes, you can get inside.

601
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,440
Luna.

602
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,680
Has the director asked

603
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,640
for the takeover of that suspect

604
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,240
by Shiliupu Police Station?

605
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,320
No.

606
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,200
The Station asked for it.

607
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,640
Thank you.

608
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,920
Put it away.

609
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,400
Have you convinced her?

610
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,880
No.

611
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,080
But someone else did.

612
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,360
Who?

613
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,840
[Wonton is ready.]

614
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,000
Help me please.

615
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,160
You haven't explained to me.

616
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,080
Where are you going?

617
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,840
Do you need a haircut?

618
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,680
How long will it be?

619
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,160
[Ten more minutes]

620
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,440
[for this gentleman.]

621
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,600
I'm in a hurry, maybe next time.

622
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,560
Sure.

623
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,320
Here's your coffee.

624
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,240
Here's your coffee.

625
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,120
Thanks.

626
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,280
Are you

627
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,480
following me for something emergency?

628
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,440
Let's come straight to the question.

629
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,440
You disguised yourself as a policeman,

630
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,160
broke into the Concession for the murder,

631
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,280
and went to the Council

632
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,400
for negotiation.

633
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,160
I wonder

634
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
why you're so interested

635
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,400
in the case.

636
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,960
Do you know Mr. Meng?

637
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,680
No.

638
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,120
Have you received a task

639
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,240
to investigate?

640
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,480
I don't wanna talk

641
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,440
about my private affairs.

642
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,520
I don't think it's your personal affairs.

643
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,920
It's a captain's duty

644
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
to understand his group members.

645
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,600
Your credential

646
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,960
shows your name,

647
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,240
age and job.

648
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,520
All of this seems to

649
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
contradict you.

650
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,880
That's a record of the situation then.

651
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I changed my job

652
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,240
to be a policeman.

653
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,840
The credential doesn't lie.

654
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,120
And people sure change.

655
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,080
So you've changed.

656
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,440
[Are you a coffee person?]

657
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,520
Sort of.

658
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,920
Sir,

659
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,640
here's your packed

660
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,080
freshly baked bread,

661
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,640
and the bill.

662
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,160
Thank you.

663
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,320
Honestly,

664
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,160
it's weird to drink coffee with you.

665
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,400
Since we've been suspended,

666
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,480
[you're not my captain]

667
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,640
[at present.]

668
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,600
Please stay away

669
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,840
from my private life.

670
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,120
Sir, here's your bill.

671
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,080
Has that gentleman

672
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,240
not paid for all yet?

673
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,240
Just for

674
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,320
his own.

675
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,200
So expensive.

676
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,200
Thank you.

677
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,280
You're back!

678
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
I have

679
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,720
finished my homework

680
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,080
and milk as well.

681
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,040
I just bought some

682
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,480
fresh bread and milk.

683
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,400
So much!

684
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Little girl should drink

685
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,720
more milk to keep your body strong.

686
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,760
I have told you

687
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm not a little girl.

688
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,560
Alright.

689

Hi.

694
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,520

695
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,360

Duoci's parents entrusted to me

711
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,880
before their death.

712
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,680
Can I talk to her alone?

713
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,560
As quickly as possible.

714
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,600
This way.

715
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,440
I was sent to Hong Kong

716
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,600
for business for half a month.

717
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,280
I was informed of your experience

718
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,640
on the boat back to Shanghai.

719
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,600
I've been

720
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,840
looking for you.

721
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,760
I never thought I'd meet you here.

722
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,720
I didn't get hurt at all.

723
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,120
Yuansheng saved me.

724
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,920
Don't worry.

725
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,000
Have you met him before?

726
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
No.

727
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,120
But someone

728
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
asked him to send us something.

729
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,360
What is it?

730
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,720
A book.

731
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,400
Someone hid our boat tickets

732
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,160
and credentials inside

733
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,880
and asked him to give it to us.

734
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,760
Is that what he told you?

735
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,360
In Van Hwa Hotel,

736
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,520
there's a man

737
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,720
staying with us.

738
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,560
One of the 3 new credentials

739
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,040
has the name of Xiang Yuansheng on it.

740
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,560
It should have belonged to the man.

741
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,240
To become a policeman

742
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,480
to find the murderer,

743
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,680
Yuansheng

744
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,720
borrowed the name.

745
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,520
And his real name is Hua Zhen.

746
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,880
Hua Zhen?

747
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,320
So has he come to Shanghai

748
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,360
from Nanjing?

749
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,080
How

750
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,800
do you know that?
