Shooting Stars EP10

3
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,640
Hi, Mrs. Ji.

4
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,760
Ms. Shi.

5
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,400
I've altered the clothes

6
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,440
you sent over.

7
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
I heard you're in a hurry,

8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
since I was passing by,

9
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,520
I brought them to you.

10
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,560
Thank you.

11
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Something happened to Meng Duoci.

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,440
Qiushi!

13
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,160
Qiushi!

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,720
Xiang Yuansheng!

15
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,160
What are you doing here?

16
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Arranged by the Captain.

17
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,440
I'll keep a watch here.

18
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Don't worry.

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,920
Be careful.

20
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,920
Qiushi!

21
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Qiushi!

22
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,640
Qiushi!

23
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Qiushi!

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,240
Qiushi!

25
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,160
Qiushi!

26
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Qiushi!

27
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Qiushi!

28
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Qiushi!

29
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,120
Qiushi!

30
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,880
Wait a minute!

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,040
What's up?

32
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Where did you find this hairband?

33
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,360
Just over there,

34
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,720
near a trash can.

35
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,160
Thanks.

36
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
Are you injured?

37
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,960
No.

38
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,160
Gosh.

39
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,400
Thank God.

40
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,400
Don't be afraid.

41
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,000
You're safe now.

42
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,880
Meng Duoci.

43
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,960
Excuse me, where did the patient just go?

44
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
I didn't see.

45
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,640
Yuansheng!

46
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,680
Your sister has been found.

47
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Is she alright?

48
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,080
She's fine.

49
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
Keep others informed, please.

50
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,200
Alright.

51
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,560
Sir,

52
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,280
have you seen a girl

53
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,760
about this tall,

54
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
with two braids?

55
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,320
No.

56
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,840
Done?

57
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,720
Wait a minute!

58
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,440
Sir,

59
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
how did you get hurt?

60
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,960
Wait.

61
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,520
Do you need help?

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,520
Stop there!

63
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,280
Or I'll blow my whistle!

64
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,200
Which police station are you from?

65
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,640
Just around the corner.

66
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
Hold on tight.

67
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,200
Help...

68
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,520
Captain.

69
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Has she been found?

70
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
Inside.

71
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,880
Is she okay?

72
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,520
All good.

73
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,080
Where did you find her?

74
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,200
In a trash can.

75
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,720
Are you alright?

76
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,400
No worries.

77
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,280
You have a sister?

78
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,720
She's been living in Shanghai.

79
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,560
Hi,

80
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,400
what's your name?

81
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,000
Li Qiushi.

82
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,600
And you...

83
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,320
Qiushi!

84
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,120
Qiushi!

85
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,920
Are you alright?

86
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Did you get hurt?

87
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,160
Ms. Shi,

88
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm okay.

89
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,760
Yuansheng saved me.

90
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,520
Thank you.

91
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,680
Thank you all.

92
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
Just doing our job.

93
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,520
I didn't expect you

94
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
to know Yuansheng's sister.

95
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,080
I found out not long ago that

96
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
Ms. Shi was my sister's French teacher.

97
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
You're learning German,

98
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,880
and your sister's learning French?

99
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Is there a problem?

100
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
She's pretty impressive,

101
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,640
even knew how to escape on her own.

102
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,080
Minmin taught me.

103
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,720
Good for her!

104
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,720
Where's Minmin?

105
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,080
Where is she?

106
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,560
I've...

107
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,200
blown the whistle for ages.

108
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,320
She'd have been back by now.

109
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,160
Quickly!

110
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,040
Keep blowing!

111
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't go...

112
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,720
Ms. Shi,

113
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,360
Qiushi...

114
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,720
Leave her to me.

115
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,440
You go find Miss Luo.

116
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,880
Your man

117
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,800
has been sent to the hospital.

118
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,600
He said this dagger was used by the killer.

119
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Yuansheng,

120
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
you'll find

121
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,360
Minmin,

122
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
won't you?

123
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Don't worry.

124
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,120
Minmin might be in danger.

125
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
Let's search under the streetlights.

126
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay.

127
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,680
Minmin!

128
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,760
Minmin!

129
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,400
Minmin!

130
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,080
Minmin!

131
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,480
Minmin!

132
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,080
Miss Luo!

133
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,000
Minmin!

134
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,480
Minmin!

135
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,080
She's not here.

136
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,840
Minmin!

137
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,200
Yuansheng!

138
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,440
Xiang Yuansheng!

139
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,480
Follow him!

140
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:27,720
Yes, sir!

141
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,320
Erbai, come with me!

142
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,320
Luo Minmin!

143
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,320
Miss Luo!

144
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,800
Minmin!

145
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,480
Minmin!

146
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,200
Miss Luo!

147
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,840
Could this be

148
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,080
Miss Luo's hat?

149
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,680
A baton.

150
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Blood.

151
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,960
Minmin...

152
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,320
Luo Minmin!

153
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
Why is there still blood?

154
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
Could something bad have happened to her?

155
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,320
So much blood.

156
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,800
Yuansheng!

157
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,960
Captain!

158
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,160
There's

159
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,240
blood on the truck!

160
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,600
Yuansheng headed that way!

161
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,680
Move!

162
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,480
Minmin!

163
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,200
Minmin!

164
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,720
Minmin!

165
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Hongfa, come help me!

166
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,600
Come on!

167
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,560
Over here!

168
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,720
Hurry up!

169
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,720
Erbai, support her head.

170
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,400
Easy.

171
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,360
Okay, easy.

172
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,360
Easy.

173
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,280
Drive!

174
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,680
Go, drive!

175
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,960
Minmin...

176
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,040
She won't die, right?

177
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,760
Minmin...

178
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,200
So much blood...

179
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,120
She won't die, right?

180
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,480
She will be okay,

181
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:21,960
right?

182
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,640
Who did this?

183
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,240
Say it!

184
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,760
I don't know!

185
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,160
I really don't know!

186
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,400
I just

187
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,800
parked by the roadside

188
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,000
to deliver vegetables to a restaurant.

189
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,120
I didn't know

190
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,000
someone was

191
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,240
in my truck!

192
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,200
Captain!

193
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,760
I had no idea!

194
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,360
Captain!

195
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,880
I'm serious.

196
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,720
A button in Minmin's hand!

197
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,040
Find all the clues

198
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,200
related to this button!

199
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,480
Go! Go!

200
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,640
Erbai, ready?

201
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,000
All set!

202
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Xiang Yuansheng,

203
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm taking her to the hospital.

204
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,320
- Xiang Yuansheng! - Get up!

205
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,960
Erbai, go!

206
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,640
C'mon,

207
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,480
go with me.

208
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
Bring her to the hospital now!

209
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,400
Go!

210
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,200
Help!

211
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,960
Help!

212
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,040
Doctor!

213
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,280
Anybody here!

214
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,760
Help!

215
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,400
Doctor!

216
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,000
Help!

217
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,200
Doctor!

218
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,800
Somebody help!

219
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,480
Doctor!

220
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,400
Help!

221
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,360
Doctor!

222
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,040
Stretcher!

223
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Injuries to her head and legs!

224
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,440
Unconscious for a while!

225
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,120
Emergency treatment!

226
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,000
Erbai, help.

227
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,200
Slowly.

228
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,720
Minmin...

229
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,360
hold up.

230
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,240
Minmin.

231
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,480
Wait here!

232
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,400
Minmin...

233
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,560
Come with me.

234
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,040
Why would the killer go to your house?

235
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,560
He wasn't looking for me,

236
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,200
but for Li Qiushi.

237
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,480
Tell me why.

238
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,520
Remember Mr. Meng

239
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,400
has a daughter?

240
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,480
Is she Meng Duoci?

241
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,720
Yes.

242
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,400
Then,

243
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,240
who are you?

244
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,480
Just a passerby.

245
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,520
I stumbled upon

246
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,240
the murder at Van Hwa Hotel,

247
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
and upon her.

248
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,120
But where's

249
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,640
Xiang Yuansheng's credential?

250
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm entrusted by a friend.

251
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Who is that?

252
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,640
I can't say.

253
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,440
I need to know now!

254
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,520
I can't answer that!

255
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,040
I made a promise to him!

256
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,120
What about Luo Minmin's promise

257
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
and the Fourth Station's?

258
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm sorry.

259
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,560
When I decided

260
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,840
to stay in Shanghai,

261
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,960
I thought it's

262
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,000
my own affair,

263
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,440
and I made my decision alone.

264
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,720
I was wrong.

265
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,280
The moment I stepped

266
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,160
into the Fourth Station,

267
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,480
everyone there

268
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,720
got involved.

269
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,880
I just never thought

270
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,880
that you would be the ones

271
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
to bear the consequences.

272
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,760
I assume that

273
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,160
you're right to keep her identity

274
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,000
confidential.

275
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,320
For safety,

276
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,840
you can keep it

277
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,080
until we catch the killer.

278
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,920
I must catch

279
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,240
this bastard myself.

280
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,240
Miss Luo...

281
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,160
How is she?

282
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,920
Hongfa,

283
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,760
have you ever helped someone who's drunk?

284
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,680
No matter how drunk they are,

285
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,520
you can

286
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,200
feel their bones holding them up.

287
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
But when I was holding Minmin,

288
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,480
she felt like a sack of rice...

289
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,120
completely

290
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,280
collapsed.

291
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,120
I was thinking,

292
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,200
she wouldn't slowly

293
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,360
but surely

294
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,280
leak away

295
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,640
like rice,

296
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,040
would she?

297
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,920
I've been a cop for four years.

298
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,480
This is the first time I've felt terrifying.

299
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,840
Minmin...

300
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,200
she will be okay.

301
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,440
Stop crying.

302
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,720
She'll be alright.

303
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,960
Which station are you from?

304
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Shiliupu Police Station.

305
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,800
An order for Deputy Director Tan.

306
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,640
Guest inside.

307
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,240
Please wait.

308
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,720
For how long?

309
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm not sure.

310
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,800
Mr. Feng,

311
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,480
you can go in now.

312
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,640
It may not be

313
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
convenient now.

314
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,040
There's a regular visitor

315
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,200
of Mr. Tan.

316
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,120
You're

317
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,880
allowed in.

318
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,240
Good evening, Mr. Tan.

319
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,800
Sir,

320
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,200
have some tea.

321
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,160
I'll make you an introduction.

322
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,600
This is

323
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,160
our regular guest,

324
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,040
Mr. Nakamura Naoki

325
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,480
from Hongji Benevolent Society.

326
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,880
You should know that.

327
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,560
Of course.

328
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,000
We send officers

329
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,040
there every week

330
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
to keep order

331
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,200
to among the refugees.

332
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,000
If it weren't for Mr. Nakamura's

333
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,160
generous distribution

334
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
of food and medicine,

335
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,440
we'd

336
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,400
need three times the effort

337
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,880
to prevent them

338
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,240
from causing trouble.

339
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,040
It's a consensus.

340
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,480
So,

341
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,760
Mr. Nakamura,

342
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,720
you are currently

343
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,000
our most welcomed guest.

344
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
I learned compassion

345
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,480
from

346
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,560
the Chinese people.

347
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,280
I know it's not easy for you

348
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
to maintain the order.

349
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,480
Thank you.

350
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,360
It's our duty.

351
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,760
Hello, Mr. Feng,

352
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,480
It's the first time we've met.

353
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,480
Nice to meet you.

354
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,840
I am

355
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,960
greatly flattered.

356
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,800
The man

357
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,520
I sent to 23 Wangyun Road

358
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,760
to find Meng Duoci

359
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,800
encountered several policemen.

360
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,040
Do you know

361
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,440
what happened just now?

362
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,760
23 Wangyun Road?

363
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,920
Mr. Nakamura received information

364
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,720
that Meng Duoci is staying there.

365
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,240
His man

366
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,960
has already

367
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,120
located her.

368
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,960
But the sudden arrival of the police

369
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,000
disrupted everything.

370
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,000
Were they local patrol officers?

371
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,880
No.

372
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,920
They arrested a man in the Concession before.

373
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,560
That's why

374
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,120
I brought you here.

375
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,720
Fourth Station again.

376
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,200
Mr. Feng,

377
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,280
how did they end up

378
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,800
at Meng Duoci's home?

379
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm sorry,

380
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,040
I was not

381
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,560
aware of this

382
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,680
before I came here.

383
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm gonna figure it out.

384
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,880
Also,

385
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
a female officer

386
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,280
saw my man.

387
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,240
She could

388
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,640
become a problem.

389
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,120
Handling this trouble

390
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,920
is now up to you both.

391
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,720
I'm here on orders from

392
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,760
the Army Ministry to build a rear base,

393
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,600
and I appreciate

394
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,360
your support so far.

395
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,480
I regard you both

396
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,960
as comrades in territory expansion.

397
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
Regarding Meng,

398
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,480
please continue to support us.

399
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,120
Thank you.

400
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
Take care.

401
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,680
Again the Fourth Police Station!

402
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,160
I've transferred the murder case

403
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,800
from them

404
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,720
to you

405
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,480
personally handle it.

406
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,360
Yet they should

407
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
show up at Meng Duoci's home!

408
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,160
Can't you manage

409
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,000
just one police station?

410
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm going there now

411
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,400
to clarify all this.

412
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,880
Come back!

413
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Go to the police hospital first.

414
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,680
Nakamura's man

415
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,320
injured a

416
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,160
female officer.

417
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,480
Go check

418
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
what she's known.

419
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,800
She definitely saw

420
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
his face.

421
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,720
Is Nakamura

422
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,280
suggesting we silence her?

423
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,240
We cannot do exactly as he said.

424
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,760
Killing a police officer

425
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,200
would bring us

426
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,800
too many complications.

427
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,920
Nakamura might not consider this,

428
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,400
but we must.

429
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,240
Go,

430
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,200
understand the situation first.

431
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,280
Got it.

432
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,480
Why the rush?

433
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Do you know

434
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,440
why I'm

435
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
so close to Nakamura?

436
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,480
Do you know what

437
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,680
the Society does?

438
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,760
Through its

439
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,000
underground dealings,

440
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,240
Nakamura Naoki has provided

441
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,440
substantial funds for the Army Ministry.

442
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,080
His position there

443
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,800
is hence significant.

444
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,320
The reason why I cooperated with him

445
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
and released his goods

446
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,480
is that if possible,

447
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,680
after the Japanese occupied Shanghai,

448
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,360
you and I still have a place

449
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,320
to live here.

450
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,680
So I don't want

451
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,960
him storming

452
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,600
into my office

453
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,160
over such issues again.

454
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,320
Even if

455
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,480
we didn't capture

456
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,880
Meng Duoci,

457
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,160
Nakamura

458
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,960
wouldn't turn against us, right?

459
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,560
After all, he said

460
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,200
we're comrades

461
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,760
in territory expansion.

462
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,920
Do you think

463
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
he traded us for being part of his

464
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,720
secret organization

465
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,680
by asking us to do things for him?

466
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,360
Or we have a closer,

467
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,320
stronger, and indispensable relationship

468
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,480
with him as a result?

469
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,000
You haven't realized yet

470
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,240
that we've been in a situation

471
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,080
beyond our control

472
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,880
and mindset.

473
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,920
No one knows

474
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,840
which direction history will take.

475
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,160
So

476
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,400
don't be swayed

477
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,000
by empty rhetoric

478
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,280
and false sense of belonging.

479
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,560
What we can do

480
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,480
is to try the best

481
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,360
to look out for ourselves.

482
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,120
Director.

483
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,040
What's happening?

484
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,480
Speak up!

485
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,320
How is she?

486
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,640
She needs a drip!

487
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:47,960
How?

488
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,240
From critical to serious.

489
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
But it's hard to say

490
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,560
when she'll wake up.

491
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,360
Gosh.

492
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,920
It's just a case.

493
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,320
Why risk your life for it?

494
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,960
What can I say about you?

495
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,640
She's just a young girl...

496
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,680
Calm down.

497
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,480
Minmin.

498
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,560
Can you hear me?

499
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,280
Open your eyes for me, please.

500
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,680
Please.

501
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,320
How did this happen?

502
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,560
Does it hurt?

503
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,280
Minmin?

504
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,200
Are you in pain?

505
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,680
Dad and our brother

506
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
are all here.

507
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,640
Wake up,

508
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,680
please.

509
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,440
How did it get to this?

510
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,800
How?

511
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,800
Minmin, look at me.

512
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,160
Say something.

513
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,960
Didn't you always say that God

514
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,360
cares you the most?

515
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,000
Leave us alone.

516
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,600
Minmin...

517
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Please.

518
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,280
Mr. Luo, I'm sorry

519
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,120
I didn't protect her well.

520
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,960
Get out!

521
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,760
Are you in pain?

522
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,000
Wake up.

523
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,200
Didn't you say that God

524
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,520
takes special care of you?

525
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Minmin...

526
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,440
What do we do?

527
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,680
Dad!

528
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,280
Minmin...

529
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,440
Dad, what should we do?

530
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,600
Is she in pain?

531
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,840
Are you in pain?
