00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,840
the S.M.C. is the cradle of the revolutionary navy.

178
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,600
If war ever comes,

179
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,480
the elite class

180
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,280
will be the vanguard of the new navy.

181
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,320
[Do you really think]

182
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,200
the government will fight with Japan?

183
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,280
Last year,

184
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,960
the Communist Party

185
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,680
issued the August First Declaration

186
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,400
at the National Salvation Newspaper.

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,600
We read it at school.

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,240
[The Chinese nation]

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,200
[is at a critical point]

190
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,800
[of survival.]

191
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,440
Resisting Japanese aggression

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
is the top task facing all Chinese.

193
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,720
At least that's true.

194
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,320
As father said,

195
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,080
you can stay out of politics,

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,560
but you can't be insensitive

197
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,440
or cautious.

198
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
Since Minister He

199
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,720
took office,

200
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,520
internal disputes have been constant.

201
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
[You are the son of the deputy minister.]

202
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,560
[Don't say]

203
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,280
these again

204
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,080
even at home.

205
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,400
Liang,

206
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,160
resisting aggression is not politics.

207
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,840
The chaos in Guangdong and Guangxi

208
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,080
was in such a name.

209
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,560
Then what?

210
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,760
Cantonese Military fell apart.

211
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
Chen Jitang immediately

212
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,800
stole into Hong Kong.

213
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,520
[Isn't this politics?]

214
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,840
[What is that?]

215
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,080
Thanks.

216
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,600
Sir.

217
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Your invitation please.

218
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I was in such a hurry

220
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,880
that I forgot

221
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,440
it.

222
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,920
This is my identity card.

223
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm a former subordinate of the deputy minister.

224
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,320
Captain.

225
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,600
This is the home of the deputy minister He.

226
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,160
So what?

227
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,920
It's no use asking anyone for help.

228
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Let's

229
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,720
go get him out.

230
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,960
Excuse me,

231
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
your invitation please.

232
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,720
We come from

233
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,440
the Shanghai Garrison Command.

234
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
We're on a mission.

235
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,920
What happened?

236
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,000
Captain.

237
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,760
They're from

238
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,800
the Shanghai Garrison Command.

239
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,120
We've been

240
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,600
tracking a man.

241
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,800
He's allowed in just now.

242
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
We wanna go in to find him

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,040
for some words.

244
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
Could you do us a favor?

245
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Today is deputy minister's birthday.

246
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm sorry I can't help you.

247
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,040
We are

248
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,920
on a public mission.

249
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,040
For this reason,

250
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,520
no one ever stopped us

251
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,680
when we're in Shanghai.

252
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,280
Here is the capital

253
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,080
Nanjing,

254
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,000
not Shanghai.

255
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,720
Sorry for that.

256
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,600
[Mr. Deng.]

257
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,960
C'mon mate,

258
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,440
we are all soldiers,

259
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,200
and both on our mission.

260
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
Understanding is appreciated.

261
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,280
Imagine

262
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,480
what would happen if something wrong

263
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,600
with the man.

264
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,280
We may make trouble for Mr. He.

265
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,520
How about this?

266
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,560
I'll go in alone

267
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,800
and won't cause you any trouble.

268
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,080
Just 10 minutes.

269
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm from Phase II

Long time no see!

274
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,320
I didn't expect

275
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,520
to see you here

276
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,680
at your dad's birthday party.

277
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,440
I'm on vacation.

278
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
And I just arrived in Nanjing today.

279
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,280
Mr. Deng,

280
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,200
let me take you to my father.

281
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,720
Wait.

283
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,680
I was all sweaty.

284
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,560
It's an indecent way

285
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,440
to meet your father.

286
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,560
Would you mind taking me to tidy up?

287
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,160
Once inside,

288
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,440
act cautiously.

289
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,320
Do you remember?

290
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,400
In 1924, the former premier

291

[You're the second officer.]

293

I was 12 at that time

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,720
and attended the ceremony with my father.

295
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,680
Luckily, I was on board with you,

297

to join the navy

528
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,480
Hey you, stop!

529
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,360
Stay there.

530
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,080
I'm the police.

531
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,360
Do you live in this hotel?

532
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,520
No.

533
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,880
I'm here to visit my friend.

534
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,480
Have you heard

535
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,520
something strange around?

536
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,040
No.

537
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,800
Have you met

538
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,000
someone weird moving about?

539
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,400
No.

540
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,560
Or have you seen a child

541
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,760
holding a sugar-coated figurine?

542
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,160
Sorry,

543
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,680
no.

544
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,280
Do you live nearby?

545
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,520
Tell me your address

546
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,720
and we need you for a statement.

547
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,480
Sorry.

548
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,680
I'm here to travel

549
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,480
and will leave tomorrow.

550
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm afraid I can't help you.

551
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,560
Why do you bring an English book when traveling?

552
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,200
It's German.

553
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,320
Sir,

554
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
can I leave now?

555
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,160
The security in the vicinity is not good.

556
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,640
Don't wander about.

557
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,920
Don't go in there!

558
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,240
Get out!

559
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,040
What happened here?

560
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,240
Which room does your friend live in?

561
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,120
Show me

562
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,960
your check-in registration.

563
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,720
OK.

564
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,600
Turn to that page.

565
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,440
Who did this?

566
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,600
It's me.

567
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,720
A temporary warning line.

568
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,520
Your certificate.

569
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,680
Fule Station House?

570
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
I'm Chen Hao,

571
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,440
the capital of the Fourth Station House

572
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,240
under the Shiliupu Police Station.

573
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,280
[The 3 deceased]

574
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,760
[were given throat cuts with sharp tools.]

575
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,480
[Only a young man]

576
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,000
[registered for the resident.]

577
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,280
[Based on bed allocation,]

578
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,040
[the other two]

579
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,200
[are couples.]

580
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,200
There are also

581
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,440
some clothes for a child.

582
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,000
A kid is supposed to live here.

583
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,560
Tenants around

584
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,960
didn't hear anything strange.

585
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,520
[No witness for now.]

586
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,440
Anything else?

587
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,160
I found this in the front

588
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,800
of the door.

589
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,880
Basically,

590
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,000
children would buy such stuff.

591
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,920
It may fall

592
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,960
out of the girl who lived in the room.

593
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,920
If she was in the room,

594
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,440
she might have been abducted

595
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,200
or have escaped already.

596
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,840
I have checked

597
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,640
the clothes.

598
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,600
For a girl around 6 or 7 years old.

599
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,800
Good job.

600
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,960
Have you caught the suspect

601
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,440
in the previous case?

602
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,040
Not yet.

603
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,400
Take it.

604
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,360
Do your own job.

605
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,800
We will take over this case.

606
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,640
Captain's out.

607
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,240
Cap.

608
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
[Do your own job.]

609
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,800
[We will take over this case.]

610
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,200
Cap.

611
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,960
Captain.

612
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,400
The overalls have gone.

613
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,880
We didn't catch up.

614
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,120
Then keep doing.

615
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,520
Here comes a new case.

616
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,080
Another one?

617
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:39,920
Can you

618
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,640
persuade the leader

619
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,840
to assign it to other houses?

620
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
You've crouched the overalls

621
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,520
at the ballroom for two days.

622
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,760
Don't you feel tired?

623
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
You need a bath!

624
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,560
The overalls

625
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,000
fled to a restaurant

626
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,120
in order to hide from us.

627
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,200
We're all exhausted

628
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,360
for endless manhunt.

629
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,040
Alright, then take a break,

630
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,800
have a bath,

631
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,720
take more spare sets of clothes,

632
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,000
and prepare to live in the office.

633
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,760
What? Again?

634
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,480
Fine.

635
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,080
Stop complaining

Stay outside.

644
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,200
Hello,

He's not here.

No.

We live here.

675

Then why do you live in the hotel?

676
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
Dad said our house was in water leakage.

677

We're about

678

to move to Guangzhou.

679
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,880
We just lived in the hotel for some days.

680
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,560
We'll leave

681
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,160
as long as we receive the boat tickets

682
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,840
and new credentials.

683
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,280
Is your name Li Qiushi?

No, I'm

Meng Duoci.

686
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,920
Why it is Li Qiushi

687
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,200
on the credential?

688
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,640
Dad said

689
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,760
we need to use a new name

690
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,240
after reaching Guangzhou.

691
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,320
But

692

he didn't tell me why.

693
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,280
Are they your parents?

694

What about him called Xiang Yuansheng?

695
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,680
He's dad's friend

696
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,280
and this name is fake too.
