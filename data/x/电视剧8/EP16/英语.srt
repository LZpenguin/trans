from the "Central Daily" today.

have already crossed Huining.

After Huining, it's a foregone conclusion.

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,720
that the Chairman intends to establish

26

No.

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
[Now,]

177
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,120
[we no longer have]

178
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,600
[the luxury of ease.]

179
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,880
[Their sacrifices are worthy.]

180
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,480
The organization

181
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,120
has activated Comrade Chen Hao.

182
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,400
He has now

183
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,920
become the fifth 037.

184
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,960
This code will not disappear.

185
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,200
Operation ISKRA

186
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
will continue

187
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
until the day

188
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
of victory.

189
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
That is a promise

190
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,080
of the CPC and the organization.

191
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,760
Eat now, or the noodles will get soggy.

192
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,400
Get ready!

193
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,160
What's on your mind?

194
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,760
You go back.

195
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,040
I need to stay.

196
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,640
But we've been

197
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,440
ordered for extradition.

198
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Without getting the money from the bank

199
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,680
and finding that hidden child,

200
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,640
I won't return.

201
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,920
We've fought before.

202
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,840
You're a soldier too,

203
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,640
right?

204
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,680
If you truly are,

205
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,240
then you should understand

206
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,920
that China's issue

207
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,400
can no longer be resolved peacefully.

208
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,400
War is the only solution.

209
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,960
I know you

210
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,520
have taken

211
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,000
the money from the bank.

212
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,480
Even if you manage to protect those kids,

213
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,800
it's futile.

214
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,600
Every industrial site

215
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,880
along your coast,

216
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,400
every new railway

217
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,960
leading inland,

218
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,040
all have been

219
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,720
marked on our maps.

220
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,560
Once our

221
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,440
forces start,

222
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,800
it will only take

223
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
ten days to break open your defense.

224
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,320
The kids from the ISKRA,

225
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,440
we will find them eventually.

226
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
Including Meng Duoci,

227
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,080
none of them will escape.

228
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,000
Extradition is the bottom line.

229
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,080
You shouldn't have left the ship.

230
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,920
Move!

231
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,480
Step aside!

232
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,160
I've told you before,

233
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,880
about my teacher Deng Mingyuan.

234
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,840
He was executed

235
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,480
today at

236
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,960
Nanjing Central Military Prison.

237
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,680
Because he was a communist.

238
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,040
This is the last letter

239
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,200
he left me.

240
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,680
This should put an end to the matter.

241
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,240
What are your plans next?

242
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,160
Before coming to Shanghai,

243
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,400
my life

244
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
was never influenced by external forces.

245
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Thus, I never truly

246
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
experienced life itself.

247
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,200
Only now do I start to realize,

248
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,240
maybe my path has changed.

249
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,120
Maybe everyone's path

250
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,280
is meant to change.

251
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,120
Who knows?

252
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Yeah,

253
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
who knows.

254
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Go home.

255
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,240
You've been away too long.

256
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Go back.

257
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,520
Did you find Takagi?

258
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,520
Found him by the river.

259
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
Shot twice,

260
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,200
already dead.

261
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,320
Mr. Feng is looking for witnesses.

262
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,840
It might

263
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,280
take some time.

264
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,000
Looks like it might turn into a cold case.

265
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,000
No worries,

266
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,000
we'll do everything

267
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
to catch the killer.

268
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,200
The money in the bank

269
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,040
has also been taken.

270
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,120
It's too late.

271
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,480
The Meng couple and the communists

272
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,960
were doing more

273
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,520
than just feeding

274
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,720
those kids.

275
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,200
The kids you're worried about

276
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,360
are just a few hundred.

277
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,680
They're still

278
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,040
blank slates.

279
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,200
Even in three to five years,

280
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,840
they might not pose a threat.

281
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,240
Do you know

282
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,720
what's the most terrifying aspect of war? (in Japanese)

283
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,720
Do you know

284
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
what's the most terrifying aspect of war?

285
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,840
It isn't your

286
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,240
industrial sites along the coast,

287
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,400
nor the increasing number

288
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,160
of railways leading to the inland.

289
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,000
China's real strength

290
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
doesn't lie there.

291
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,720
This land is primal.

292
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,000
Its roots are buried in the soil.

293
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,280
As long as there's rainfall and sunlight,

294
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,040
the rice will grow.

295
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,960
That's why this nation

296
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
is so hard to eradicate.

297
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,960
What do you think

298
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Nakamura's attitude towards us really is?

299
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,960
You mean his last remarks?

300
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah.

301
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,480
Crops growing

302
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
and being hard to eradicate?

303
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,960
What does he mean?

304
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,240
Is he fighting us

305
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,720
while praising us?

306
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,320
For someone who harbors ambition

307
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,920
but lacks morality,

308
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,640
those words

309
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,320
are merely

310
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,000
out of frustration for not being able to

311
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,200
annihilate us in a few days.

312
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,440
If you genuinely think

313
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,240
he's praising

314
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,560
or admiring us,

315
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
that's too naive.

316
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,560
But we work for the Japanese.

317
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,480
Don't we need to foster good relations?

318
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm focused on amassing something to bargain with.

319
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,240
As for relations,

320
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,400
mutual respect

321
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,560
is good.

322
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,680
Deputy Director,

323
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,000
I'll just follow your lead.

324
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,240
I prefer not to dwell on those

325
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
overly complex matters.

326
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,200
Guangyun, sit down.

327
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,600
Nakamura is clearly

328
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,480
bothered

329
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,840
by Takagi Tamaki's murder.

330
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,800
I overlooked

331
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,080
that matter.

332
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,560
But he shouldn't have

333
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,240
gone off on his own.

334
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,840
Did he really think

335
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,080
he was invincible?

336
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,800
Well,

337
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,760
any clues yet?

338
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,000
I spoke with the harbor patrol.

339
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,880
Someone heard

340
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,360
gunshots near the warehouse,

341
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,400
but by the time they arrived,

342
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,520
there was no one there.

343
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,680
No witnesses

344
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,280
or weapon found yet.

345
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,120
However,

346
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,680
I think the most likely suspect

347
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,520
is the person

348
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,240
who stayed in the apartment with Meng Duoci.

349
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,200
I checked the registry.

350
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,280
His name is Hua Zhen.

351
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,080
What did you say?

352
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,000
His name is Hua Zhen.

353
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Feng Sir,

354
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
if you had

355
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,800
informed me earlier,

356
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,440
it wouldn't have

357
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,880
escalated to this point.

358
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,880
I don't follow.

359
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
Stop focusing on Hua Zhen.

360
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Direct your efforts

361
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,280
towards the journalist from

362
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,680
the national salvation organization.

363
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,160
He shouldn't take

364
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,560
those photos.

365
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,160
This issue

366
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,880
is trickier than the Meng case.

367
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,480
We have

368
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,600
the journalist in custody,

369
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,880
and we've retrieved the photos.

370
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,240
Just

371
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,120
haven't got the negatives yet.

372
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,240
He's just a frail journalist.

373
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,080
You couldn't break him?

374
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,360
I've beaten him within an inch of his life

375
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,520
for more than one time.

376
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,880
He just won't talk.

377
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,840
I'm afraid of killing him.

378
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
So, I've just detained him.

379
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,920
But he has a wife,

380
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,720
who's likely gone into hiding

381
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,480
after hearing rumors.

382
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
My men are searching for her.

383
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,560
Don't worry,

384
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,200
I'll find a way

385
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,360
to get those negatives.

386
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,600
The Meng case

387
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,600
wasn't dwelt on by Nakamura

388
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,840
because

389
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,960
our uniforms

390
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,560
still hold value.

391
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,960
Keep that in mind.

392
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,200
As for Hua Zhen,

393
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,120
stop meddling

394
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,480
in his affairs.

395
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,280
No more investigation?

396
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,160
Not even I

397
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,880
am not in the position to investigate him.

398
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,040
Think of him as Sun Wukong.

399
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,080
If you didn't have Buddha

400
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,920
to suppress him

401
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,560
under the Five Fingers Mountain,

402
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,720
stay out of his business.

403
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,600
Otherwise, it's you and me

404
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,040
who will end up worse off.

405
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,120
You'll understand

406
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,080
this later.

407
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,160
And,

408
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
that Captain

409
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
from the Fourth House,

410
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,640
what's his name again?

411
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Chen Hao.

412
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,400
Right, Chen Hao.

413
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,040
Lift his

414
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,080
suspension too.

415
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,840
Is he also Sun Wukong?

416
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,000
The Police Service of French Concession Municipal Council

417
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,560
sent a letter of thanks to headquarters,

418
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,680
thanking Chen Hao for assisting

419
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,920
in capturing the killer.

420
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,720
The Director

421
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,320
also wants to use this opportunity

422
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,880
to ease

423
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,600
relations with the foreigners.

424
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,400
From my position,

425
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,200
I also don't want to complicate things further.

426
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,560
Let it rest.

427
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,560
[Captain,]

428
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,120
[we're approaching Zhang Runjin's]

429
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,240
[hideout in Shanghai.]

430
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,800
[Our scouts]

431
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,640
[are already upstairs.]

432
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
Any findings?

433
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,080
Sorry, nothing yet.

434
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,360
Coming!

435
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:15,880
Hello,

436
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,200
is this Mr. Zhang Runjin's residence?

437
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,720
Yes, he just stepped out.

438
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,040
I have a letter for Mr. Zhang.

439
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,800
Just leave it here.

440
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,880
He'll pick it up soon.

441
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,360
Alright.

442
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,360
Thank you.

443
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,640
Renting a house in Guangzhou?

444
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,960
Guangzhou?

445
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Take a good look.

446
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,000
Look at this letter

447
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,600
to Zhang Runjin.

448
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,720
The landlord mentions

449
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,640
that Zhang rented a house

450
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,440
in Guangzhou a month ago

451
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,880
and paid a year's rent in advance,

452
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,040
but no one

453
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,400
has moved in yet.

454
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,200
Are you suggesting

455
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,040
this house might be connected to Hua Zhen?

456
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,320
Zhang Runjin wouldn't rent a house in Guangzhou

457
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,600
without good reason

458
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,480
after being away for so long.

459
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,960
Whether it's related to Hua Zhen,

460
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,200
I'm not sure.

461
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,520
But I'm certain

462
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,600
it's connected to something

463
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,040
the CPC is up to.

464
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,240
Come in!

465
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,640
Captain,

466
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,600
I've got the tickets to Guangzhou.

467
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,400
Excellent! Come on.

468
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,600
Let's head to Guangzhou.

469
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,080
Why didn't Mr. Zhang come himself?

470
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,280
He's tied up with business in Shanghai

471
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,480
and can't get away.

472
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,440
He asked me to handle this for him.

473
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,360
He paid me

474
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,080
a year's rent here.

475
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,560
Said it was for a friend.

476
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,640
But it's been a month

477
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,080
and no one has moved in yet.

478
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,040
Do you know

479
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,120
what's going on?

480
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,720
He didn't mention it.

481
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,680
Do you know

482
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,040
who he rented it for?

483
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,480
Not much.

484
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,880
It should be for a couple with a child

485
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,920
and a young man

486
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,520
in his twenties,

487
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,200
said to be relocating

488
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,560
to Guangzhou from out of town.

489
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,680
He is a distant relative of mine,

490
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
so of course, I trust him

491
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,360
and didn't ask further.

492
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,640
What's with the lock today?

493
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
There's no rush.

494
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,200
He told me

495
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,240
there were some items inside

496
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,520
he needed me to fetch for him.

497
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,280
There you go.

498
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,040
Come on in. This way.

499
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Please come in.

500
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,600
He hasn't moved in yet

501
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,480
and I haven't cleaned.

502
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Sorry for the dust.

503
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,440
I hope you don't mind.

504
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,240
He's got

505
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
quite a nice place here.

506
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,560
Indeed.

507
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,080
Honestly,

508
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,240
once I've received the rent,

509
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,560
it's not my place to meddle

510
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,480
when they choose to move in.

511
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,720
But I've had

512
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,360
a bit of trouble here recently.
