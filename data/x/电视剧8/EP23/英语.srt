[specifically from Nanjing.]

[We can't see the face of the man on the left.]

Gosh, man!

21
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,960
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,640
Oh,

23
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,800
Captain Chen?

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,640
I'm here to wash face and keep sober.

25
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,000
Look at me, all thumbs.

26
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,920
No worries.

27
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,760
Hand me some tissues.

28
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,360
Sure.

29
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Are you on duty here?

30
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
I got this

31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
[by accident while teaching]

32
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,280

Alright.

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,520
You go on.

36
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,880
Wipe yourself off too.

37
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
Why are you here?

38
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,800
On duty.

39
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,280
Tell the truth.

40
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
Wash face and keep sober.

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
Still playing dumb?

42
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
You don't need to stay here.

43
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Go back to the station.

44
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
You're back early this time.

45
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Hello, Captain Chen.

46
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,240
Hi.

47
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,880
[Hello,]

48
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,040
is this Ms. Shi?

49
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
This is Chen Hao from the church.

50
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,880
I accidentally took away

51
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
the teaching materials the other day.

52
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,560
[Would it be convenient for you]

53
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,680
[to pick them up now?]

54
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,440
What's going on?

55
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
The figure

56
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
in the photo is Hua Liang.

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,600
How do you know?

58
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,840
He's here in Shanghai.

59
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
I recognized him while he's

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
dining with Tan Shiyuan.

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,640
I've compared the photos

62
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,640
and confirmed it's him.

63
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,840
Okay,

64
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,360
I'll contact the Power Bureau.

65
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,840
We can't wait.

66
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,080
The banquet

67
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,120
is about to end.

68
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,880
He's with Tan Shiyuan

69
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,600
right now

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
and will soon find out

71
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,920
Mrs. Peng was taken in

72
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,960
by Xiang Yuansheng.

73
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
He will definitely take her away.

74
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,240
I need to intercept

75
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
them first.

76
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,840
Are you planning to go alone?

77
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,120
Yes.

78
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,280
[I'm the only one]

79
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,000
[with the credential.]

80
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,480
[I'm requesting to carry out this mission.]

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,120
What if you run into

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
Xiang Yuansheng?

83
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll handle it.

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
[Mr. Hua, please wait.]

85
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,320
Mr. Hua.

86
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,000
What is it?

87
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,480
The wife

88
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,320
of the reporter

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,720
is hiding in Jiangnan Shipyard.

90
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,400
For specifics,

91
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,280
you might

92
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,080
need to ask your brother.

93
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
Hua Zhen?

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Feng Guangyun saw him

96
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,320
driving her

97
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,760
into the Shipyard.

98
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,400
Feng's team

99
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,920
were stopped at the gate.

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,040
If

101
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,160
not convenient for you,

102
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
I'll have to notify the headquarters

103
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,000
to contact directly with the Security Dept.

104
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,680
Then,

105
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,480
the police will handle it.

106
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
For any issues with my brother.

107
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,520
I must handle myself.

108
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,440
Good,

109
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,400
I await your good news.

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
Heading to Jiangnan Shipyard.

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,800
Any credentials?

112
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,480
Go ahead.

113
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,560
Where's the Gastroenterology?

114
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,240
On the second floor.

115
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,880
Thank you.

116
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
You sneak in here like this,

117
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,840
still trying to

118
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,320
help Feng Guangyun?

119
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
It has nothing to do with him.

120
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm a friend of Peng,

121
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,560
entrusted to

122
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,960
take care of his family.

123
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,360
I've found

124
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
a safer place

125
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
for Mrs. Peng outside.

126
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm coming to move her out.

127
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I just brought

128
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
her here last night,

129
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,920
and this morning

130
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,480
the police came for an arrest.

131
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,560
What exactly is Feng trying to do?

132
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,560
I'm not very clear

133
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,720
about the affairs at the station.

134
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,800
Two months ago,

135
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,080
when she went to report,

136
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,280
you told Luo Minmin

137
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,600
not to get involved.

138
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,480
You knew

139
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,640
what was happening then,

140
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,120
right?

141
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Yes.

142
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,160
Does the disappearance

143
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,440
have something to do with Feng?

144
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,160
Is the closure of

145
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,560
the Fourth Station related to this?

146
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,760
I can't answer

147
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,080
these now.

148
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,960
Fine,

149
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
I can ask nothing.

150
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,120
But today,

151
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,400
outside the Shipyard,

152
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
I played along with you for half the day.

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,240
You at least

154
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,800
owe me an explanation

155
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
of why you're working under Feng.

156
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,000
You want her from me,

157
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,720
but not willing

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,240
to explain anything.

159
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,360
The Shipyard is already secure.

160
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,240
Why move?

161
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,640
What are you guarding against?

162
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,600
Me?

163
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,360
[I got this]

164
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,120
[by accident while teaching]

165
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,600
[Yuansheng how to drive.]

166
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,520
[You two are close.]

167
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
If you still trust me,

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,480
let her

169
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,400
come with me.

170
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,880
I can't explain everything now.

171
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,520
I used to

172
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,120
trust you unconditionally,

173
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
but I can't do that anymore.

174
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
If I catch you

175
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,760
here again,

176
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,080
no matter how,

177
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
I'll immediately notify the Security Dept.

178
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,600

355
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Could you direct me to the Internal Medicine?

356
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,080
I know the way.

357
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,160
Follow me.

358
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,680
Hurry.

359
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200
Lead the way.

360
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,440
You're complained

361
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,360
by policemen.

362
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,400
On my official business here,

363
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,040
I have to firstly

364
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,160
deal with your mess.

365
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,360
Wasn't the last investigation

366
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,200
enough to teach you a lesson?

367
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,920
Don't be

368
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,040
childish!

369
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,520
When in Jiangyin,

370
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,320
I asked you about

371
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,640
a missing reporter.

372
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,280
Do you remember?

373
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,680
Yes.

374
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,080
He

375
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,880
committed the crime of murder.

376
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,160
The woman you brought in

377
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,040
is his wife, and also the accomplice.

378
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,120
The police got information

379
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,320
and came here to arrest her.

380
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,800
But you ordered the guard

381
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,000
to stop them outside.

382
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,520
What's your problem?

383
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,760
You must transfer her

384
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,920
to the police immediately.

385
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,640
Don't make trouble,

386
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,920
or you will be disciplined.

387
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,600
Understand?

388
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,760
Come on.

389
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,000
Liang,

390
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,960
I heard yesterday this

391
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,720
Dermatology Dept. is well-known.

392
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,320
The scar on your wrist...

393
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,360
Alright.

394
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,080
If you care about me,

395
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,160
save me the trouble.

396
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,480
Where is she?

397
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,240
Has she not completed

398
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,360
her lung examination yet?

399
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,960
Are you asking me?

400
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,880
Where is the consulting room?

401
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
On the first floor.

402
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,680
[Has a patient]

403
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
from the Internal Medicine

404
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
been sent to my place?

405
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,040
During the noon break,

406
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,320
a pulmonologist

407
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,960
asked us

408
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,160
to send the patient here.

409
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,360
Who?

410
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,440
What's the name?

411
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,680
[I didn't ask for it.]

412
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,040
This man was there, too.

413
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,000
He saw me leading the patient

414
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,360
with the help of her company.

415
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
She had company?

416
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,160
Yes.

417
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,680
A young lady

418
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,600
came with her.

419
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
There's a doctor in the room.

420
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
I can't get in during the examination.

421
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,520
So I stopped at the door

422
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,440
and left.

423
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,120
[Mr. Zhao,]

424
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,600
[where is my overall?]

425
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,680
I hung it up here

426
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
after my meal.

427
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,240
I didn't pay attention to it.

428
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,160
Whose bag is it?

429
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,480
You need to

430
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,000
take medicine by advice.

431
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,400
Three times a day.

432
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,160
I will.

433
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,640
Mrs. Feng,

434
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,360
take good care

435
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,440
of yourself.

436
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,160
OK.

437
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,840
Thank you so much.

438
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,400
Are you okay to go home yourself?

439
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,600
Captain,

440
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,560
why did Xiang Yuansheng's brother

441
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,840
come for Mrs. Peng?

442
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
What happened between Yuansheng and you?

443
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,640
I can't explain now.

444
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
The Fourth Station was dissolved.

445
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,280
I feel sad

446
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,200
as I see you both

447
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,840
like this.

448
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,720
Go home, Minmin.

449
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,320
Is Xiang Yuansheng safe

450
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,560
there?

451
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
He will be OK.

452
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,040
Go back home.

453
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,480
I had asked Dr. Liu.

454
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,960
He didn't take the woman

455
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
for a lung examination.

456
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,120
The pulmonologist at noon is a fake.

457
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,360
[Should we]

458
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
[inform the Security Dept.]

459
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,440
[to block all exits?]

460
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,720
No need.

461
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,560
They should

462
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,040
have already left.

463
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,360
Wait here.

464
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,520
I walk him back to his dorm.

465
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,040
Do you

466
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,760
know Peng...

467
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Be quiet.

468
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,800
Go back first.

469
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,040
Is this your dorm?

470
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,680
Yes.

471
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,360
Hua Zhen,

472
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,440
give me some answers.

473
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,320
[How did you know]

474
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,480
[Mrs. Peng?]

475
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,680
Days ago, I went back

476
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,320
to the Fourth Station.

477
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,560
Unexpectedly,

478
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,960
it's dissolved.

479
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,040
I encountered her at the gate.

480
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,640
She begged me to help her

481
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,680
avoid being persecuted.

482
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,320
Then I brought her back.

483
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,760
What else did she tell you?

484
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,800
Nothing.

485
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,800
Did she mention her husband?

486
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,840
No.

487
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,960
The nurse said

488
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,200
she had company.

489
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
Who is that?

490
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,200
Someone beside her.

491
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,040
I don't know.

492
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,480
What did you wanna ask me?

493
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,320
Go ahead.

494
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,960
Do you know

495
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,040
why is Mr. Peng missing?

496
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,400
I've told you he's not missing,

497
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
but arrested for homicide.

498
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,840
[Hua Zhen,]

499
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,720
do you know

500
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,320
how the woman

501
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,080
left the hospital?

502
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm asking you.

503
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,080
No.

504
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,760
No matter what the truth

505
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,280
of the matter is,

506
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,120
it's none of our business.

507
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,840
Don't forget

508
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,560
what happened to Wei Daiqing.

509
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,720
What you say

510
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,600
is not only about yourself,

511
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,640
but about

512
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,360
the whole family.

513
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,160
You'll stay in Shanghai

514
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,280
for 7 days, right?

515
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,560
Just stay here.

516
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,720
Don't wander about.

517
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,800
Once the mission is done,

518
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,480
go back to Jiangyin immediately.

519
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,680
What else can I do for you?

520
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,480
No more.

521
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,880
Take care of yourself.

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,840
navigation science at the S.M.C.?

532
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,600
Yes. What's up?

533
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,560
Class 3 has a man

534
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,680
named Hua Zhen.

535
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,040
Did he come back to the dorm?

536
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,320
He is out.

537
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,320
Alone?

538
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,040
No.

539
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,240
With some classmates

540
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,160
by a ride.

541
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,520
Was he ever

542
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,600
in trouble?

543
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,320
Nobody dares to make trouble for him.

544
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,040
[Are you here for him?]

545
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
I just asked.

546
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Thank you.

547
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,880
That's all right.

548
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,240
[You are back.]

549
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,200
Dad.

550
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,040
Why are you

551
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,240
staying up so late?

552
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,400
Qinqin told me

553
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,280
you told her over the phone

554
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,360
that you stayed at a friend's house last night.

555
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,960
Yes.

556
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,920
An old friend came back.

557
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,240
You are a girl.

558
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,280
Don't stay the night outside.

559
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,720
OK, dad.

560
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,640
Don't wait for me so late.

561
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,400
You should go to bed early.

562
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,920
Go and sleep.

563
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,840
Luo Minmin.

564
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,800
Give the warmer back to me.

565
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,160
Stop it.

566
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Dad bought it for me.

567
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,120
Answer a few questions.

568
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,080
I'll give it to you.

569
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,080
Where were you last night?

570
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,640
And why did you come back late tonight?

571
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,080
Did the instructor

572
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,280
of the training camp

573
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,040
invite you again?

574
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,880
Xiang Yuansheng is back.

575
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,280
Have you been with him?

576
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,120
Do you ask him

577
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,480
why he didn't write to you?

578
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,720
No.

579
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,600
Do you tell him

580
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,720
you've been waiting?

581
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,600
No.

582
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,720
C'mon.

583
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,080
I know how you struggled

584
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
in the past 2 months.

585
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,800
You're tied up with

586
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,520
your work

587
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,160
to avoid

588
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,480
thinking about him.

589
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
You've been waiting for his letter

590
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:43,960
for 2 months.

591
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Why didn't you tell him?

592
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
He's here for a mission,

593
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,400
and will be back in a few days.

594
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,400
After all,

595
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,680
the past

596
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,320
is the past.

597
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,200
Can you put it down?

598
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,480
Give it back to me tomorrow.

599
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,400
You're not too bad yet.

600
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
[Go to bed now.]

601
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,920
Mr. Hua.

602
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
The Corp needs to know

603
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,440
how much the reporter found.

604
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,320
He once boarded a freighter.

605
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,760
But we found that

606
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,800
two days later.

607
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,000
From the photos we've got,

608
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,920
he had known

609
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,520
what were

610
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,560
in the containers.

611
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,400
Something else?

612
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,880
Hiding on the freighter,

613
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,080
he's probably

614
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,280
heard some details

615
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,640
about the deal.

616
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,240
But he hasn't said anything now.

617
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,880
Then

618
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,840
we're not sure what he knows.

619
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,640
He is only a reporter.

620
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,480
How did he spot the freighter?

621
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,480
[He's a member of the NSO.]

622
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,560
He investigated HBS in secret

623
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,640
in the name of doing news.

624
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,280
[He'd have followed me to the dock]

625
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,360
[and got aboard amidst the crowd.]

626
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,680
[Luckily,]

627
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,920
[the freight]

628
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,520
[has been unloaded.]

629

to arrive in Shanghai,

632
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,960
all will be shipped to Japan.

633
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,320
The NSO has close connections

634
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,800
with the Communist Party.

635
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,600
The Party

636
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,040
is definitely involved in this.

637
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,520
[The Army Ministry]

638

Neither does the Corp.

641
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,120
But the premise

642
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,600
is that QX JV Corp

643
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,880
can't be exposed.

644
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,680

You know

654
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,200
that what is loaded

655
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,960
in the containers

656
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,320

and depart for Japan,

661
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,840
I can resolve

such a change in between.

663
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,400
You mean,

664
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,720
we can rest assured.

665
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,160

You

got out of the hospital,

681

684

Mr. Nakamura and I had heard of it.

685

He's accused of a communist.

686

00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,480
[to suspect us.]

707
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,720
Tan just

708
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,520
expressed our concerns.

709
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,840
As long as the freight

710
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,640
can arrive on schedule,

711
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,200
how to deal with Hua Zhen

712
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,840
is a family affair.

713
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,240
Mr. Hua,

714
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,840
I have no intention

715
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,320
of offending.

716
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,000
Actually,

717
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,680
I kept the reporter alive

718
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,960
for the sake

719
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,120
of the film.

720
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,480
But so far,

721
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,960
he hasn't said anything.

722
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,600
I'll wait for

723
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,840
another week.

724
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,720
If no result

725
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,520
by then,

726
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,800
he will be killed.

727
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,080
How to handle a case

728
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,760
is the duty of the police.

729
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,080
But for my brother,

730
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,200
this is my own business.

731
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,800
I mean, myself.
