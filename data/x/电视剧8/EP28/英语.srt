3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
Isnâ€™t it coalball, Dongbao?

4
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,000
No, it isn't.

5
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,880
If I'm correct,

6
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,360
this is tungsten ore.

7
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
And these are bristles.

8
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,560
These are all materials

9
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,880
for weapons.

10
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,320
I've learned about it

11
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,080
when I took the police training course.

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,440
Munitions are military supplies

13
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,400
which can't be traded

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
as normal goods.

15
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,760
Is it smuggling?

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,240
Who will these munitions be

17
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,840
smuggle to?

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,360
Do you know

19
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,600
who rented the No.1 warehouse?

20
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
No.

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
Not even uncle Xu himself knows.

22
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,640
Well, you're not a police officer.

23
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
Dongbao.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,600
You can do nothing about it.

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,480
Pack it up for me.

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,720
What will you do?

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,200
I'll bring them to the Anti-smuggling Department,

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,320
of General Maritime Customs Service Administration

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,840
in Shanghai Customs District.

30
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Anti-smuggling Department?

31
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,360
It fights against smugglers.

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
If the goods are

33
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,600
suspicious,

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,680
they will follow up.

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,880
It's dark outside,

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,760
you should take care.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,000
Go back home as soon as possible.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,560
OK.

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,960
Stay at home and wait for me.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,160
Easy.

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,760
Be careful on the way.

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,160
Nakamura Naoki.

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,120
Have you finished tallying?

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,880
Not yet.

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,720
Why?

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
We lost one case.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,520
It seemed that someone broke in from the window.

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,040
The warehouse is not safe anymore.

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,320
Bring several trucks.

50
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,760
Move all of them to HBS.

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,120
Move to our place?

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,120
We can't find

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
a safer place now.

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,760
And the last batch of goods

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,680
will arrive here

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
from Wusong Port.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,360
These goods

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,400
need to be stored at HBS

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,560
for only 2 or 3 days.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
When the last batch of goods arrives,

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,360
we'll ship them to Japan.

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,960
Hurry up.

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,760
Yes, Sir.

64
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,160
Deputy.

65
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
I received it from section chief Gao from Anti-smuggling Dpt.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,120
of General Maritime Customs Service Administration

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,600
in Shanghai Customs District.

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,240
Are they Nakamura Naoki's goods?

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,960
Yes.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
Someone whistle-blew it

71
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
to the Anti-smuggling Dpt.,

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
carrying the case.

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
This is the register information.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
This Tian Dongbao

75
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
was a policeman from the Fourth Station.

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
After the Fourth Station was closed,

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,360
he becomes a dock worker.

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,520
In my opinion,

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,480
he happened to see the goods

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,120
in the warehouse

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
when he passed by.

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Have you checked the case?

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,280
Yes.

84
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
Nothing is missing.

85
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
And the customs police told him

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,520
to keep it confidential

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,320
He is an honest man

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,320
and easy to deal with.

89
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,960
A bedbug.

90
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,840
Solve the problem.

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,640
Deputy,

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
more more thing,

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,920
I've known the woman

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,880
who stayed with

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,760
the wife

96
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,160
of the reporter.

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,920
She must know

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
where the couple of the reporters are.

99
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,520
However,

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,520
she has a close relationship with Hua Zhen.

101
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I wonder whether

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I can arrest her or not.

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
Don't you remember what I've told you?

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,880
You can rely on me

105
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
and

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,840
my back is covered by

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
Nakamura Naoki.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm back.

109
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
Have you turned it in?

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,840
I did.

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,840
They said they would investigate it.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
If it has problems,

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
they'll solve them.

114
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
Warm yourself by the fire.

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,640
Dongbao,

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,920
could it bring any trouble

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
on us?

118
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,640
No.

119
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,640
The customs police said I did the right thing.

120
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,000
If the goods are smuggling articles,

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,280
the police will

122
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,160
be troubled.

123
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,240
They registered

124
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,960
my household information.

125
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,000
They will

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,480
put my name on the list of

127
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,080
good citizens.

128
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,760
They asked me to keep it confidential.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
If there were any leak of information,

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,640
the criminal could have escaped.

131
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,280
Don't tell anyone else.

132
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,000
I got it.

133
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,120
Well,

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,720
I've an appointment

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,120
with the team.

136
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,720
We'll set off

137
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,640
early in the morning.

138
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,760
I must go shortly.

139
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,000
I haven't packed up my lugage yet.

140
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,640
You stay and I'll pack up for you.

141
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,600
Dongbao,

142
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,240
how long will you be back this time?

143
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,000
2 or 3 days.

144
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
Could you please not go?

145
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,240
With one injured hand,

146
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
you can't do much.

147
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
Why not just have a rest at home?

148
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I don't need to haul bags this time,

149
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,720
They need someone who guards the goods

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,520
on the car in case of thieves

151
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,560
when sleeping

152
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
at night.

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
I just need to guard the goods.

154
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,760
You should get sleep, too.

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,920
Not necessarily.

156
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,160
Yu,

157
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,960
if I stayed at home,

158
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,440
Erbai and others would come to see me

159
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
and buy things for me.

160
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,560
It's not easy for them to make money.

161
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,280
So I want to earn more money

162
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,280
and return

163
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,920
their favor.

164
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,600
What's more,

165
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,880
I can earn money this time

166
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,200
for delivering goods.

167
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
I heard them say

168
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,520
the top-scholar cakes of Fengjing are delicious.

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,480
I'll bring some cakes back

170
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,320
to you

171
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,400
and Erbai then.

172
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
Alright.

173
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,560
You're a good person.

174
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
But I'm worrying about you.

175
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
Make sure you eat well.

176
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,240
I got you.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,720
Dongbao,

178
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,520
think over the baby's name

179
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,000
whenever you are free.

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,760
Once you name it,

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,640
I could talk to it

182
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,920
by its name.

183
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,520
OK.

184
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,280
I'll think hard.

185
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,720
I will come up with 3 options for you

186
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,280
before I come back.

187
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
OK.

188
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,600
Let me listen to

189
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,840
my son.

190
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,280
It maybe a baby girl.

191
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,560
That's good, too.

192
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,000
I like both.

193
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,440
Don't worry about me.

194
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Wait for me.

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Minmin.

196
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,160
Dad.

197
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,160
Minmin,

198
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
it's the eight-treasure rice pudding in it.

199
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
Your friend is pregnant,

200
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,080
so, I bring some more for her.

201
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Thank you, dad.

202
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,480
Hurry back.

203
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,720
Wait,

204
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,680
what would you like to eat as dinner?

205
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,760
I want to have some soup.

206
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,320
I want warm soup made by yellow croaker.

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,800
I got it.

208
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,960
I'll cook it for you.

209
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
I'll go back home soon.

210
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,520
OK.

211
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Did Dongbao tell you

212
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,000
when he would go back home?

213
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,880
He said it just needs 2 or 3 days.

214
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,960
Maybe he will come back tomorrow.

215
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,720
Dongbao said that

216
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,000
he'd bring tasty food back from Jinshanwei.

217
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,120
Minmin,

218
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,760
the rice pudding is so delicious.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,800
It's sweet.

220
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,760
It's my dad's cook.

221
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
You have a good appetite.

222
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,440
I don't know why.

223
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,000
Others vomit a alot when they are pregnant.

224
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,080
But I'm different.

225
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm full of vigor.

226
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,160
That's very good sign.

227
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
You have a good appetite and the baby feels happy.

228
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,240
Have you given a name?

229
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,280
Not yet.

230
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,320
Dongbao said that

231
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
he would think about it on his way.

232
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,520
And he made sure that he could offer me 3 names.

233
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,360
You must be very happy.

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,760
Get out of the car.

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,360
Go back home.

236
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,920
It's cold outside.

237
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,760
It doesn't matter.

238
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
I'll go with you till the end of the alley.

239
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
I should have some exercise.

240
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,520
OK, you should.

241
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,520
Brother Lu,

242
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,200
you've come back from Jinshanwei.

243
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,040
Where's Dongbao?

244
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
We didn't go to Jinshanwei.

245
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
Didn't Dongbao tell you?

246
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,080
He didn't go back home at all.

247
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,280
Really?

248
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Then where did he go?

249
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,080
Didn't he go with you

250
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,440
to haul goods in Jinshanwei?

251
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,400
Don't mention it.

252
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
When we gathered that night,

253
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,800
the boss said the business was canceled.

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,040
So, we went back home

255
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,560
after that.

256
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,840
Maybe

257
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,320
Dongbao had another work

258
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,240
to do.

259
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,160
No.

260
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,960
Lu.

261
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,680
Catch up

262
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm coming.

263
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
I have something to do.

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,480
Yu,

265
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,520
Keep asking the others.

266
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,400
I gotta go.

267
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,720
No.

268
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,840
He neither hauled goods nor went home.

269
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
Where could he be?

270
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
Yu, don't worry.

271
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,600
Will it possible for Dongbao

272
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
to go to another team?

273
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,200
Minmin, his hand was injured

274
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,480
and I'm pregnant now.

275
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,640
He wouldn't go anywhere

276
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,760
without telling me.

277
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,680
And he left

278
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,560
in the middle of night.

279
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,760
Where would he go?

280
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,320
Did he have some trouble

281
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,800
or met someone

282
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
before he left home?

283
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
Let's talk in the room.

284
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,800
Take care.

285
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,000
Minmin,

286
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,680
Dongbao had found some smuggling goods

287
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,440
in the warehouse that night.

288
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,160
He said it related to the military supplies.

289
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,160
And he reported to the Shanghai Customs District immediately.

290
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,120
Well,

291
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
did it bring some trouble

292
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,840
to him?

293
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,400
What's that?

294
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,560
It was a case,

295
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,320
in which Dongbao said there were bristles,

296
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,080
and some

297
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,520
tungsten things.

298
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,640
tungsten ore.

299
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,520
Yes, it is.

300
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,720
Where did you find the case?

301
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,520
The No.1 warehouse in Shiliupu Wharf.

302
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,400
It's near the warehouse

303
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,520
I'm working.

304
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,200
OK.

305
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Wait for me here.

306
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,160
I'll go for the captain.

307
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
I'll go with you.

308
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
I can tell the captain

309
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
what happened that night.

310
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,920
OK, let's go.

311
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
Take it easy.

312
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,960
No matter what happened,

313
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
if the captain is informed,

314
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
he'll help us.

315
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,160
What's the matter?

316
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,720
She is called Yu.

317
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,280
Yu?

318
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Do you know her?

319
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,520
She is over there.

320
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,160
The lady over there.

321
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,600
Listen, go straight and don't look back.

322
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,520
Qiang,

323
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,080
Li,

324
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,240
she is there.

325
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,920
Run.

326
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,080
Get her.

327
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Hurry.

328
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,800
Go.

329
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,400
Climb over..

330
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,480
What about you?

331
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't worry about me.

332
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,920
Run away.

333
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,040
Stop.

334
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,040
Run, Yu, don't worry.

335
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,960
You two, go.

336
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,160
Go ahead.

337
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
Chang, she ran away.

338
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,600
Catch her.

339
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Had Mr. Hua told you

340
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,240
how long we would stay here?

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,720
It won't be so long.

342
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,800
He'll attend meetings

343
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,040
next week in Nanjing.

344
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
Are you the head of the freight transport company?

345
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,680
Yes.

346
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm responsible to this freight.

347
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,040
My last name is Zhong.

348
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,480
How are the goods?

349
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
It's almost ready.

350
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
It needs 10 more minutes.

351
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,000
[OK, hurry up.]

352
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,160
[Don't delay the schedule.]

353
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:38,960
[OK.]

354
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
[Don't worry.]

355
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,200
[I'll give it you in the car.]

356
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
[This is the traffic permit that exempts you from inspection.]

357
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,440
[Tell the driver it is tea on the car.]

358
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
[Answer the same if the customs police ask.]

359

[Anti-smuggling Dpt. Of General Maritime Customs Service Administration]

360
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,640
[in Shanghai Customs District.]

361
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,320
Public Security Bureau in Shanghai.

362
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,640
With the 2 seals,

363
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,600
no one would inspect us

364
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,640
when passing the customs?

365
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,280
Yes.

366
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,880
They'll let you pass

367
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
having seen the seals.

368
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
Take this pass,

369
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,720
and I'll keep

370
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,760
this list of cargo.

371
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,040
OK.

372
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Sir,

373
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,400
where is the cargo going?

374
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,880
Japanese HBS.

375
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,360
It must be delivered before 2:00 p.m.

376
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,680
After arriving,

377
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,640
hand over your pass

378
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,560
and my cargo list together to

379
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,720
Mr. Feng of Criminal Investigation Dept.

at Shiliupu Police Station.

381
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,760
Don't lose it.

382
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,720
There is a layer of tea

383
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,840
covering the real goods,

384
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,800
and the real goods are beneath the tea.

385
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,520
[I suppose they want to]

386
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,400
[sell these goods to Japan]

387
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,640
[in the guise of tea.]

388
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,320
Officer Luo,

389
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,640
nice to meet you again.

390
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,160
Let's be frank.

391
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,240
You were the one who pretended to be Peng's wife

392
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,320
bu the side of Hua Zhen that day,

393
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,600
weren't you?

394
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,240
Where's the journalist and his wife?

395
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,600
I don't know.

396
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,200
These two are murderers.

397
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,720
You've been with them

398
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,760
since the dockyard hospital.

399
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,720
You don't know?

400
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,840
I don't.

401
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
You visited Tian Dongbao's wife.

402
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,040
What did she tell you?

403
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,760
We talked about cooking.

404
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Does it interest you?

405
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,760
[All checked,]

406
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,760
[no problem.]

407
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,720
[Then according to the old rules,]

408
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,560
[settle all payments]

409
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,040
[after cargo's safe arrival.]

410
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,240
[We'll rely on the escort]

411
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,680
[of Deputy Director Tan]

412
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,720
[on the way to the down town.]

413
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,520
[Don't worry.]

414
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,480
[My men]

415
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
[have told the van fleet.]

416
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,560
[There was a little disturbance]

417
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,640
[in the warehouse]

418
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
[two days ago.]

419
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,720
[Deputy Director Tan has solved it.]

420
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,960
[But I]

421
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
[am still a little worried.]

422
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,880
This is the last batch of cargo today,

423
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
and when it arrives in the down town,

424
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
my vessel should be there, too.

425
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,160
I hope we can leave

426
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,680
as soon as possible after loading,

427
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
so as to avoid any more uncertainties,

428
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,920
OK.

429
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,920
Well,

430
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,800
I'll coordinate with Shanghai Customs District,

431
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,360
Although there was

432
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,560
something unpleasant midway this time,

433
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,880
the cargo fortunately wasn't affected.

434
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,520
Mr. Hua,

435
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,480
I hope our following business

436
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,760
won't be affected neither.

437
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,920
[The Ministry of the Army]

438
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,120
[would also like to]

439
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
discuss a new order with you

440
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,120
for additional tungsten ore

441
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,280
and tung oil.

442
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,040
Do you have interest,

443
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,960
Mr. Hua?

444
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,440
As long as my company shows willing,

445
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm OK.

446
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,920
[But all deals]

447
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,400
[should be presented]

448
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,960
[to the company's shareholders.]

449
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,440
[I believe that]

450
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
[as long as the price is profitable,]

451
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
[we are willing to cooperate in good faith,]

452
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,280
[and collective prosperity.]

453
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,400
You are so frank,

454
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Mr. Hua.

455
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,120
Wish us a happy cooperation.

456
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,040
Thank you for your hard work.

457
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,640
[Welcome back.]

458
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,480
[Bro.]

459
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,520
[Is everything OK?]

460
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,800
[Why the posture?]

461
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,880
[Are you a guest?]

462
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
[You really have fun in Shanghai, don't you?]

463
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,640
[You played yourself into jail.]

464
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,040
[Everything will be worked out.]

465
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,600
[I know.]

466
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,880
[You can choose to stay out of politics]

467
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,760
[but you have to stay sensitive]

468
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,680
[and cautious.]

469
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,040
[You are the son of the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Military Affairs]

470
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,680
[So, don't say]

471
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,960
[these words again]

472
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,800
[even at home.]

473
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,760
[As long as the price is profitable,]

474
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,400
[we are willing to cooperate in good faith,]

475
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,400
[and collective prosperity.]

476
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,440
Feng Sir,

477
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,160
you should have known

478
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,200
the relationship between

479
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Luo Minmin and Hua Zhen.

480
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,360
Do you think

481
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,720
we should report this

482
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,640
to Deputy Director Tan?

483
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,040
He is working at Wusong Port,

484
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,640
and I will call him later.

485
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,680
Well,

486
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,120
are we really going to do this?

487
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,200
As Deputy Director Tan said before,

488
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,360
I can follow my ideas.

489
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,320
If you decide to tell me,

490
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,760
ring the bell.

491
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,680
Ring the Bell,

492
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,760
and you can live,

493
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,360
or,

494
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,160
you will freeze to death here

495
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
and be a Jane Doe at best.

496
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,600
This place is cold,

497
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,400
just

498
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,880
to help you

499
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,680
cool down.

500
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,360
Close the door.

501
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,520
[Wake up.]

502
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,960
[We've noticed you for a long time.]

503
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,680
[You don't work for]

504
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,880
[our freight company.]

505
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
[Who are you?]

506
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,560
[I saw you]

507
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,200
[rummaging in the van just now,]

508
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,160
[and sneaking in it]

509
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,680
[for a long time.]

510
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
[Are you trying to get in there]

511
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,400
[and steal something?]

512
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,280
[If you don't speak, I'll call the police.]

513
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,960
[You don't need to call the police.]

514
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,520
[The youngest one]

515
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,680
[of your three bosses is my brother.]

516
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,840
[I'm here for him.]

517
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,200
[Please ask him to come over,]

518
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,760
[and he'll thank you.]

519
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,560
What's your brother's name?

520
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,400
Goodbye.

521
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,520
That's all for now.

522
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,640
What's up?

523
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,640
Is the gentleman in Chinese tunic suit

524
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,800
Mr. Hua?

525
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,920
What's up?

526
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Someone wants to meet him.

527
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,000
Mr. Hua, someone wants to meet you.

528
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,040
Boss, we just caught a man,

529
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,120
and thought he was a thief,

530
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,640
but he said he is your brother,

531
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,280
and asked us

532
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,440
to take you to meet with him alone.

533
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,240
He said he is Hua Zhen.

534
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,160
Where is he?

535
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,720
We brought him to the office.

536
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,920
Boss, is he your brother?

537
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,920
I promised them

538
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,240
you'd thank them as long as

539
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,320
they don't hand me over to the police.

540
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,760
Give them money.

541
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,720
My life is worth so little?

542
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,360
Thank you, boss.

543
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,480
Take them away.

544
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,880
Wait,

545
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,240
this has nothing to do with them,

546
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,680
so let them go.

547
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,120
Just go.

548
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Let's go.

549
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,760
You get out, too.

550
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,440
What are you doing here?

551
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,080
And you?

552
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,680
What are you doing here?

553
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,240
How much money do you earn

554
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,200
from this business today?

555
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,320
What did Peng Ganwen's wife

556
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,200
say to you?

557
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
It's not Mrs. Peng.

558
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,600
Then who is it?

559
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,640
Didn't Tan Shiyuan tell you

560
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,440
that Journalist Peng

561
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,640
has been rescued by me?

562
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,680
And now I know

563
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,560
why you kidnapped

564
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,960
Journalist Peng.

565
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,520
I am a soldier

566
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
and I will be the first to go to the frontline

567
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,200
if China and Japan go to War.

568
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,960
I can't believe my brother

569
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,080
would smuggle military supplies to Japanese

570
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,040
and allow them to

571
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,480
turn the smuggled tungsten ore

572
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,120
and tung oil into shells

573
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,680
and drop them on my head.

574
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,720
So I have to see in person.

575
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,960
I'm convinced now.

576
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,240
Hua Zhen,

577
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,320
maybe you think

578
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,560
all people and things

579
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,840
are either good or bad,

580
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,840
right or wrong,

581
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,440
black or white,

582
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,240
but I tell you,

583
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,800
most of the time,

584
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,720
it's just the two good man of us

585
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,760
working in

586
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,960
different positions.

587
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,920
What's your

588
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,720
different position?

589
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,520
My position is

590
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,520
always the Hua family.

591
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,280
So all our families

592
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,440
know this?

593
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,600
Mom doesn't know.

594
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,040
Dad was also a soldier.

595
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,680
He fought in the Northern Expedition with the former premier,

596
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,760
and he knew how difficult it was

597
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,040
for China to achieve unification.

598
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,600
Did those hardships end up

599
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
being for the sake of today's business?

600
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,840
The great adventure

601
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,040
had been accomplished,

602
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,320
and everyone wants to

603
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,240
take some profits from it.

604
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:17,960
What's wrong with that?

605
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,040
Why can't we?

606
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,440
You don't understand this,

607
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,680
but it doesn't mean it's wrong.

608
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,320
It's just

609
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,800
you can't understand.

610
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Don't think what you see

611
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,440
and what you hear is the truth,

612
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,360
and don't use it to judge me.

613
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,800
What is the truth?

614
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,480
Is there a second option

615
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,040
when we face the possible fall of the nation?

616
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,240
And if we even need to

617
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,200
talk about positions on this matter,

618
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
talk about right and wrong,

619
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,600
we are fundamentally different.

620
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,840
I'm your brother.

621
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,600
We just have different ideas.

622
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,840
Don't regard me

623
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,080
as your enemy so easily.

624
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,240
This is not a concept, but a bottom line.

625
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,080
"Internal disunity dissolves at the threat of external invasion."

626
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,320
Communists have been pressed

627
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,600
by you to the end,

628
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,960
but still spare no efforts

629
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,040
to resist against Japanese.

630
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,360
While the pillars of our party and state

631
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,680
smuggle military supplies

632
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,800
to the Japanese.

633
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,800
"Cooperate in good faith, and collective prosperity."

634
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,040
How am I suppsed to understand you?

635
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,320
Do you want to be a traitor

636
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,240
and a flunky of the Japanese?

637
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
What are you saying?

638
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,880
Don't think I won't beat you

639
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,840
as you learned something

640
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,200
in military school.

641
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,600
You go back to school by my car now.

642
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,840
Mom told me before my departure,

643
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,480
that no matter what happens,

644
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,960
I have to protect you.

645
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,760
You can go back to school

646
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,800
unscathed now,

647
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,240
because I still remember

648
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,600
you are my brother.

649
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,200
Since I was little,

650
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,720
I've always been knowing

651
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,040
what I was missing.

652
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,920
I don't have companionship from parents,

653
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,920
and I don't have a family

654
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,320
have dinner at table, and talk.

655
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,040
But I have an elder brother.

656
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,680
When I got stuck in the car,

657
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,280
he would pull the door down

658
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,080
to get me out.

659
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,600
And when no one

660
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,200
would let me join the navy,

661
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,400
he would strive for my dream

662
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,720
against everyone.

663
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,720
When I reported to School of Mining Command,

664
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,840
he drove me to school

665
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,200
for straight two days and nights,

666
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,600
and took photos with me at the school gate.

667
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,680
You are the only person

668
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
I trust and depend on in this family.

669
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,120
Bro,

670
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,600
why you?

671
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,240
I don't live

672
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,480
in a utopia,

673
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,840
and I know someone

674
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,480
might have been doing this,

675
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,960
but why you?

676
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,040
You and me

677
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,480
are totally different.

678
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,080
I know we are different,

679
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,440
and I never think of

680
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,800
being a person like you.

681
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,120
But this never affects

682
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,600
your image in my heart.

683
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,600
I can take a bullet for you,

684
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,320
but what you saw today

685
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,600
won't change.

686
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,320
It won't change today,

687
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,040
and neither in the future.

688
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,840
Hua Zhen,

689
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,920
you are in danger now.

690
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,080
Go back to school.

691
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,200
Just go.

692
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,200
Go.

693
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,600
I didn't want to tell you

694
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,960
that Luo Minmin was arrested.

695
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,840
What?

696
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,800
If you go back to school now,

697
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,480
I will call them

698
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,600
and ask them

699
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,920
to keep her alive.

700
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,080
If you continue to waste time here,

701
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,080
she probably won't survive tonight.

702
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
What's wrong with Luo Minmin?

703
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,800
You take my car back to school now.

704
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,200
I have something to do here.

705
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,200
As long as my men tell me

706
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
that they see you entering the school,

707
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,760
I'll immediately call them

708
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,560
to let her go.

709
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,840
What happened to Luo Minmin?

710
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,040
Where is she?

711
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,520
Answer me!

712
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,800
You stay a minute longer,

713
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,720
and she'll die a minute sooner.

714
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,320
Is it Tan Shiyuan or Nakamura Naoki?

715
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,240
Or you?

716
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,120
What happened to Luo Minmin?

717
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,080
You're wasting her time.

718
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,840
Made up your mind?

719
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,320
Is she alive?

720
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Alive for now.

721
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,160
You promise me.

722
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,440
I promise,

723
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,080
as long as you go back to school,

724
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,400
I'll ask them to let her go.

725
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Send him back to school

726
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,680
and tell Master Hu

727
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,840
not to allow him to step out of the school

728
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,520
without my order.

729
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,520
Yes,sir.

730
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,840
And,

731
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,600
never repeat

732
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,040
what you said.
