Feng Sir

What are you doing here

6
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,160
so early?

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm coming for you.

What were you doing yesterday?

15
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
I was training new officers at the Fourth House.

16
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,560
Training?

20
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,320

Are you okay?

22
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes, I'm ok.

Two months ago,

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,840
there was a similar case,

49
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,520
in which the victim had his throat cut, too.

50

In every respect,

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,400
it is highly similar to the previous one

52
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
in Wenhua Hotel.

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,080
was executed.

But now you have the chance

178
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,480
and you want to quit.

179
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,840
This case is no longer

180
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
the concern of the Fourth House.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
It's not just me.

182
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,240
You'd be better to stay out of it.

183
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
You posted the notice, didn't you?

184
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,600
You want to investigate it

185
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,560
by yourself?

186
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,360
[I won't approve it!]

187
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,600
I've made up my mind.

188
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,600
Don't forget

189
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,040
you're still in your internship.

190
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,880
If you quit,

191
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,360
Luo Minmin will lose her partner.

192
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,240
What will she do?

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,920
Find a new partner for her.

194
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,840
I don't have any extra officers

195
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,800
for her.

196
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,360
Can't she finish the test on her own?

197
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,600
It's the rule of the police station,

198
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
not you or me.

199
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,440
She's your partner.

200
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,000
You should be responsible

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
for her!

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,120
I've never

203
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,040
treated anyone as my partner.

204
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,600
[You guys...]

205
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,880
Xiang Yuansheng wants to change a partner.

206
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,840
What're you doing?

207
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,360
Luo Minmin.

208
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,720
Yes, Sir!

209
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Why

210
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,600
the long face?

211
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you feel wronged?

212
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,120
No, Sir!

213
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,400
Remember,

214
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,760
don't take it too seriously,

215
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,480
understand?

216
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,880
Yes, Sir.

217
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,840
Go about your business.

218
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,240
Yes, sir.

219
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,240
[Now.]

220
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,240
Think it through.

221
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,000
If you decide to quit,

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm not going to ask

223
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,880
anything of you.

224
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,000
Once your internship is over,

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,120
you'll get a notice of dismissal.

226
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Tomorrow,

227
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,480
whether you go or not,

228
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,600
I will go there.

229
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,200
Today

230
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,360
I went to

231
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Shiliupu Police Station.

232
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,680
And I found out that

233
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,600
the case

234
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
is closed.

235
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Closed?

236
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,120
Who's the murderer?

237
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,520
A hobo.

238
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,600
He owed money, killed and fled,

239
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
then committed suicide after he was arrested.

240
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,040
They won't investigate

241
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,000
this case anymore.

242
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,840
Do you really think

243
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,240
they've found the murderer?

244
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,080
Captain,

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,640
you asked me

246
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,520
why I have been so stick

247
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,480
to this case.

248
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,360
I want to ask you the same question.

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,720
Why?

250
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Because I'm a policeman.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

252
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,240
The station house is just a small hole.

253
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,520
The policemen here

254
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,720
are also ordinary.

255
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,160
They don't have the capacity

256
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,360
to investigate this case.

257
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,840
The Fourth House shouldn't get into this trouble,

258
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,360
and neither should you.

259
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,600
If we work

260
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,880
a little harder,

261
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,120
we might catch the murderer.

262
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,360
What you should consider more is

263
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,400
the Fourth House are incapable

264
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,360
of catching the killer.

265
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,680
And it might even

266
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,600
get another penalty

267
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
for this.

268
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,000
It's meaningless.

269
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,520
Is it worth it?

270
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,120
It may mean nothing to you.

271
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,800
But just as

272
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,480
doctors do not choose their patients,

273
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,360
soldiers do not choose the battlefield.

274
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,840
In my opinion,

275
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,080
the same goes for the policemen.

276
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
If you didn't like it,

277
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
why did you become a policeman?

278
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
I'm not like you.

279
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
I used up all my luck

280
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,480
to get to here.

281
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
And I like it more and more.

282
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,400
Maybe you think the house is

283
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,480
ordinary or incapable.

284
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
But I will never leave it

285
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,880
unless

286
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,600
it is closed one day.

287
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,280
I respect your choice,

288
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,560
but I have my own choice.

289
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,520
If you really think

290
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,920
the Fourth House can't achieve justice,

291
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,120
you should stay.

292
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,400
It's not us who need you,

293
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,600
but the

294
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
victims who truly need justice.

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,760
Dad,

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,960
why are you here?

297
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,760
I've grown up.

298
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,520
And I can go home

299
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,360
by myself.

300
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,040
Officer Xiang.

301
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,280
Mr. Luo.

302
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,400
Yuansheng, my father...

303
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,640
Mr. Xiang,

304
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,920
I want to ask you something.

305
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,760
Are you sure you Second House

306
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
won't be penalized?

307
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,640
Dad, it's the Fourth House!

308
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
The Fourth House.

309
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,400
It'll be fine.

310
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,760
My dad wants to invite you to dinner.

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,400
Later,

312
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,880
come to my house

313
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
with your sister.

314
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,640
I have something to tell you.

315
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,920
And

316
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,960
my father bought a fish

317
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,760
in the market

318
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,360
to cook you braised fish.

319
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,880
Remember to bring Qiushi with you.

320
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,400
[Luo Qinqin,]

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,040
[How can you]

322
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,000
[talk to a boy alone!]

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,040
[Tell her to bring her homework.]

324
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,640
[I promised to tutor her.]

325
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,520
[I'll tell dad later.]

326
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,120
[We're all waiting for you at home!]

327
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,280
[Waiting for you!]

328
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,040
[You bad girl.]

329
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
Someone wants to invite you to dinner,

330
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,160
Officer Xiang?

331
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,760
How did you find here?

332
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,320
It's easy for me to know

333
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,360
a station house.

334
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,640
Do they know who you are?

335
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,400
Son of the Undersecretary of Ministry of Military Affairs

336
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,840
works as a recruit in such a

337
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,640
small station.

338
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,160
You can't even use your real name.

339
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,880
And now you're going to a policewoman's house

340
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,120
for braised fish.

341
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,040
Are you in love

342
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
with that girl?

343
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,400
What're you talking about.

344
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,880
Well, if it's not,

345
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,360
then tell me

346
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,800
what you are on.

347
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,400
Give me half a month,

348
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,120
after that,

349
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,120
I'll tell you everything.

350
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,520
I heard that

351
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
some time ago,

352
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,880
a man from Navy Department

353
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,120
was arrested on your father's

354
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,920
birthday party

355
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,120
for collaborating with the Communist Party.

356
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
Just tell me the truth.

357
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
What you're doing now

358
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,040
has anything to do with Deng?

359
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,680
Why do you ask?

360
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,840
Someone has asked me

361
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,680
about it.

362
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,880
Tell me the truth.

363
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,240
Do you have anything to do with him?

364
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,880
It's my choice to become a policeman.

365
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,040
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

366
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,640
Fine.

367
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,280
I'll take it as if

368
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,040
you've been in military school

369
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,400
for a long time,

370
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,280
and now come out to experience life.

371
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,640
But be careful

372
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,040
not to get yourself into trouble.

373
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,400
I've gotta go.

374
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,760
Don't forget you owe me an explanation.

375
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,240
Go to

376
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,400
eat your braised fish.

377
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,720
[Steamed meat buns!]

378
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
[Fried fish!]

379
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,560
Make way for me.

380
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,600
I'm coming.

381
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,680
It's my favorite

382
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,000
braised fish!

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,480
You like the braised fish?

384
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,040
Then bring your brother here more often.

385
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,680
Okay!

386
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,520
Uncle Luo,

387
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,040
Can I eat it now?

388
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,920
Of course!

389
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,600
Let's eat.

390
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,680
Thank you uncle Luo.

391
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,120
[Brother,]

392
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,840
[I don't expect anyone]

393
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,000
[to like your cooking.]

394
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,480
[You should have more faith on me]

395
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,760
[Thanks.]

396
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,560
[Are you OK with eating spicy food?]

397
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,560
[I'm OK.]

398
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,520
[Have a taste.]

399
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,080
[Do you like it?]

400
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,960
[Yes, I do.]

401
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,800
[Is it delicious?]

402
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,040
[Very much.]

403
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,960
[It's delicious, huh?]

404
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,520
[Eat more if you like it.]

405
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,040
[OK.]

406
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Looks like

407
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,680
I can't object to my daughter

408
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,960
being a policewoman.

409
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
I invited you to dinner today

410
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,680
to ask you a favor.

411
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,320
She's that kind of girl.

412
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,320
Even if you gave her the exam answers,

413
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,240
she would get them wrong.

414
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,080
Speaking of her,

415
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,520
her brain is average.

416
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
And she looks average.

417
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,840
When she walks in the street,

418
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,520
no one will notice her.

419
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,320
But now she's become a police officer.

420
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,960
I don't expect her to get credit.

421
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,120
I just want her to come home safely every day.

422
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm telling you this today

423
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,320
to ask you a favor.

424
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,040
Since you are partners,

425
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,400
please take care of her.

426
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,080
Mr. Luo,

427
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,520
I am sorry.

428
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,960
I can't help you with that.

429
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,680
I'm not a policeman anymore.

430
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,320
You quit?

431
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,840
Yes.

432
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,000
Are you saying

433
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,120
that my daughter has no partner

434
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,760
at the Fourth Station House?

435
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
This is a test I prepared for my students

436
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,240
when I was a tutor.

437
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,760
After you finish it,

438
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,320
I'll know exactly

439
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,680
where to start tutoring you.

440
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,480
Treat it

441
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,160
like a real test in school.

442
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,440
You need to write your name.

443
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,080
I'll score you. OK?

444
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
OK.

445
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,680
Let's begin.

446
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,920
Li.

447
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,680
[Coming.]

448
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,200
Tianxiang, may I help you?

449
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,720
Do you have time?

450
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
I want you

451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,360
to send two of my friends home.

452
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,360
Who can refuse when business comes knocking?

453
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,720
Allow me to wear my straw cape.

454
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,680
Wait a second.

455
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
Thank you.

456
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,440
No worries.

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,600
[Careful.]

458
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,560
[I'll help you with the umbrella.]

459
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,120
Learn hard from your brother.

460
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,960
My dad always

461
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,080
talks nonsense.

462
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,000
Don't pay any attention to him.

463
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,720
Officer Luo,

464
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,000
it was an accident that I joined the force.

465
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,080
It was also an accident that

466
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,920
I came to Shanghai.

467
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,640
Someone asked me to deliver something

468
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,520
to his friend in Shanghai.

469
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,320
I was supposed to leave

470
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,680
after the gift was delivered.

471
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,760
I have my own thing to do.

472
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,960
It's not in Shanghai.

473
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
And it's not in this station house.

474
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,960
I never thought

475
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,040
I would be expected of anything

476
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,000
as a policeman.

477
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
So,

478
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,960
you're saying that we're not partners.

479
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,680
For me,

480
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,120
a partner is someone

481
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,160
who goes the same way as mine.

482
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,360
I knew

483
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,680
I would leave the station house someday.

484
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,360
If we don't walk

485
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
on the same way,

486
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,080
how can we be partners?

487
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,520
Captain Chen is right.

488
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,440
You're doing great at the station house.

489
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,440
You can be a good policewoman.

490
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,440
You have a better chance

491
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,640
than I do.

492
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,120
Sister,

493
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,000
I read the homework

494
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,760
Yuansheng gave Qiushi.

495
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,320
I can tell

496
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,840
that he studied well.

497
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Maybe

498
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,920
he went to college before.

499
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
He was ten points below me

500
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,680
in the entrance examination.

501
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,320
You know nothing

502
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,600
about him.

503
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,160
Did you see his watch?

504
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,600
He's smart, rich,

505
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,240
and he looks like Clark·Gable.

506
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,520
He's not from the same world

507
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,960
as the policemen

508
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,320
in the Fourth Station House.

509
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,840
Yuansheng's sister

510
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
is awesome, too.

511
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Are you talking about Qiushi?

512
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,400
Check this out.

513
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,640
She got all the questions

514
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
I gave her right.

515
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,080
She didn't get a single question wrong.

516
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,240
Unbelievable.

517
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,760
She will definitely

518
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
go to college someday.

519
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,960
Look at the name.

520
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Why did she alter it?

521
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,440
She must have written it wrong.

522
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Even I couldn't write my name wrong.

523
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,440
What's the fussy about?

524
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,120
Meng Duo...

525
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,120
What's wrong?

526
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,360
[Mr. and Mrs. Meng, famous businessmen]

527
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,960
[in Shanghai, were killed.]

528
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
[They had a daughter.]

529
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,120
[She is Meng Duoci, eight years old.]

530
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,520
[She is suspected of missing or killed.]

531
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,680
[Doesn't your mom braid your hair]

532
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,920
[when you are at home?]

533
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,920
[My parents are not]

534
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
in Shanghai.

535
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,000
Then she won't

536
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,400
see her parents

537
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,640
for a long time.

538
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,760
Yes.

539
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,120
[Sister,]

540
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,320
[Qiushi said that]

541
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
[Yuansheng had been taking care of her.]

542
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,200
[She couldn't go to school]

543
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,840
[for some reason.]

544
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,520
[Yuansheng has been]

545
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,680
[teaching her.]

546
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,880
She said her parents were not in Shanghai.

547
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,680
Yeah.

548
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,400
No one knows

549
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,360
where they are.

550
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,160
If there was such an older brother

551
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,920
taking good care of me,

552
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,880
I would be happy, too.

553
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,760
Don't you think it's strange for him

554
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,000
to go to your station house

555
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
as a police officer?

556
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,640
He's smart and rich,

557
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,000
and he looks like a movie star.

558
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,480
What you should be thinking about is that

559
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
the Fourth Station House doesn't have

560
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,440
the ability to catch the murderer.

561
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,800
It might receive

562
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,680
another penalty

563
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,840
for this.

564
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,920
There is no point in doing so.

565
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,680
Is it worth doing?

566
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,480
He's keeping Qiushi with him.

567
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,280
He came to the Fourth Station House

568
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,600
to look into this case.

569
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,640
He dares to do

570
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,400
even what others fear the most.

571
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,680
How could he say that it was not worth it?

572
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,600
[Sister,]

573
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,000
[What are you talking about?]

574
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,640
[Are you listening to me?]

575
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,680
[Dad.]

576
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,360
[Why is there]

577
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,840
[a cake in the kitchen?]

578
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
Silly me,

579
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,240
I bought it

580
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
for Qiushi.

581
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,760
I was busy and forgot the cake.

582
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,200
It's fine.

583
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,240
Ask Minmin to take it to the station house.

584
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,160
Then ask Yuansheng

585
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,880
to take it home

586
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,680
for her.

587
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,320
He's left the Fourth Station House.

588
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,120
I don't think

589
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,520
your sister knows his address.

590
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,240
Did Li

591
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,680
give them the ride?

592
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,320
Yes.

593
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,000
How about this?

594
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,920
Ask him about his address.

595
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,440
Since I've bought it,

596
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,400
you'd be better to send it to her.

597
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,560
OK, I'll go now.

598
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,080
OK.

599
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,520
Li,

600
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,160
are you just off work?

601
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,840
Tianxiang.

602
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,400
Do you remember

603
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,600
the two people

604
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,680
I asked you to give ride?

605
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,160
What's their address?

606
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,480
I sent them to Wangyun Road.

607
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,680
What's the number?

608
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
No. 23, Wangyun Road.

609
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
OK, I see.

610
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,760
I'll leave you alone.

611
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,480
See you.

612
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
How about we eat together at your place?

613
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,160
Last time we asked you for money.

614
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,520
You said half a month.

615
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,080
Where's the money?

616
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,680
Where's the money?

617
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,200
I'm asking you where's the money?

618
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,480
I can't get that

619
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,600
much money.

620
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,280
You know

621
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,160
I work in a mahjong parlor.

622
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,480
My salary is small.

623
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,440
Shame on you.

624
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,240
I thought you were

625
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,840
a zinger.

626
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,880
How could you become a coward

627
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,920
after being

628
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,000
conscripted into the army?

629
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,120
Tianxiang,

630
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,680
Listen up.

631
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,120
We will come to get the money

632
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,680
tomorrow afternoon.

633
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,720
If we can't get the money,

634
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,960
not only will I

635
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
report you as a deserter,

636
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,640
but I will also

637
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,600
burn down your shop.

638
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,080
Believe it or not.

639
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,640
Please don't.

640
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
My dad is an honest man.

641
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
The photo shop has been his entire life.

642
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,760
About the money,

643
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,760
I'll try to get it

644
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
for you tomorrow.

645
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,160
Keep your word.

646
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,440
See you tomorrow.

647
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,000
Let's go.

648
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,760
[Someone is]

649
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,840
[looking for the girl]

650
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,920
[in the photo.]

651
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,400
The reward is a hundred silver dollar.

652
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,760
[How much?]

653
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,240
[A hundred silver dollar.]

654
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,520
Secretary Guo and the Chief

655
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,480
will be out in a minute.

656
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,440
The car is ready.

657
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,520
It's raining heavily.

658
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,680
Why don't you use an umbrella?

659
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,960
Secretary Guo came from Nanjing

660
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,000
to visit us.

661
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,440
You have to

662
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,760
escort the chief

663
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,240
to dinner

664
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,120
in person.

665
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,120
Consider it done.

666
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,520
Chief Tong,

667
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,920
you must be joking.

668
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
How's your father?

669
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Thank you for asking.

670
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,160
He's in good shape as always.

671
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,080
He asked me how you were the other day.

672
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,520
And wanted to play mahjong with you.

673
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,720
I've been busy with business lately.

674
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,240
I'll pay him a visit later.

675
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,920
Please tell his respectful

676
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,880
I won't go easy on him

677
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,440
next time.

678
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,000
Sure,

679
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,760
I'll tell him.

680
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,640
Take care.

681
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,200
Please.

682
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,360
You must be Captain Wei.

683
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,400
Yes, Sir!

684
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,840
I am Wei Daiqing.

685
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,520
I'm the head of the investigation team

686
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,680
of Shanghai Garrison Command.

687
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,600
Over.

688
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,240
I heard

689
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,680
it was you who went to Nanjing

690
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,400
and arrested

691
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,640
CPC espionage in the Navy Dept.

692
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,400
Yes, it was me.

693
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,840
I caught the spy

694
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,920
in the house of Undersecretary Hua

695
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,360
of the Ministry of Military Affairs.

696
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,320
The prisoner is still on trial.

697
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,120
Chief Tong,

698
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,280
many people complain about

699
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
the party's lack of vitality.

700
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,240
I don't think so.

701
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,520
Here's a pillar

702
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,080
who's bold

703
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,800
and vigorous.

704
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,120
Uncle,

705
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,120
Secretary Guo came all the way from

706
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,240
Nanjing military prosecution

707
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,920
to Shanghai.

708
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,400
I don't think

709
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,280
he's just here for

710
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,000
the Garrison Command.

711
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
You are right.

712
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,840
Did he come for the case

713
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
Wei Daiqing is up to?

714
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,560
If it weren't for the case,

715
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,120
how could he, the Secretary,

716
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,560
talk to a small potato

717
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,400
Wei Daiqing?

718
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,880
What's the mystery

719
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,400
of Deng Mingyuan's case?

720
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,920
Why did the military prosecution come?

721
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,440
It's like two tigers fighting.

722
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,880
Since Kong took over the Treasury,

723
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,320
he was criticized a lot

724
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,000
from inside of the party.

725
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
The Elder,

726
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,920
the Political Science,

727
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,840
and the CC cliques (Central Club)

728
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,880
are waiting for their chance to bring Kong down.

729
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,160
[Secretary Guo]

730
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,800
[was the backbone]

731
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,400
[of the CC clique.]

732
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,720
[While undersecretary Hua]

733
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,600
[is Kong's man.]

734
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,840
[This time,]

735
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,040
[Wei Daiqing caught a communist]

736
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,600
[at Undersecretary Hua's home.]

737
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,600
[Tell me,]

738
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,960
[how about it?]

739
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,120
I heard you applied

740
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,400
to the Party Investigation Division

741
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,160
for access

742
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,920
to Undersecretary Hua's review record.

743
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,320
I did.

744
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,840
But I was rejected.

745
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,400
Nanjing has placed great emphasis on 

746
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,040
Deng Mingyuan's case.

747
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,760
Because he had served in the Navy Dept

748
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
for a long time.

749
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,240
And this case involved

750
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,440
Undersecretary Hua.

751
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,760
It's normal

752
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
to meet with resistance.

753
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,880
It is my duty to serve the party-state.

754
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,080
No matter how much resistance there is,

755
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,560
I'll get to the bottom of that.

756
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,200
I believe

757
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,840
a senior

758
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,080
like Undersecretary Hua

759
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,400
can stand up to investigation.

760
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
Before I came to Shanghai,

761
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,440
I talked to a friend about Deng Mingyuan.

762
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,120
Before boarding Ship Yong Feng

763
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,280
and becoming a second mate of former president,

764
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,640
he was an ordinary navy.

765
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,960
Some people

766
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,800
live in the darkness.

767
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,520
It takes only one

768
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,880
encounter with superior power

769
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,720
for him to embrace brightness.

770
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,160
Otherwise,

771
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,320
there would be nothing left

772
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,280
in their fleeting lives.

773
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,960
Deng Mingyuan is no exception.

774
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,840
So are

775
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,320
others.

776
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Captain, we got a hit.

777
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,320
[Looking for a gentleman from the South.]

778
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,800
[Meng Duoci.]

779
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,680
The person Meng Duoci was looking for

780
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,200
was likely to be a communist close to

781
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,560
the Mengs, just like Deng Mingyuan.

782
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,280
If someone comes

783
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,400
to pick up the keys,

784
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,400
don't rush.

785
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,760
Follow him

786
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,400
and see where he goes.

787
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,160
Got it.
