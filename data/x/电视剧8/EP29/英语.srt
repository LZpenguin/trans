Shooting Stars EP29

3
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,400
I need to use the restroom.

4
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
Can't you understand me?

5
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,840
Find a spot to pull over.

6
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,440
Do you have to watch me pee?

7
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Mr... Mr. Hua...

8
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,600
Get out!

9
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
Please

10
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
don't make this difficult.

11
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,080
Mr. Hua...

12
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Mr. Hua.

13
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,960
Mr...

14
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,240
Thinking of running?

15
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Can you even escape?

16
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,000
How was it in the cold storage?

17
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Tell me,

18
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,280
where is Mr. Peng and his wife?

19
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,480
What exactly does Xiang Yuansheng

20
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,720
plan to do by saving them?

21
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,960
But what's plan by catching them?

22
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,440
I've told you,

23
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,040
Peng is a murderer.

24
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,240
As a cop,

25
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,280
it's my duty to arrest him.

26
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,840
This isn't an arrest.

27
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,080
But a kidnapping.

28
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
That day you pretended to be his wife

29
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,600
to play a scene with Xiang Yuansheng,

30
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
and you had an accomplice

31
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,680
who took him away.

32
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,040
Who was it?

33
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,200
Bai Shoujun?

34
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,120
Tian Dongbao?

35
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,000
Sun Hongfa?

36
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Or Chen Hao?

37
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,920
The Fourth Station has been disbanded.

38
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,360
Why do you guys

39
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,760
still stick together

40
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
like bad omens?

41
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
Why did Tian Dongbao's wife run?

42
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,040
What shameful things

43
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,280
did she tell you?

44
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,600
Didn't I tell you,

45
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,600
we're just talking about cooking.

46
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
You want to hear that too?

47
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm giving you one last chance.

48
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
Call Xiang Yuansheng,

49
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,960
and tell him to come to

50
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,680
the seafood company to replace you!

51
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,960
He's not in Shanghai.

52
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
Then call the S.M.C.!

53
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,880
If he wants to,

54
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
he can come from anywhere.

55
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,560
I need him to admit personally

56
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,680
that he's hiding

57
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,600
the journalist couple.

58
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
It's time for him to know

59
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
that his brother

60
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,520
and the surname

61
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,920
can't protect him from doing anything

62
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
and treat me like a fool!

63
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,280
He has to hand them over!

64
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,680
He's not in Shanghai,

65
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,520
and he's not coming.

66
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,280
Either he comes,

67
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,320
or you go back to the cold storage.

68
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,720
If you go back,

69
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,040
it won't be long before there's just

70
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,440
another female corpse.

71
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,440
Just stuff it in a barrel,

72
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
throw it into the sea,

73
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,600
and you'll disappear

74
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
from this world.

75
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,800
Xiang Yuansheng is different from you.

76
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
His name is Hua Zhen.

77
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
He has background.

78
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,520
Just call him here.

79
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm just going to scare him.

80
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,840
What are you afraid of?

81
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,480
He won't die here.

82
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
But you're different.

83
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,200
Killing you

84
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,280
is like stepping on an ant,

85
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,040
and no one will even glance down.

86
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,040
Once you go in there,

87
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,800
there's no coming out for you.

88
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,800
Think carefully.

89
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,680
Yuansheng!

90
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,080
Is Minmin home?

91
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,680
She's not.

92
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,960
Something might happen.

93
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,600
We haven't told her family yet.

94
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
What exactly happened?

95
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,520
Minmin went to meet Yu.

96
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
Suddenly, a few men appeared

97
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,280
and tried to capture them.

98
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,520
She helped Yu escape,

99
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,040
but she didn't get away herself.

100
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,520
Dongbao might be in trouble too.

101
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,840
He hasn't come home yet,

102
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
and I don't know if it's related

103
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,440
to those men.

104
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,320
Do you have any clues

105
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,400
about those men?

106
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,000
I...

107
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,800
They...

108
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,840
seemed

109
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,640
to have come from a truck.

110
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,960
Was that truck unlicensed?

111
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,040
Yes... it seemed to be.

112
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,680
I understand now.

113
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
They work for Feng Guangyun.

114
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,520
We'll go with you.

115
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,680
Yu, you shouldn't come.

116
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
But you can't go home now either.

117
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you have somewhere else to go?

118
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,640
I have relatives

119
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,040
in a rural part of Songjiang District.

120
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Then head there first.

121
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Don't come back

122
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,000
without hearing from us.

123
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,760
We'll also find Dongbao.

124
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,480
Get in!

125
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,160
Be careful.

126
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,640
Don't do anything stupid!

127
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,560
Looks like quite a few people there.

128
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,240
Could Minmin be inside?

129
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,200
Last time here,

130
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,560
there were only two workers.

131
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,680
It's clearly more this time,

132
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,360
probably to

133
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,440
guard Luo Minmin.

134
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,200
Aren't we understaffed

135
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,440
to just walk in?

136
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,640
No more work,

137
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,920
come play mahjong!

138
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,160
Right away.

139
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,960
Hurry up!

140
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,520
Erbai,

141
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,480
can you drive this car?

142
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,280
Yes.

143
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,720
Good.

144
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,400
Let's split up.

145
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,920
Nine bamboos.

146
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,160
Five characters.

147
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,960
Pong.

148
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,720
Two characters.

149
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,360
Nine bamboos.

150
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,440
Pong.

151
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,440
Stop dawdling!

152
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,760
Six characters.

153
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,920
Red dragon.

154
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,320
Five characters.

155
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,400
Five characters, pong.

156
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,480
Smash it!

157
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,240
Quick!

158
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,800
Get inside!

159
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,720
How many people are here?

160
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,400
Stop! Run!

161
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,280
I haven't finished yet!

162
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,760
After them!

163
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,320
Why isn't it starting?

164
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Don't panic!

165
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,240
There you go.

166
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,000
Come on!

167
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,200
You five chase them by car!

168
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes!

169
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,920
Hurry!

170
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,440
Move!

171
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,800
Everyone

172
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
stay sharp tonight!

173
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,360
Where is Luo Minmin?

174
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,360
Where is she?

175
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,240
Quick!

176
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,000
Someone's broken in!

177
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,360
Hello, Mr. Feng,

178
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
someone has shown up.

179
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,640
Is it Xiang Yuansheng?

180
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,720
Not sure yet.

181
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
What if it's him?

182
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,800
Capture him directly!

183
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,720
I need him to settle scores

184
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
with Hua Liang.

185
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,560
Use whatever necessary

186
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,960
to hold him.

187
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,040
I'm on my way with backup.

188
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
Understood.

189
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,000
Group one,

190
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,560
go to the armory to get weapons.

191
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,480
Come with me.

192
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,480
Yes!

193
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,240
Is it the gas station

194
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,200
Yuansheng mentioned?

195
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,800
Yes.

196
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,040
They've followed us here.

197
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,680
Just like he said,

198
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,520
we'll draw them away

199
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,360
and leave the car for him.

200
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,640
Okay.

201
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,200
Let's move!

202
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,320
Dongbao.

203
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,120
Tian Dongbao...

204
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Tian Dongbao!

205
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,200
Tian Dongbao!

206
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,000
Tian Dongbao!

207
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,840
Tian Dongbao...

208
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,720
Help!

209
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,760
Is anyone there?

210
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
Someone help!

211
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,880
Help!

212
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
Is anyone there?

213
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,280
Stop!

214
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,720
You're here for the keys, right?

215
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,520
Don't bother,

216
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,640
I have them.

217
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,240
I knew you'd come

218
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,600
for Luo Minmin.

219
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,440
Mr. Feng has already told me...

220
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,200
Minmin.

221
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,160
Are you okay?

222
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,160
Are you alright?

223
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
Dongbao...

224
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,520
He...

225
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,640
Secure the perimeter.

226
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Don't let anyone go!

227
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,120
Hold your fire

228
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,040
until I give the order.

229
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,040
I want Xiang Yuansheng alive.

230
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,920
Yes, sir!

231
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,600
Gunshots there.

232
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,760
Is it Xiang Yuansheng?

233
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,120
Yes.

234
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,400
Hua Zhen!

235
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,680
The reporter you took away

236
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,400
is a murderer!

237
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,680
You're not only

238
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,000
obstructing police work

239
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,960
but harboring a criminal.

240
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,280
You could be considered an accomplice,

241
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,400
and we have you surrounded!

242
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,960
Are you alright?

243
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,240
You're now resisting arrest with violence!

244
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:57,960
Minmin!

245
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,360
This is your last chance!

246
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,840
Minmin!

247
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,360
Hand over your weapon,

248
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,040
or I am authorized

249
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,400
to order them to shoot!

250
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Load your guns!

251
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,520
Mr. Feng,

252
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,200
why did you shoot at Hua Zhen?

253
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
If he gets shot,

254
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,400
things could get pretty ugly.

255
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
There's a body discovered.

256
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,640
Seal off the area

257
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,880
and call in forensic services now.

258
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes!

259
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,560
Also,

260
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,200
the suspect might be

261
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,920
among those

262
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,200
who just fled.

263
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,120
Send out alerts

264
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,080
to clinics,

265
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,640
hospitals,

266
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,760
and pharmacies immediately.

267
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,120
Anyone with gunshot wounds

268
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,080
or seeking anti-inflammatories

269
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,960
or frostbite treatments for gun wounds

270
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,840
must be reported!

271
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,320
Copy that!

272
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,200
Follow me!

273
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,440
Yes!

274
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,800
Let's go!

275
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,560
Come on.

276
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,160
Chen Hao!

277
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,240
Chen Hao!

278
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
I've been shot.

279
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,680
How is Minmin?

280
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,720
Hypothermia.

281
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,680
She was in that cold storage

282
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,520
we visited before

283
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,320
for too long.

284
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,160
Make sure to keep her warm.

285
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,880
You need to stop the bleeding.

286
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,160
Chen Hao!

287
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,160
Chen Hao!

288
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,720
Chen Hao!

289
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,200
Sir,

290
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,840
do you have any antibiotics?

291
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,560
What do you need?

292
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,560
Sulfanilamide powder.

293
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,320
I don't have that.

294
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,080
Sulfanilamide is ridiculously expensive now.

295
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,840
How about alcohol and saline?

296
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,720
I have.

297
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,960
Also need some frostbite medicine,

298
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,840
bandages, gauze.

299
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,080
Frostbite medicine.

300
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,840
Gauze.

301
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,800
I have

302
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,680
other disinfectants

303
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,280
available, like...

304
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,680
Give them

305
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,120
anything antiseptic!

306
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
Take this money and give me

307
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,800
whatever it can buy.

308
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,280
Okay.

309
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,480
Sir,

310
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,840
do you know where

311
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,040
I might still be able to buy sulfanilamide?

312
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
It's more expensive than gold right now.

313
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,720
You won't easily find it even in big clinics

314
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
or back-alley hospitals.

315
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
But if you really want it,

316
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,880
I could try to get it for you,

317
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,920
though it won't be cheap

318
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,640
and

319
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,080
you'd have to

320
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,440
pay me for the trouble.

321
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,640
This watch

322
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,480
is quite valuable.

323
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
Could you make a run for me?

324
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,560
Sure,

325
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,880
come back tomorrow morning.

326
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,880
Okay.

327
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,240
Sir,

328
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,080
with this watch,

329
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,560
can I also trade for a blanket

330
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,640
and some food?

331
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,400
Take whatever you need.

332
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,480
Thank you.

333
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,400
Captain!

334
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,880
Captain!

335
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,120
You're awake.

336
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,960
Here,

337
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,640
you need to keep warm.

338
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,240
What about Captain?

339
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,480
How's he doing?

340
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,240
He's been shot.

341
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
The bullet went from his back to his chest.

342
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,520
Fortunately, it didn't hit

343
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,760
any major blood vessels

344
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,080
or organs,

345
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,840
so there's no heavy bleeding.

346
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,000
I've managed to stop the bleeding.

347
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,720
Chen Hao,

348
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,400
don't move yet.

349
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,240
Captain...

350
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,200
The bullet went straight through.

351
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,360
We can't go to the hospital or clinics

352
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,480
due to the police there.

353
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,040
There's no sulfanilamide available.

354
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,360
All I can do is to stop

355
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,800
the bleeding and disinfect the wound.

356
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,360
I'll make it through.

357
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
I've always been lucky.

358
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,440
Are you alright?

359
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,480
What's wrong,

360
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,840
kiddo?

361
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,800
Why are you crying?

362
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,440
Bad news awaiting?

363
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,720
You just got your life back.

364
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,800
We'll talk tomorrow.

365
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,080
Tell me now.

366
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,120
Should I start guessing names?

367
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,400
Tell me,

368
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
what happened?

369
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,240
Speak up.

370
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
It's about Tian Dongbao.

371
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,680
What happened?

372
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,720
Did the police catch him?

373
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,640
Dongbao is no longer with us.

374
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,640
What...

375
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,800
do you mean

376
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,600
by "no longer with us"?

377
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,640
What does that mean?

378
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,000
Yu said

379
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,200
it's raining on the night before Dongbao

380
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
had an accident.

381
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,120
He went to the warehouse to clean,

382
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,960
worrying the goods

383
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,200
might get wet.

384
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,040
He went to

385
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,160
close

386
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,680
the windows...

387
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,080
but..

388
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,240
then...

389
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,080
he discovered smuggled military supplies

390
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,520
and reported it..

391
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,920
Finding Minmin

392
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,040
in the cold storage,

393
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,960
I also saw Dongbao.

394
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,000
He's about to become a father...

395
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,800
Why would they do this to him?

396
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,000
Why?

397
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm here with some good news.

398
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,080
I'm going to be a dad!

399
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,120
Propose a toast to Dongbao!

400
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,800
To Dongbao!

401
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,520
Come on,

402
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,680
congratulations!

403
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,880
Congrats!

404
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,480
Yu, you're going to be a mom!

405
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,720
My name is Tian Dongbao!

406
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,240
My family makes a living by raising chickens.

407
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,960
My dad didn't want me to do this.

408
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,440
He said being a cop

409
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,800
pays better.

410
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,040
Miss Luo,

411
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,880
you go ahead!

412
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,040
You can't get in!

413
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Captain.

414
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,040
It's okay, Captain.

415
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,440
Yuansheng!

416
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,040
Yuansheng!

417
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,360
I'm Dongbao.

418
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,520
Dongbao?

419
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,040
Yuansheng,

420
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,200
do you have time to come over

421
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,680
for dinner tonight?

422
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,800
I'll invite everyone

423
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,520
from the Fourth Station.
