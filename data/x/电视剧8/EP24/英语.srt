Shooting Stars EP24

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,920
I gave Feng

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
one last week.

5
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,000
If Peng doesn't

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
talk by then,

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
I'll get rid of him.

8
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,640
You're a policeman.

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,320
How you handle cases is your expertise.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,760
As for my brother,

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,760
I must resolve it myself.

12
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,400
No one else is allowed to interfere.

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,080
Sir,

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,960
what did Mr. Hua say?

15
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,480
Does he know where Hua Zhen

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,440
hid that woman?

17
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
What else would he say?

18
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,080
Of course, he denies

19
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
everything cleanly.

20
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,760
And Mr. Nakamura?

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,080
Nakamura said

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,760
it's a domestic matter of the Huas.

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
Now that

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,440
Hua Liang

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
is QX JV Corp's

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,760
representative,

27
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,640
as long as he honors the agreement,

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,000
Nakamura

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,840
certainly won't displease him.

30
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,960
It just leaves us

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
to deal with the problem?

32
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Assign two men to keep an eye on Hua Zhen.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,680
You suspect that woman

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,920
is with Hua Zhen?

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,640
But Mr. Nakamura said

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,280
it's their family matter.

37
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Hua Liang is returning to Nanjing

38
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
tomorrow morning.

39
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,160
Whether it's his family matter or not,

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,640
we'll find out.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,920
Understood.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,120
The only chip I have

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,400
at this poker table

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
is that I can

45
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,920
offer protection for their deals.

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,240
Now that this woman has disappeared,

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,000
it would end up being my fault,

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,240
and I'm the only one

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
who could be kicked out in the end.

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,760
Hua Liang insisted

51
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,840
that his brother's matters

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
can only be solved by him,

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
and no one else can interfere.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,200
But this is Shanghai.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
His words

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,920
carry no weight here.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,160
Got it.

58
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
Mrs. Peng has been settled in

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,120
a secure house managed by the NSO.

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
She'll stay here

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,640
until we locate Mr. Peng.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll take care of her in the French Concession.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,640
Good.

64
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,080
What's wrong?

65
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,680
I pointed a gun at Xiang Yuansheng.

66
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,080
He was the one

67
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,440
who helped me rescue Mrs. Peng.

68
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,160
Have you eaten yet?

69
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,120
There's a good

70
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
French restaurant nearby.

71
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,560
Let's go.

72
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,160
Sorry,

73
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,320
I forgot they close

74
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,480
at this hour.

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
It's okay.

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,760
I'm not a big fan

77
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,040
of Western food anyway.

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,200
Let's go to this noodle stall

79
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,080
I frequent.

80
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,560
Boss, are you still open?

81
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,720
We're closed.

82
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,040
You go ahead.

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,960
I'll serve myself.

84
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,600
Okay,

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,560
help yourself.

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,720
You warm up by the fire. It's too cold.

87
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Xiang Yuansheng has

88
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,520
already heard about

89
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,600
the photo from Mrs. Peng

90
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,520
and began to suspect his brother

91
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,560
might be involved.

92
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,840
So you're saying

93
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,120
he can't

94
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,680
distance himself from this?

95
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,080
He might not

96
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
need to.

97
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,720
What do you mean?

98
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,680
I just found out.

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,560
Leader Deng

100
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,640
had proposed recruiting Xiang Yuansheng

101
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
to the organization before,

102
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,400
but we

103
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
never initiated

104
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,320
because of the high risk.

105
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,920
It might

106
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,520
be the right time now.

107
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,480
He is already

108
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,640
deeply involved,

109
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,360
and Mr. Peng's case

110
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,880
isn't just an organizational task.

111
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
It's part of your duties as a policeman too.

112
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,280
If he is willing

113
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,840
to get involved,

114
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,160
the organization thinks

115
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,600
you two could collaborate,

116
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,880
and we want you

117
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,040
to observe him.

118
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,040
The organization wants us to collaborate

119
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,800
and me to observe him?

120
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
Why did they suddenly

121
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
decide so?

122
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,520
I have no experience with this kind of thing.

123
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
I requested it.

124
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,680
Really?

125
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes.

126
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,080
But I just

127
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
pointed a gun at him today.

128
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,720
If he knows

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
his brother might be involved,

130
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,120
he'll understand your reaction.

131
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
Really?

132
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,520
Let's hope so.

133
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
Why are you laughing?

134
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,960
Comrade Chen Hao,

135
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,280
you really need to practice

136
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,680
controlling your facial expressions.

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,360
Also,

138
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,280
your noodles are about to burn.

139
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,840
Here, have a taste.

140
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,400
I've already had dinner.

141
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
I can only cook noodles,

142
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,280
but I make

10143
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,360
amazing taste. *said in Shanghai accent

10144
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,360
What does it mean?

10145
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,960
It means delicious in Shanghainese.

10146
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
It tastes amazing. *said in Shanghai accent

147
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
Thank you.

148
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,880
-Is Mrs Peng safe now? -Yes

149
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,440
I've heard about that photo.

150
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,800
You must have learned it.

151
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
The one with my brother, a Japanese man,

152
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,760
and Tan Shiyuan

153
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,040
all together.

154
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,280
Yes.

155
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
During the time

156
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,720
I was back at the S.M.C.,

157
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,560
my brother came from Nanjing

158
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,880
to visit me in Jiangyin.

159
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,880
He made an excuse of visiting me

160
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,280
for probing into

161
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,440
the Fourth Station and Mr. Peng's case.

162
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
He claimed he made the inquiry on behalf of a friend

163
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
about Mr. Peng's whereabouts.

164
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,520
But I know

165
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
my brother doesn't

166
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,280
help anyone that way.

167
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,480
He doesn't have

168
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,640
that kind of friend.

169
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,520
After what happened with Wei Daiqing,

170
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,280
he's been particularly fearful

171
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
of my having any connection to Shanghai.

172
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,560
He spares no efforts in telling me

173
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,040
not to mention

174
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,400
anything about Shanghai,

175
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,840
yet it was he who brought it up.

176
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,040
There's only one possibility:

177
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
the incident behind this

178
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,880
is threatening him

179
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
or the interests of the Hua family.

180
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,960
You came here today

181
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,920
to ask what really happened

182
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,200
in Mr. Peng's disappearance, right?

183
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,880
You know something, right?

184
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,560
I don't.

185
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,880
I helped Mrs. Peng

186
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,840
on behalf of Mr. Peng's friends,

187
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,600
and they are as in the dark as I am.

188
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,880
My brother told me

189
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,320
Mr. Peng wasn't just missing.

190
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,680
He was secretly arrested

191
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,800
for murder.

192
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,200
I really can't bring myself

193
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,600
to believe him.

194
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Are you curious

195
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,360
about the case?

196
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,440
It's not about curiosity.

197
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,960
It's about unease.

198
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,880
I have doubts,

199
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,200
and only finding Mr. Peng

200
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,280
will answer them.

201
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,160
I'm investigating this case

202
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,040
because I'm a police officer.

203
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,000
It's my job,

204
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,760
something I must do.

205
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,000
But you're different.

206
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,920
You're back at school.

207
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,960
You have your own duties,

208
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,640
receiving ships, marine training,

209
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,640
none of which

210
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,720
relate to

211
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,840
Mr. Peng's disappearance.

212
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
Do you really want to disrupt

213
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,280
your life plans just for an answer?

214
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,880
Although

215
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,680
Mr. Peng's disappearance

216
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,360
has nothing to do

217
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
with my personal life plans,

218
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,360
If it involves my brother,

219
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,840
it concerns me.

220
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
I need to know the truth.

221
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,600
No matter

222
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,440
how harsh it might be.

223
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,200
You wouldn't be investigating alone.

224
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
If you're willing,

225
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,240
we can collaborate

226
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
until we find Mr. Peng.

227
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,840
How about that?

228
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Do you have a lead?

229
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,320
That truck

230
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,400
that chased Mrs. Peng,

231
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,080
was there

232
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,160
for the Meng family

233
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
murder investigation.

234
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,160
Right after

235
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,120
we stepped out the Japanese restaurant,

236
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,080
a license-less truck

237
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,800
shot at us.

238
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,520
Last night, I followed it

239
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,640
until it disappeared

240
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,600
on Fuhua Road.

241
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,920
I suspect their hideout

242
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,120
is on that road.

243
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
Had you already planned this?

244
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,440
Promise me,

245
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,440
don't tell Erbai

246
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
and the others about this.

247
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,840
Since the Fourth Station was disbanded,

248
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,400
I've seldom been in touch with them.

249
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,840
Afraid of getting them into trouble?

250
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
It's not that complicated.

251
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,760
Tomorrow, 7 PM,

252
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,920
at the intersection of Fuhua Road.

253
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,120
It's late. You should head back.

254
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,560
Wait a minute.

255
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,480
Why didn't you just

256
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,000
tell me straight at the hospital?

257
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,400
If you had,

258
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,080
I would have handed her over to you.

259
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,640
Which choice was harder for you?

260
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,800
What?

261
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,000
Have a gun pointed at you,

262
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,000
or to choose between helping your brother

263
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,680
and helping me,

264
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,800
which is harder?

265
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,920
Welcome back.

266
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,160
Mr. Hua,

267
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,600
your ticket back to Nanjing for tomorrow

268
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,480
has been booked.

269
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,720
As usual,

270
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,040
first flight in the morning.

271
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,040
Change it to the afternoon flight.

272
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,320
I have a friend to meet.

273
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,240
Understood.

274
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:48,960
Hua Zhen,

275
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,680
who was the girl waiting for you that night?

276
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,720
Who is she to you?

277
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
What girl?

278
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,520
I don't know her.

279
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,400
Dressed something like

280
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,320
a police uniform but not quite,

281
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,360
standing alone

282
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,240
under the tree on that chilly night.

283
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Her face all red from the cold.

284
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,040
When did this happen?

285
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,240
The same night your brother

286
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
came to see you.

287
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,520
She was asking us

288
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
if you got home safely.

289
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,120
I thought

290
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,040
you knew about it.

291
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,160
Yuansheng!

292
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:13,920
Yuansheng!

293
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,360
Erbai?

294
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,600
He's a friend. You guys go ahead.

295
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
Okay. Let's go.

296
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
What are you doing here?

297
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,600
Yuansheng,

298
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,600
Dongbao got hurt at the dock.

299
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,000
Well,

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,520
folks from the Fourth Station want to visit him.

301
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,920
Are you coming?

302
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,320
Okay.

303
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,080
Wait a sec.

304
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,920
I'll request a car.

305
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,840
No need.

306
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,800
I have a car, remember?

307
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,720
I'm a taxi driver now.

308
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,120
Get in. Let's go.

309
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,840
How did Dongbao get hurt?

310
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,200
He was working in the warehouse at the docks.

311
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,320
Probably starving

312
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,040
and too much weight,

313
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
ended up fainting

314
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,760
and injuring his hand.

315
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,280
Has he thought about changing jobs?

316
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,080
Change jobs?

317
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,800
That kid,

318
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,680
he really fell in love with being a cop,

319
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,520
submitted a retention application,

320
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,720
and has been waiting for a new assignment ever since.

321
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,720
But up to now,

322
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,040
there hasn't been any news.

323
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,760
Now,

324
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,960
he's just waiting

325
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,040
and making a living.

326
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,520
So is Yu,

327
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
working hard at the docks

328
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,240
from dawn till dusk.

329
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,840
He just wants to open

330
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
a breakfast shop for Yu.

331
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,840
So he could get back

332
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,760
to being a police officer,

333
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,760
giving birth to a couple of kids,

334
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,800
what happy days.

335
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,440
Honestly,

336
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,800
we bring stuff to Dongbao

337
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,920
not because he can't afford it.

338
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,000
We just hope

339
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,320
they save up their money

340
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
to have

341
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,280
a better life sooner.

342
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
They will make it.

343
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,080
They're working so hard

344
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,840
won't go unrewarded.

345
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,520
Exactly.

346
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,680
Erbai.

347
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,760
Minmin.

348
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,200
Where is chief and the others	?

349
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
They haven't arrived yet.

350
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,960
Alright,

351
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
then let's wait for them.

352
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,760
We'll go in together.

353
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,560
These guys,

354
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,240
they all agreed to come see Dongbao,

355
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
but they're not showing any urgency.

356
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,200
Agreed on the timing

357
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,600
but have no sense of punctuality.

358
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,040
This is unbelie...

359
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:56,960
I'll go...

360
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,720
I'll just...

361
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,200
I'll see if they're coming.

362
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,280
That day, it was my brother

363
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,480
who drove me back to the dorm.

364
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
That day at the hospital,

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,040
it was him who took me back.

366
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,760
He just wanted me

367
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,320
not to get involved with Mr. Peng's case

368
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
and didn't make things difficult for me.

369
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm okay.

370
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,280
That day,

371
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,200
the Captain told me you were fine.

372
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,600
so I went straight home.

373
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Why are you laughing?

374
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,040
We are waiting for you.

375
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
Come on.

376
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,000
You two have

377
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,680
lost track of time.

378
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,800
Apologize

379
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,160
Just as usual.

380
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,080
My share.

381
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,480
Here's mine.

382
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,520
Mine.

383
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,240
OK.

384
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,840
Let's go.

385
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,720
That's a lot of money.

386
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,480
Dongbao,

387
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,680
what did the doctor say?

388
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,120
He said nothing serious.

389
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,640
I just need to have some days off.

390
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,440
Watch this.

391
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,720
Listen to me,

392
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,800
you should take it more seriously

393
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,080
and rest for at least three months.

394
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,480
Just have a good rest

395
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,040
and we will

396
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,120
help you with your chores.

397
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,680
Yes.

398
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,480
Thank you Director.

399
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,120
Director, Erbai,

400
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,320
have some water.

401
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,040
I'll bring more.

402
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,200
Don't bother.

403
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,200
It's okay.

404
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,080
I'm supposed to...

405
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,240
Yu,

406
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,640
we hope this can help you.

407
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,040
Minmin you don't need to...

408
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,080
Take it.

409
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,200
No I can't.

410
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Dongbao told

411
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
we can't rely on you anymore.

412
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,680
Do you consider me a sister?

413
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,800
If you do, you should accept it.

414
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,480
Here.

415
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,000
Take it.

416
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,120
But I...

417
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,880
Dongbao,

418
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,640
Minmin gives us money again.

419
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,680
Minmin,

420
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,720
we can't accept it.

421
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,760
Please take it back.

422
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,560
Every time you come

423
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,760
to visit us you bring so many

424
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,560
food and money.

425
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,440
No more, I refuse.

426
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,080
Put it back.

427
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,520
What about the food you served us?

428
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,200
It must cost a lot.

429
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Yeah, here's

430
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,880
the payment of the meals.

431
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,680
But

432
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,000
the ingredients

433
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,560
are given by you guys.

434
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,200
You don't need to pay.

435
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,760
Erbai told us

436
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,600
you and Yu

437
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,880
want to start up a breakfast shop

438
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,080
and we want to invest in it.

439
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,120
Yes.

440
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,480
Here's our investment.

441
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,280
So just accept it.

442
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,280
If you insist on not accepting,

443
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,040
we will leave.

444
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,560
I'm leaving now.

445
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,840
Don't go.

446
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,880
Listen to me.

447
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
Yu, take the money.

448
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,560
Dongbao,

449
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,600
take it.

450
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Take it.

451
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,240
Take it.

452
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,840
Take it.

453
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,560
OK, thank all of you guys.

454
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,520
But we should make a deal

455
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,440
that every time you come in the future,

456
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,040
I will use this money to buy meat

457
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,360
and cook soy-braised pork for you.

458
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,240
Deal?

459
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,560
When it comes to the pork,

460
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,080
I feel hungry now.

461
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,160
I'll cook.

462
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,200
Go ahead.

463
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,560
Director,

464
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,680
take a seat.

465
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,560
Be careful.

466
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,360
Take good care of yourself.

467
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,920
I'm fine.

468
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,240
Yuansheng, be my guest.

469
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm home.

470
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,080
Can we talk?

471
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,400
I don't want to.

472
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,680
Go home.

473
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,120
Why didn't you write to me?

474
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
Didn't you receive my letters?

475
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,240
I had been waiting for your letter

476
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,040
for one week,

477
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,160
two weeks,

478
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,440
then more than a month.

479
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,160
Now here you are

480
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,120
but what for?

481
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,600
We are

482
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,840
not where we were.

483
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,240
I wrote to you since the first day

484
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,400
I went back to school.

485
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,840
One letter every three days

486
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,240
and more than ten letters in total.

487
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
Did you write?

488
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,360
I did,

489
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,760
and I was also waiting for your reply.

490
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,640
I thought you were engaged

491
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,080
in Nanjing

492
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,440
and

493
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,960
shouldn't have written letters to me.

494
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,760
My brother told you I was engaged?

495
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,840
Are you?

496
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,200
Do you hope so?

497
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,720
I don't know.

498
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,520
Think it over

499
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,600
with your blockhead.

500
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,880
You can always talk

501
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,120
to me,

502
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,240
and ask about anything

503
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,360
you want to know directly.

504
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,840
Why assuming

505
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,600
with your head in the clouds.

506
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,560
I wonder what else

507
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,800
are there in your head.

508
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,280
I wish you were engaged.

509
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,160
You'd better think twice before answering.

510
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,640
I couldn't

511
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,040
be clearer.

512
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,600
Before I adore you,

513
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,480
I got the last place

514
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,560
for whatever I did.

515
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,520
I took police examination

516
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,400
for three years and failed.

517
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,320
At least I was happy at that time.

518
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,640
But now,

519
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
I wish I were muddleheaded.

520
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,040
I cannot.

521
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,840
Before you adore me?

522
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,840
Yes.

523
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,440
Now you know

524
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,760
why I don't want to see you anymore?

525
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,680
If there was a day I don't want to see you,

526
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,000
the only reason would be

527
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,960
I don't like you anymore.

528
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,320
Hope that help

529
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,920
remove the blind

530
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,040
and disorderly conjectures in your head.

531
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,240
You...

532
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,680
You said I make blind

533
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
and disorderly conjectures,

534
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,080
and I have a block head.

535
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,240
What about you?

536
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,760
If letters couldn't reach me,

537
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,120
why didn't you

538
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,720
try other methods to reach me?

539
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,440
You bastard!

540
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,800
Who do you think you are?

541
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,640
Dad!

542
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,920
Who do you think you are?

543
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,320
Dad!

544
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,880
Get away!

545
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,360
No.

546
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,880
Get away!

547
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,840
Run!

548
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,280
Don't escape!

549
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,800
Dad!

550
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,920
How dare you?

551
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,600
How dare you?

552
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,400
Dad!

553
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,720
Who do you think you are?

554
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,120
Dad!

555
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,320
Jerk!

556
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,760
Don't be mad.

557
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,280
The broom is gone.

558
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,200
We only have one broom.

559
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,640
I think you forget

560
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,080
who is your elder sister.

561
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,480
Tell me

562
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,040
what did you do

563
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,440
in the middle of night.

564
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
None of your business.

565
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,480
Give it to me.

566
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,560
Luo Qinqin.

567
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,040
Garbage collection!

568
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,400
Garbage collection!

569
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,880
Who's that?

570
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Hold.

571
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,440
Hold.

572
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,640
Hold it.

573
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,200
I've told you

574
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,520
I'll pay you

575
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,880
the rent next month.

576
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,640
Hello, are you Mr. Wei?

577
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,880
Who are you?

578
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,920
I don't think I know you.

579
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,200
I am Jin.

580
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,200
I was introduced to meet you.

581
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,600
I know

582
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,320
you've left

583
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,840
the investigation team of Shanghai

584
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,360
Garrison Command.

585
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,000
But your great ability

586
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,040
to capture communists

587
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
shouldn't go ignored.

588
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm here today

589
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,240
to ask you

590
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,680
do you still have interest

591
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,120
in working as an intelligence agent.

592
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,440
You know I've left

593
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,280
then you must know

594
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,680
why I left.

595
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,120
I offended

596
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,120
the Undersecretary of Ministry of Military Affairs,

597
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,360
as well as

598
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,000
the secretary of Office of Aides.

599
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,680
My political future

600
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,120
has been ruined.

601
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I don't think so.

602
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,520
This time I'll invite you

603
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,560
to a place

604
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
where the Chairman Chiang serves as the president

605
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,360
and under his direct leadership.

606
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,680
What are you talking about?

607
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,000
The Shanghai Station under the Secret Service Office

608
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,680
of the Revival Society.

609
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,160
I know you haven't given up

610
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,440
on investigating Hua Zhen.

611
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,120
My people told me

612
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,400
you are

613
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,560
frequent near a

614
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,800
public phone booth lately.

615
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,800
The public phone booth...

616
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,680
That public phone booth

617
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,920
is the only omission

618
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
when I investigated him.

619
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,560
The communist named Zhang Runjin

620
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,000
was in the hospital.

621
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,000
He called the public phone booth

622
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,960
at 9:06 in the morning.

623
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,880
Look at this.

624
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,400
I was putting all my energy

625
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
into investigating Xiang Yuansheng

626
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,120
and the belt,

627
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
having neglected the phone booth.

628
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,720
When I went over it

629
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,680
I realized

630
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,600
why Zhang Runjin

631
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,200
insisted to call a public phone booth

632
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,000
even though he was

633
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,400
stabbed with a knife

634
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,000
and bleeding all over.

635
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Why!

636
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,120
Because this is their

637
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,560
hidden contact means.

638
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,640
In other words,

639
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,240
his associate

640
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,800
was near

641
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,760
the public phone booth.

642
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
And now you have the chance

643
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,000
to repair the omission.

644
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,440
Hua Zhen is in Shanghai.

645
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,360
If you prefer

646
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,760
to join in the Secret Service Office,

647
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
I will put you

648
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,320
on investigating Hua Zhen

649
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,320
and digging out

650
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,800
all the communists related to him.

651
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,800
He is in Shanghai now.

652
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,440
Yes.

653
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,120
You are...

654
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,760
Are you dispatched by Secretary Guo

655
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,800
to reach me?

656
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,200
Secretary Guo is not the only one

657
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
who needs you.

658
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,360
My boss is Mr. Yu,

659
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,040
"Yu" for slow-witted wisdom in English.

660
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,800
Whereas you are

661
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,280
meant to

662
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,640
continue investigating Hua Zhen,

663
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,440
why don't we

664
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,360
work together.

665
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,560
Here's the outlay,

666
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,680
a sign of sincerity from Mr. Yu.

667
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,920
Come and report for duty

668
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,640
if you want to tomorrow.

669
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,360
I was deserted

670
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,640
from Shanghai Garrison Command

671
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,040
and you must know it.

672
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,920
Like a stray dog.

673
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,000
So I'm curious

674
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,760
What's in me

675
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,320
that attracts

676
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,360
Mr. Yu?

677
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,960
Have you heard of National Salvation Organization?

678
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,000
Not an expert,

679
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,360
But I have been

680
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,120
investigating CPC

681
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,440
for more than seven years.

682
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,480
The NSO was one of my targets.

683
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Back in those days,

684
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,360
I did collect much information

685
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,240
about the NSO.

686
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,960
We heard some news

687
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,600
Hua Zhen is in close contact

688
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,600
with Pro-Communist individuals

689
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,640
in the NSO

690
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,400
There might be some communists.

691
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,080
If we start form the NSO,

692
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,480
Mr. Wei,

693
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,000
you are our best choice.

694
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
But this time

695
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,800
we hope

696
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,960
to change the sequence.

697
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,040
We should first figure out

698
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,480
the communists around Hua Zhen.

699
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,080
When I was in the Garrison Command

700
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,760
I'd proved the two people,

701
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,120
Deng Mingyuan and Zhang Runjin

702
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,160
who were close to Hua Zhen

703
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,240
are both communists.

704
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,840
How could Hua Zhen be innocent?

705
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
If it were not for his powerful family

706
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,120
I was supposed to pull him down.

707
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Why do you

708
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,160
still take a wrong path

709
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,760
and investigate communists around him?

710
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,400
Why not

711
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,880
inquire into him directly?

712
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,000
Hua Zhen must be suspicious

713
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,960
so he is

714
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,240
our final objective.

715
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,360
But Mr. Yu suggests

716
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,760
we check from people around him.

717
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,360
That will be easier.

718
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,480
What if

719
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,760
What if I can

720
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,760
get you the evidence

721
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,480
to prove Hua Zhen is a communist,

722
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,240
Does your

723
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,360
Mr. Yu

724
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,720
have the ability

725
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,240
to prevent the Huas from interfering?

726
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,080
Mr. Yu reaches you

727
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,480
because he has the confidence.

728
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,120
There's only one requirement

729
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,880
that you need to keep everything in secret.

730
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,240
You can use forces

731
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,480
of the Secret Service.

732
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,400
But all the intelligence

733
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,640
about Hua Zhen

734
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,480
must be reported to me first

735
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
and I'll transfer it to Mr. Yu.

736
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,240
No leaks.

737
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,840
Otherwise,

738
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,720
we'll terminate the commission.

739
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,760
Where should I go tomorrow?

740
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,240
The Anqi Beer Company in French Concession.

741
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,080
I'll be waiting for you.
