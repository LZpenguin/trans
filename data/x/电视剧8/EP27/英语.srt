1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,160
Shooting Stars EP27

3
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,080
I think deep down I know the answer.

4
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,920
You probably do too.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
But for some reason,

6
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,400
there's still

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,600
a sliver of hope in me.

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,360
I'll handle

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,600
the investigation from here.

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,080
You've made many decisions

11
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,920
bringing us

12
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,080
to this point.

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
You don't need

14
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
to face this

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
final part alone.

16
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,240
I'll bring you back to the Shipyard.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,480
No need.

18
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,720
I can drive now.

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,320
It's my turn

20
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,800
to take you back.

21
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,600
You should head back and rest.

22
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
I can drive the car in myself.

23
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Xiang Yuansheng.

24
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
When will you head back for Jiangyin?

25
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,600
Tomorrow.

26
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,960
Go back.

27
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,960
The Captain is right.

28
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,680
You don't need

29
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,080
to face this alone.

30
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,920
I have a brother too.

31
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,200
If it were me,

32
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,480
I'd feel the same.

33
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Although your brother

34
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,000
was involved

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
as Mr. Peng speculated.

36
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
This has nothing to do

37
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,440
with yourself.

38
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,160
I'm leaving

39
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
for Jiangyin

40
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
with the school today.

41
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,360
A new batch of

42
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,840
torpedo boats has arrived.

43
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,080
We need to bring them back.

44
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,120
Got it.

45
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,520
Go back and train well.

46
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,360
I plan to

47
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,880
take a leave to return to Nanjing.

48
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,440
As Mr. Peng speculated,

49
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,160
if

50
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,320
my brother

51
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,720
was involved,

52
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,920
taking money from Nakamura Naoki,

53
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,200
then he must have kept ledgers

54
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
and receipts.

55
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,080
He wouldn't

56
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,800
keep them

57
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
in his office.

58
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,680
He has a study at home.

59
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,720
That's our

60
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,960
closest lead.

61
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,200
I'll check there,

62
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,760
and come back to meet up with you.

63
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,520
You came

64
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,600
to tell me

65
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
you're continuing the investigation?

66
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,320
Yes.

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,720
Mr. Peng's is just a theoryã€‚

68
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,240
I need to see the evidence with my eyes.

69
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,800
Unless I see proof

70
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
of their transaction,

71
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
I...

72
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,040
Do you understand

73
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,680
what smuggling

74
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,600
military supplies

75
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,760
means for us and Japan?

76
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,240
Like tungsten ore.

77
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,840
It's a vital material

78
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
for military manufacturing.

79
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,680
China has abundant tungsten ore,

80
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,360
whereas Japan has very little.

81
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Japan's involvement in such smuggling

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
not only weakens our military capabilities

83
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,880
but also aids

84
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,840
their own struggling

85
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,880
military industries.

86
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,000
That's killing two birds with one stone,

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
feeding the enemy.

88
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,960
Even if my brother isn't a soldier,

89
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,240
he would clearly understand this.

90
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,200
I can't bring myself to believe

91
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,400
he's doing this.

92
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,000
But tungsten mines

93
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
are regulated

94
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
by our military departments.

95
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,280
Without official involvement

96
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,600
and protection,

97
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,400
it's impossible for these

98
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
to end up on Japanese ships.

99
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,720
Yesterday,

100
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
after I returned from Mr. Peng's place

101
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,200
to the shipyard,

102
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,720
I sat up all night.

103
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,800
I really don't want to believe

104
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
it's true.

105
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,320
Chen Hao,

106
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,760
I know you

107
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,280
just want to be a good cop,

108
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
staying out of politics.

109
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,000
But resisting invasion

110
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
isn't about politics.

111
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,240
This is clear

112
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,640
to all our citizens,

113
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,720
to the Communist Party that issued

114
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,120
the August First Declaration.

115
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
But apparently not

116
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,360
to the government.

117
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,160
No,

118
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,080
they understand.

119
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,120
They just don't want to admit it.

120
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,000
Do you remember

121
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,800
asking me if I knew

122
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,680
someone named

123
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,000
Deng Mingyuan?

124
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,800
You know him?

125
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,560
More than that.

126
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Mr. Deng has been like

127
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,160
a guiding star to me.

128
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,280
5 years ago,

129
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,720
I graduated from the Police Academy

130
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
and moved from a fishing village

131
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,560
to Shanghai, becoming a policeman.

132
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,080
I was full of ambition,

133
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,960
but also deeply disillusioned.

134
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,600
When I was struggling

135
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,240
with whether to continue

136
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,640
being a cop,

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
I met Mr. Deng,

138
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,040
who's then at

139
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,840
Jiangnan Shipyard.

140
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,600
He encouraged you to keep going?

141
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,600
Yes.

142
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,280
Then, I was disheartened

143
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,200
'cause I felt that the Public Security Bureau

144
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,160
weren't filled like the men

145
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,920
I dreamed of as a child.

146
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Mr. Deng always encouraged me

147
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,280
to persevere,

148
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
to continue doing

149
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,160
what I believed was right.

150
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,000
Later, I learned

151
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
he had joined the Communist Party.

152
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Do you know

153
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,160
why he did so?

154
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,680
I asked him back then,

155
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,440
but he didn't tell me.

156
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,040
He said

157
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
smuggling

158
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,320
was akin to committing suicide,

159
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,360
a poison coated with honey.

160
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,160
Consuming more of it

161
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,560
accelerates death,

162
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,280
leading to defeat

163
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
even before the war could do its damage.

164
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,520
The National Government has become

165
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,400
powerless to rectify its roots.

166
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,120
The soldiers following the past premier

167
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,080
on the Northern Expedition

168
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,680
have now become politicians

169
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,080
and financial moguls,

170
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,920
leaving the people in disarray

171
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,400
while officials busy with privatizing

172
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,680
national assets!

173
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,640
It's not a personal tragedy for Chiang,

174
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,840
but for the entire government!

175
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,200
So I understand

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
why Mr. Deng

177
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,080
joined the Communist Party.

178
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,680
Because he and his comrades

179
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,560
wanted to build a new world.

180
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,040
Chen Hao...

181
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,600
I know

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,480
you're wondering

183
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,320
about my relationship with the Party.

184
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
I'm just a small-time cop,

185
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,720
merely touched

186
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,040
by Mr. Deng's

187
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,240
guiding light.

188
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,600
When are you returning to Nanjing?

189
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,480
The day after tomorrow,

190
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,480
the 30th of this month.

191
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,480
Alright.

192
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
If there's any news,

193
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,040
call at 57331

194
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,080
at 10 p.m.

195
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,240
It's the number

196
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,480
for the phone booth near my house.

197
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
I'll be there waiting for you.

198
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,560
Okay.

199
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,640
If not convenient, it's fine.

200
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,400
I'll continue the investigation in Shanghai.

201
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,400
After all, he's your family.

202
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,240
Nothing inconvenient.

203
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Just wait for my call.

204
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,720
Alright.

205
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,280
We're here.

206
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,960
This is the last one

207
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,160
of the 3 safe houses

208
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,520
of the NSO

209
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,120
in the French Concession.

210
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,840
Sir,

211
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
we're from

212
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
the beer company.

213
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,720
We've launched

214
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,200
several new products

215
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,080
and are looking for more customers.

216
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,240
If we manage to sell,

217
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,080
there would be a commission for you too.

218
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,840
Would it be

219
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,360
possible to see

220
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
your tenant information?

221
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,080
Just a moment.

222
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,320
Sure.

223
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
The registration

224
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,520
here isn't complete.

225
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,960
Thank you.

226
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,680
You might want to check

227
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,640
with the housing agency.

228
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,040
Do you often

229
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,480
have many residents here?

230
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,200
It's alight.

231
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,280
Not bad.

232
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,160
See,

233
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
I also brought some flyers.

234
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,000
Since people come and go,

235
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,080
do us a favor for promotion.

236
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
No problem.

237
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,920
Thank you.

238
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,280
Don't mention it.

239
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,080
Thank you for your work.

240
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,400
Receiving your warning this morning,

241
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,440
I immediately

242
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,480
met with the leaders

243
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,280
of the NSO.

244
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,640
They also noticed

245
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,920
some unusual activities recently.

246
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,680
The NSO has rented rooms

247
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,560
in several apartments

248
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,800
as safe houses

249
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,000
and even paid the porters

250
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,240
to alert them

251
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,680
if anyone inquires

252
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,720
about them.

253
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,520
Over the past two days,

254
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,280
porters from

255
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,560
three buildings

256
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
reported inquiries

257
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
about landlord information,

258
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,920
including the one for

259
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,880
Mr. and Mrs. Peng.

260
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,960
Do you know by whom?

261
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Ever since the Japanese military exerted pressure,

262
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,760
secret controls on the NSO

263
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,880
have been increasing.

264
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,920
Could be by Shanghai Garrison Command

265
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,720
or the Secret Service

266
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,920
of the Reviving Society.

267
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,400
How are they

268
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
getting the information?

269
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,040
Questioning porters

270
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,080
or

271
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,880
checking with housing agencies.

272
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,280
I'll take some actions.

273
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
We might get the names

274
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,880
through the Police Service's connections

275
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,120
with the housing agencies.

276
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,560
Immediately contact the NSO

277
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,480
to move Mr. and Mrs. Peng

278
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,360
to a new location.

279
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,160
Okay.

280
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,920
Jianshi once said

281
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,600
our team's task

282
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,920
was to work with the NSO.

283
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,720
If we can

284
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,640
help expose Mr. Peng's situation

285
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,800
and the secrets

286
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,360
they discovered,

287
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,560
it could not only alert the public

288
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,680
and deter the National Government

289
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,240
but also help us

290
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,960
achieve the united front's goals faster.

291
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,600
However, we can't

292
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,760
fully expose it

293
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,400
with just a few of us

294
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,720
and the NSO.

295
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,720
Now I have a plan.

296
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,920
I'd like to propose to the higher-ups.

297
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
What's the plan?

298
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,920
I want to organize

299
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,560
a major rally

300
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,920
at Shanghai Customs District

301
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,960
to force an

302
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,480
inspection of Nakamura Naoki's ships

303
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,440
and delay the smuggling of goods.

304
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,800
Additionally, by rallying

305
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,680
public opinion,

306
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,760
the larger the impact, the better.

307
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,080
If your plan

308
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,280
goes without a hitch,

309
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,360
then Mr. Peng and his wife

310
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,520
become crucial witnesses.

311
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,440
That is why their safety

312
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,280
is paramount.

313
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,680
How are you holding up?

314
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,200
I've seen scout cars

315
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,720
searching for signals

316
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
on the streets at night.

317
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,400
Yes.

318
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
I previously reduced the radio's power

319
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,880
from 100 watts to 50,

320
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,760
and recently from 50 to 15.

321
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,920
15 watts...

322
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,560
With such a weak signal,

323
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,400
can you still make contact?

324
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,320
I used to

325
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,480
start working after the neighbors

326
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,680
went to bed.

327
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,960
Now I begin even later,

328
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,480
from midnight to four in the morning.

329
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,760
We'll have to

330
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,400
split into three groups now.

331
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Be sure to keep yourself safe.

332
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,960
Let's go.

333
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
Mrs. Ji,

334
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,760
I'm truly grateful for your care

335
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,400
during this time.

336
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,280
We are all members of the NSO.

337
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,040
It's natural for us to look out for each other.

338
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Take good care.

339
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,720
Is there a problem with this woman?

340
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,480
Nothing.

341
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,240
Is this also an NSO house?

342
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,240
Yes.

343
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,160
I found from the agency

344
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,760
that the tenant of this room

345
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,520
and one

346
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,200
of the names

347
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,920
on my NSO list

348
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,960
are brothers.

349
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,400
I knew this building

350
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,680
had their safe house.

351
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
Now I'm sure

352
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,920
this room

353
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,880
is it.

354
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,800
Using the same method,

355
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,440
I found two other safe houses

356
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,200
in two other buildings

357
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,520
in the French Concession.

358
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Someone

359
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,960
was here before.

360
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,880
Are those two rooms

361
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,560
also needs monitoring?

362
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,400
Absolutely.

363
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,680
Since Hua Zhen rescued

364
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,840
someone from the NSO,

365
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
it's very likely

366
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,960
they would use

367
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,120
these safe houses.

368
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,280
Have someone watch them,

369
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,440
and alert me immediately if anyone enters.

370
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,720
Mr. Wei,

371
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,960
aren't we casting

372
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,680
our net too wide?

373
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
Not at all!

374
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,480
You have to trust me,

375
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,160
I've been battling the Communists

376
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,480
for six to seven years.

377
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
You brought me in for this job,

378
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,120
and you need to trust my instinct.

379
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,240
We are

380
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,720
getting closer.

381
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,680
What's the matter?

382
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,480
Something's off.

383
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,720
For the woman

384
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,320
we just saw,

385
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere.

386
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,280
Recently?

387
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,920
Must have been.

388
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,920
Think about where you've been frequently

389
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,880
before coming to the Special Service.

390
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,560
The tailor's.

391
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,000
I saw her

392
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,960
at the tailor's shop.

393
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,560
Sir,

394
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,400
may I ask

395
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
if a woman

396
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
wearing a hat and a scarf

397
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,160
just came out of here,

398
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,560
about this tall?

399
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,120
Should be.

400
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,640
Are you sure

401
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,720
she came out

402
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,640
of this apartment building?

403
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
As a doorman,

404
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,240
I watch

405
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,120
people coming

406
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,680
and going all day.

407
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,960
She seemed

408
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,080
to be with

409
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,800
two other people.

410
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,560
Which room does she live in?

411
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
I don't know that.

412
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,040
It's her.

413
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,480
I remembered correctly.

414
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,160
I knew

415
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,320
Zhang Runjin's Communist associates

416
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,360
were around this area.

417
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
I saw her before.

418
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,000
Now she's showing up

419
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,040
near an NSO safe house.

420
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,560
That can't be a coincidence.

421
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,320
Should we bring her in for questioning?

422
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,240
Of course not.

423
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,440
She's just a lead.

424
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,040
Our real target

425
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,280
is to draw out Hua Zhen.

426
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,400
Be patient.

427
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,880
We still have a lot of work to do,

428
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,080
but we are getting closer.

429
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,840
Dad,

430
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,520
another day is coming.

431
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,680
I need to go to Wusong Port.

432
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,520
Don't ask me about business.

433
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,760
Just handle it yourself.

434
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,440
Okay, I got it.

435
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,760
I'm heading out.

436
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,640
Did your brother's trip

437
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,280
to Shanghai go smoothly?

438
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,040
It did.

439
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,440
Is the guy who arrested him

440
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,800
still causing trouble?

441
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,160
You mean Wei Daiqing?

442
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,800
He's been fired.

443
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,000
Don't worry,

444
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,080
I've handled all his troubles

445
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,920
in Shanghai.

446
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
I just heard

447
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,760
you tell your dad

448
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,360
that you've arranged everything.

449
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,560
What's that?

450
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,800
Don't worry about it.

451
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,640
Rest assured,

452
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll handle it.

453
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,080
Liang,

454
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,880
you know

455
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,160
I've always

456
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,760
felt guilty about your brother.

457
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,800
You're

458
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
raised by

459
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,040
your dad and me,

460
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,400
but Zhen wasn't.

461
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,080
You only bring us good news

462
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,600
about him

463
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,880
and I don't ask much.

464
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,480
But

465
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,560
no matter what happens,

466
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,080
remember,

467
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,440
you're brothers.

468
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Mom. Don't worry,

469
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
as long as he has no ties

470
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,800
to the Communists,

471
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,480
no one dares touch him.

472
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,480
Young Master is back.

473
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,960
Here,

474
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,960
have some soup

475
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,400
while it's still hot.

476
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,840
What brought you back so suddenly?

477
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,880
School gave us a break,

478
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,760
so I thought

479
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,800
I'd come to see you all.

480
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,440
Where's my brother?

481
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,440
He's not in Nanjing,

482
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,760
left for Shanghai

483
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,800
yesterday.

484
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,240
Need him for something?

485
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,600
I wanted him

486
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,240
to bring me a record

487
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,480
from Shanghai.

488
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,400
Which hotel he's staying at?

489
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
I'll call him.

490
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,520
He's gone

491
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,400
to the Wusong Port freight terminal,

492
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,200
not staying in the city.

493
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Drink your soup before it gets cold.

494
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,000
Alright.

495
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,320
Young Master,

496
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,480
do you need the study of Mr. Hua Liang?

497
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
I'll read for a while.

498
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,160
You can come in and clean later.

499
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,840
Okay.

500
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
May 1st,

501
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,400
196,000 yuan;

502
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,960
July 1st,

503
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,120
130,000 yuan;

504
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,000
September 1st,

505
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,080
139,000 yuan;

506
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,280
November 1st,

507
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,320
123,000 yuan;

508
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,000
February 1st,

509
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,960
162,000 yuan;

510
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,240
May... July...

511
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,960
September... November...

512
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,160
Hello,

513
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,680
this is Chen Hao.

514
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,680
I looked at my brother's ledger.

515
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,680
Every two months on the first,

516
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,880
he receives

517
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
a large deposit.

518
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,880
Following this pattern,

519
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
the next payment

520
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
should be tomorrow.

521
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,240
He's now at Wusong Port.

522
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,000
I suspect

523
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,120
it's related to

524
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,000
what Mr. Peng mentioned.

525
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
I checked with the shipping company.

526
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,600
The Shinei Maru,

527
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,160
the Japanese cargo ship

528
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,920
Mr. Peng photographed

529
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,680
at Shiliupu Wharf,

530
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,600
is scheduled to dock there

531
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,360
on the sixth of next month.

532
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,240
Payment on the first,

533
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
shipment on the sixth,

534
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,560
the timing matches perfectly.

535
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,680
I've requested leave from school.

536
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,120
I'll head to Wusong Port tomorrow.

537
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,360
Okay,

538
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,440
be careful.

539
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,640
I often look back when I'm abroad,

540
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,400
intending to return

541
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,880
once my duty is fulfilled.

542
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,600
But with the nation in such disarray,

543
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,600
my homeland no longer feels the same.

544
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,240
I deeply understand what all this

545
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,520
means for my family,

546
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,400
but how can one support

547
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,560
a falling nation alone?

548
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,280
With the national crisis at hand,

549
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,160
some people are arresting

550
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,640
patriots who resist invasion

551
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,600
while simultaneously smuggling

552
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,520
military supplies to the enemy.

553
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,600
Who is truly saving the nation,

554
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,960
and who is harming it?

555
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,520
A week ago,

556
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,600
Japan pressured Shanghai

557
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,240
to dissolve the NSO.

558
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,320
So, your most

559
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,200
important task now

560
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,640
is to find concrete evidence

561
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,920
proving that the 3 people in the photo

562
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,400
were smuggling military supplies.

563
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,360
I'll report our current findings

564
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,440
to the organization immediately.

565
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,520
I plan to continue investigating

566
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,720
at the Customs District.

567
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,800
Also,

568
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,520
Xiang Yuansheng has decided

569
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,640
to pursue his inquiries.

570
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,120
He's already

571
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
departed to Wusongkou,

572
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,720
where he believes Hua Liang

573
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
will engage in new transactions.

574
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,600
Xiang Yuansheng

575
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,960
wanna continue investigating?

576
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,960
I thought he might stop,

577
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,200
given it's his family involved.

578
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,720
But he's adamant.

579
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,160
He argues that resisting invasion

580
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,120
shouldn't be politicized,

581
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,640
and he's aware

582
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,800
of our August First Declaration.

583
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,960
After issued,

584
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,280
it resonated deeply

585
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,680
within the KMT controlled area,

586
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,600
receiving support from all walks

587
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,200
on halting the civil war

588
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,480
and uniting together.

589
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,600
If we can

590
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,920
expose this smuggling case,

591
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,480
it could greatly influence the movement

592
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,560
to save the nation.

593
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,360
He knows that,

594
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,720
and that's why

595
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,120
he made his decision.

596
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,200
My superiors tasked me

597
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,440
to observe if Xiang Yuansheng

598
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,560
could potentially join us

599
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,440
as a comrade,

600
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,520
and I've already made my decision.

601
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,360
If I am

602
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,520
but a spark,

603
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
he could be

604
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,640
a blazing bonfire.

605
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,320
If he shows

606
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,360
willingness now,

607
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,440
I'll immediately propose to the leadership

608
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,960
to recruit him.

609
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,280
You want to encourage him

610
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,040
in this way?

611
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,720
Exactly.

612
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,200
The situation now

613
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,560
is devastating

614
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,720
for him.

615
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,680
Just as Mr. Deng

616
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,360
once guided me with his light,

617
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,560
I hope

618
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,120
to offer him some hope

619
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,680
during his darkest moments.

620
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,000
I will report

621
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,400
your observations of him.

622
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,680
Moreover,

623
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,040
I've always felt

624
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,400
that Mr. Deng and we

625
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,960
are idealists

626
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,160
in a sense.

627
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,120
It's difficult for one

628
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,640
to persevere through the darkest times

629
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,480
when the organization

630
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,040
is shattered

631
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,960
and all are scattered.

632
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Mr. Deng recruited you,

633
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,680
not just as an encouragement

634
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,880
from one idealist

635
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,600
to another

636
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,440
but because you're trustworthy.

637
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,920
As an underground intelligence officer,

638
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,920
your skills may not be the best,

639
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,640
but the flame

640
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,240
of idealism in your heart

641
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,440
has never extinguished.

642
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,160
That's what truly matters.

643
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,040
Yu, wait up,

644
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,720
I'll come with you to the warehouse.

645
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,760
With the heavy rain and your injured hand,

646
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,960
you should stay home.

647
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,280
I'll clean up and be right back.

648
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,560
I know you're scared of walking alone

649
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,720
at night,

650
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,400
and I also want

651
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,720
to get familiar with the warehouse.

652
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,920
Let me come with you.

653
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,920
What's the rush?

654
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,680
We still have to wait for the goods

655
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
from Jinshanwei

656
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,520
before discussing the warehouse

657
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
with the manager.

658
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,960
If I get to know

659
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,160
the warehouse earlier,

660
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,200
I can make

661
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,720
a good impression.

662
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,360
I really want

663
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,880
to secure this job,

664
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,720
otherwise everyone

665
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,920
keeps worrying about me,

666
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,960
is it?

667
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,840
Alright,

668
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,920
let's go.

669
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,840
Lock the door.

670
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,920
Is Mr. Xu not around?

671
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,880
The window under his control

672
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,400
wasn't closed.

673
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,600
He's on vacation.

674
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,520
Someone rented

675
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,400
that warehouse,

676
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,120
with their own manager brought in.

677
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,520
So the manager told Mr. Xu

678
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,120
to stay away for a while.

679
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,640
Okay,

680
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,280
after we finish up here,

681
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,120
let's close it up for him.

682
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,520
We owe our jobs

683
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
at the docks

684
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,120
to Mr. Xu's introduction.

685
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,760
If his goods get wet,

686
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,120
they'll dock his pay, right?

687
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,920
Right.

688
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,520
With it raining this hard,

689
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,560
the goods inside must be getting damaged.

690
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,040
Anybody there?

691
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
Hello?

692
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,760
Is someone here?

693
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,400
Wait here a minute.

694
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,560
I'll go up and check.

695
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,520
Be careful.

696
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,560
Don't worry, leave it to me.

697
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,680
I can handle it.

698
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,760
Take it slow.

699
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,680
Careful!

700
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,160
It's okay.

701
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,400
Just a box fell.

702
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,960
Really, be careful.
