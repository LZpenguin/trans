3
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,280
Hua Zhen?

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,720
Did he come from Nanjing

5
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,760
to Shanghai?

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,480
Miss Shi,

7
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,200
how did you know?

10008
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,120
Zhang,

9
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,160
could you wait for me downstairs for a moment?

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,400
Miss Shi,

11
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
take a look at my homework.

12
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
I didn't expect

13
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
you'd assign homework to Duoci.

14
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,640
I finish it on time every day.

15
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,120
Officer Xiang,

16
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,160
you already know

17
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,280
I'm an inspector.

18
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,640
I'm also

19
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,040
a friend of Mr. and Mrs. Meng,

20
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,000
and Duoci's French teacher.

21
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
I wasn't in Shanghai when Duoci's parents

22
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,600
had the accident.

23
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Thank you for taking her in.

24
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
Now that I'm back,

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
Duoci is safe with me

26
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,560
and you may return to Nanjing

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,920
and your life.

28
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,000
She paid me for a month

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
to find the killer for her.

30
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
So I won't leave.

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
Besides, I don't trust you enough

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,880
to leave her with you.

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Actually, this was also

34
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,280
a request from Duoci's parents before they died.

35
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,120
Mr. and Mrs. Meng hoped

36
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,520
that, if they

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,160
couldn't take care of Duoci,

38
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
I would take her to Hong Kong

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,080
to continue her life.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,040
I respect her own will.

41
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,200
But if she doesn't want to go,

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,360
you can't

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
take her away.

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Officer Xiang,

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,640
I know many of

46
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,840
Mr. and Mrs. Meng's friends, too.

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,280
Can you tell me

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,640
who asked you to bring this book

49
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
to Shanghai?

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Miss Shi,

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,280
you're just her French teacher.

52
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,120
Aren't you

53
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
being a bit too nosy?

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm also an inspector

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,640
with the Concession Municipal Council.

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
The victims

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,400
were my friends

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,920
and important taxpayers

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,960
of the French Concession.

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,840
Personally and officially,

61
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
I am very concerned about this case.

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,920
I came to the council for

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,320
the Meng family's case.

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,920
But business is business.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,600
That doesn't mean

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,520
I'll exchange

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,280
personal favors.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,280
And,

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
Duoci now goes by Qiushi,

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,480
Li Qiushi,

71
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,040
so don't get it wrong.

72
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,680
Duoci,

73
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,400
are you sure not to go with me?

74
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,320
Miss Shi,

75
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
let me stay for one more month.

76
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
After that,

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,960
when Yuansheng goes back to Nanjing,

78
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
I'll follow you to Hong Kong.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,400
But can he

80
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,920
take good care of you in this month?

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,760
He has been

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
taking very good care of me.

83
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,840
Looks like

84
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,920
I'll have to start calling you Li Qiushi from now on.

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't welcome any visitors

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,720
who come by like you again,

87
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,320
and I hope

88
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,640
this is the last time you follow me.

89
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,640
Sorry about today,

90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,720
but I think

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,640
we both want

92
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,320
to protect Qiushi.

93
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,720
And I've already

94
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,480
requested the Police Service

95
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,920
to drop the complaint against The Fourth Station House.

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,800
They agreed so.

97
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,640
With the complaint gone,

98
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,400
their penalties

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
will be lifted, too.

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,880
Since Qiushi wants to stay,

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
please take good

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
care of her.

103
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,440
She's not coming with us?

104
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,640
She wants to stay.

105
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,760
I'm worried that forcing her

106
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,640
might cause trouble.

10107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Zhang,

108
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,880
rent a house nearby

109
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
to keep an eye on things here

110
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,360
and ensure her safety.

111
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,240
Understood.

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,520
Like this,

113
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,040
got it?

114
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
Got it.

115
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,160
Hello?

116
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,320
I'll be back within a month,

117
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,640
no matter what.

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,640
Brother, is everything alright back home?

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
I'm calling

120
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,680
because everyone at home

121
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,560
was called in

122
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
by the Party Investigation Dept.

123
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,000
for questioning.

124
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
[They didn't even]

125
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
[spare our servants.]

126
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,600
[They've sent someone]

127
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,880
[to Shanghai for you.]

128
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,920
[Get ready to be scrutinized.]

129
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,960
[You've had private dealings]

130
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,040
[with Deng Mingyuan.]

131
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,080
[Just answer their questions.]

132
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,800
[Don't elaborate.]

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,480
[Unless they find something concrete,]

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,760
[they shouldn't hassle]

135
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,680
[our family.]

136
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,800
[Come in.]

137
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,880
Deng Mingyuan sent you a book.

138
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,000
Right.

139
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,000
Which book?

10140
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,560
Die entscheidenden Momente der Menschheit.

10141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
The Decisive Moments of Humanity.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
He gave you a gift,

143
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,200
yet he didn't also ask you for a favor?

144
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,240
What kind of favor?

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,880
Like, helping him leave Nanjing

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,040
or come to Shanghai

147
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,320
to handle things.

148
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,880
No.

149
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,440
Then why did you suddenly show up in Shanghai?

150
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
The military academy rarely gives us breaks.

151
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
I wanted to explore Shanghai during my time off.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,440
[You were alone with Deng Mingyuan in the study.]

153
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,720
[Did you talk about]

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
[anything other than]

155
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,560
[naval books?]

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,320
No.

157
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,040
Think hard.

158
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,680
Don't leave anything out.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,480
I did ask him

160
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,880
about something.

161
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,800
What's that?

162
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,560
In 1924,

163
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,400
the former Premier traveled north

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,760
on the Yongfeng-class Gunboat from Guangzhou,

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,000
and Deng was the Second Mate.

166
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,120
I asked him

167
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,920
what food the Premier liked

168
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,000
aboard the ship.

169
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,800
Does that count?

170
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,120
Mr. Hua.

171
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,000
Mr. Hua,

172
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,480
my name is Zheng Yudong,

173
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,200
formerly with the Ministry of Military Affairs' Navy Dept.

174
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,480
Your family took good care of me

175
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,880
while I was there.

176
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,360
So, I'll just

177
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,760
want to tell you that

178
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,680
you're young.

179
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,240
Make sure you keep a clear line

180
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
between you and Deng Mingyuan

181
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,640
and his associates.

182
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,680
You're from the Navy Dept.,

183
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,760
surely you

184
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,800
know Mr. Deng

185
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,160
better than

186
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,360
my family, right?

187
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Qiushi,

188
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm back with breakfast.

189
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,800
Qiushi?

190
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm here.

191
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,240
What's up?

192
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,680
Yuansheng,

193
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,440
can you braid my hair?

194
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,800
Me?

195
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,800
Yeah.

196
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm not as good as you.

197
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
No worries, let's just eat then.

198
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,400
Does it have to be a braid?

199
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,640
Mom used to braid it for me.

200
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,240
I think braids are pretty.

201
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,960
Let's eat first.

202
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
After we're done,

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,120
I'll take you somewhere.

204
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,240
Luo...

205
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,960
Yuansheng,

206
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,640
are we in the wrong place?

207
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
What do you need?

208
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,880
Officer Luo,

209
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,240
sorry to bother you.

210
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,480
I need your advice on something.

211
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Luo Minmin,

212
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,680
you're stealing my hot water again!

213
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,120
What's it to you?

214
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,920
I boiled this water!

215
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,000
You're not even working!

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,120
Who says I'm not working?

217
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,160
Dad!

218
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,680
Luo Minmin is going to hit me!

219
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm telling you,

220
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,840
you're just spoiled.

221
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
Disrespectful!

222
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,600
Say it. What do you want?

223
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,440
Miss,

224
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,080
can you braid hair?

225
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,320
Braid hair?

226
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,360
Of course, I can.

227
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
My sister wants her hair braided,

228
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
but I can't do it.

229
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,120
I couldn't find

230
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,160
anyone else in Shanghai

231
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,120
to help.

232
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,880
Officer Luo,

233
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,120
could you braid her hair

234
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,360
neatly for her?

235
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
Officer Xiang,

236
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,560
it's nine in the morning.

237
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,840
If you weren't out there arresting people in the French Concession,

238
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,240
I would be at the Fourth Station

239
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,600
doing my job as a cop,

240
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,160
not here fighting over

241
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,480
hot water with my sister.

242
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,360
Besides,

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,320
we're not even close,

244
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,960
but your sister...

245
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
she does

246
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,960
have big eyes.

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,360
Come on in.

248
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Luo Minmin is stealing my hot water again!

249
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,680
And she even threw a slipper at me!

250
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,440
Aren't you going to do something?

251
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,880
Your sister just got suspended.

252
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
Don't provoke her.

253
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,680
Be nice.

254
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,720
Dad!

255
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
My friend is here!

256
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,360
Coming!

257
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,240
This is Officer Xiang,

258
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,080
my colleague from the Fourth Station House.

259
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,240
Officer Xiang, this is my father,

260
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,840
and this is my sister.

261
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,720
I'm Luo Qinqin,

10262
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,600
the first "qin" for diligent, and the second for celery.

263
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,640
Sorry to disturb you.

264
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,360
Not at all.

265
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,400
Welcome.

266
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm back.

267
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,880
Do we have guests?

268
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,360
This is my brother, Luo Tianxiang.

269
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,120
And this is Officer Xiang.

270
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,880
Officer Xiang.

271
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,720
Alright,

272
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,880
I'll take you upstairs, okay?

273
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,240
Wait here for me.

274
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
Go clean the fish.

275
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
I'll cook it in a bit.

276
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
Officer Xiang,

277
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
please, have a seat.

278
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,440
I'll go check on my sister.

279
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,440
Sit.

280
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,960
Split it into three parts,

281
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,080
then move the right strand to the center,

282
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,600
and then the left to the center,

283
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,560
keep repeating, just keep repeating.

284
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,720
You keep doing that until the end.

285
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,040
Didn't your mom

286
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,600
braid your hair when you were at home?

287
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,240
My parents

288
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
aren't in Shanghai.

289
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,080
That's okay.

290
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,320
Look at my sister.

291
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,800
I taught her

292
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,440
how to braid from a young age,

293
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,480
and she picked it up right away.

294
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,120
You're smart.

295
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,920
You'll learn how.

296
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
Thank you, sister.

297
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,680
I'll head downstairs.

298
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,960
Look at her,

299
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,320
all grown up but still acts

300
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,040
like a little kid.

301
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,640
You and my daughter

302
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,960
work at the Fourth Station House?

303
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,480
Yes.

304
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,920
What's your name?

305
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,840
Xiang Yuansheng.

306
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,960
And how old?

307
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,680
Married yet?

308
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,840
Dad,

309
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,160
he's our guest.

310
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,080
Can't I even talk now?

311
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
If personal questions are off-limits,

312
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,720
I'll stick to work-related ones.

313
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
Are you the boss over there?

314
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,360
No,

315
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,800
I'm just another new officer,

316
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,440
like Luo.

317
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,240
What do you need my daughter for?

318
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,240
It's actually my sister who needed

319
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,440
Officer Luo's help.

320
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,560
Sorry to bother you.

321
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,680
No problem at all.

322
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,560
As long as it's not about work,

323
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,360
you're not bothering us.

324
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,840
Heard you all got penalized?

325
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,800
Does that mean you can't be cops anymore?

326
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,840
The decision isn't final yet.

327
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,560
But it looks like we might not be suspended.

328
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,440
What?

329
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Not suspended?

330
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,040
So,

331
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,080
you're always hanging around with Xiang Yuansheng?

332
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,840
He's my cousin.

333
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,720
Can he take good care of a kid?

334
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,720
Absolutely.

335
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
All done with the braid.

336
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,480
Let me check.

337
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,560
It looks beautiful!

338
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,080
Why are these sleeves so big?

339
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,360
Who bought you this outfit?

340
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,960
Yuansheng.

341
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,200
Wait,

342
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,320
why isn't there a penalty anymore?

343
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
Weren't you supposed to get punished?

344
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,320
What happened to that?

345
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,440
You know, you cops

346
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,080
never keep your word.

347
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,080
Who's sticking their nose where it doesn't belong?

348
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,720
It's so irritating!

349
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,800
Dad, why are you bringing this up?

350
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,680
Come with me for a second.

351
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,440
What kind of brother are you?

352
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,960
What did I do wrong?

353
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,560
Her parents aren't around,

354
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,960
and as her brother,

355
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,320
you should be properly looking after her.

356
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,720
How can you take care of her

357
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
if you know nothing?

358
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,320
Because I can't braid hair?

359
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,080
Obviously not.

360
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,560
Is it because she's

361
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,440
not eating right,

362
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,600
or not drinking enough milk?

363
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,920
Do you think you're raising a kitten?

364
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,200
She said

365
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,520
her parents have gone far away,

366
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,880
and now it's just her with you,

367
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,360
right?

368
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,680
Right.

369
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,280
So she won't see

370
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,680
her parents

371
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
for a long time?

372
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:04,920
Right.

373
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,480
She's sad

374
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,920
not because

375
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,360
she can't braid her hair.

376
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,040
At this age, girls start

377
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,640
to care about

378
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
looking nice,

379
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,040
but it's because...

380
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,360
other girls

381
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
have their moms to braid their hair

382
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,760
for them,

383
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,480
and she misses her parents.

384
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,320
If her parents

385
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,680
aren't around in the future,

386
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
especially her mom,

387
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,800
you're going to encounter

388
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,520
a lot of challenges caring for her.

389
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,880
If you really want

390
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
to look after her well,

391
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,120
you need to be attentive.

392
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,720
Pay close attention.

393
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,720
How do you know all this?

394
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,440
My sister was four

395
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,720
when our mom got sick and died.

396
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I was eight that year.

397
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,400
So, I know.

398
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,920
Did you get

399
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,440
all that?

400
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,480
Now I do.

401
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,120
It doesn't help much

402
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,760
if you're dressing her in clothes

403
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,280
that don't fit.

404
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,400
Can't believe

405
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
you aced two of your exams.

406
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
She's still practicing her braiding.

407
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,720
Just sit here and wait,

408
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,200
so my dad

409
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,440
doesn't start on you again.

410
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,720
Sit down.

411
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,960
Sit tight here,

412
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,720
don't touch anything,

413
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,880
don't mess around,

414
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,720
and don't talk to anyone.

415
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,760
Got it?

416
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,760
Got it.

417
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,880
Didn't I tell you not to stare?

418
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,760
Dad, didn't you say

419
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,720
you put it away?

420
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,120
Why is it out again?

421
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,440
I thought you liked this one.

422
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,680
All set now.

423
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,120
Three...

424
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,120
two...

425
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,840
wait, hold on a second...

426
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,760
Wait a moment.

427
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,240
One.

428
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,960
So beautiful.

429
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,760
That's the deal.

430
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,040
Brother.

431
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,680
Look.

432
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,360
I can braid my own hair.

433
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,920
From now on,

434
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,520
I can braid my own hair.

435
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,720
Your sister is smart.

436
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,200
Like my sister Luo Qinqin,

437
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,320
she's a quick learner.

438
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,520
Ms. Luo,

439
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,200
thank you.

440
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,280
Let's go.

441
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,280
All right.

442
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,520
I'll walk you out.

443
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,480
[Qinqin, I don't have enough eggs.]

444
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,800
[Get two more for me.]

445
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
[Brother, take it yourself.]

446
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,680
[I'm busy peeling garlic.]

447
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,120
[I don't have time for that.]

448
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
[It's just peeling garlic.]

449
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,040
[Nonsense.]

450
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,440
Do you have food at home?

451
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,560
We'll go to a restaurant.

452
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
Goodbye

453
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,800
Wait a minute.

454
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,320
Do you want to eat vegetable congee?

455
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,840
What is that?

456
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,120
It's a kind of congee.

457
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,200
It has soup, vegetables, and rice in it.

458
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,920
It's hot and soft.

459
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,680
My brother and dad

460
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,000
make delicious vegetable congee.

461
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
I want you to eat with us,

462
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,720
OK?

463
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,480
OK.

464
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
Thank you, sister.

465
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
If you're alone

466
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,800
and have nowhere to go,

467
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,040
come join us.

468
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,240
Do I have to hold your hand, too?

469
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
Thank you, sister.

470
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,360
You are welcome.

471
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,520
Mr. Xiang,

472
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,880
has anyone said

473
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,560
you look like

474
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,760
a movie star?

475
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,760
No.

476
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,840
The movie star...

477
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,040
Wait a minute.

478
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
Mr. Xiang, pardon her.

479
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,240
That's how my sister is.

480
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,280
[I got it.]

481
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,040
Clark Gable.

482
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,400
Check this out.

483
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,480
Does he look like your brother?

484
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,880
My brother looks way better than him.

485
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,760
No way.

486
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,320
Check it out.

487
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,880
Come on.

488
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,840
They look nothing alike.

489
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
No way.

490
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,680
Look at his eyes.

491
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,280
His nose.

492
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,840
His mouth.

493
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,800
And his temperament.

494
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,760
Aren't they exactly the same?

495
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,480
Sit down. Don't be silly.

496
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,320
Come on.

497
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,680
[Did you attend the accounting class]

498
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,600
[I signed up for you?]

499
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
[I did.]

500
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,320
[But I don't understand the lesson.]

501
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,080
What's the teacher's last name?

502
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,360
I don't know.

503
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,160
You've taken a class.

504
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,840
But you don't know

505
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,800
the teacher's name.

506
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,680
He said his name. But I forgot it.

507
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,320
When I came out of the class,

508
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,560
I saw a fish seller there.

509
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,600
The fish was big and fresh.

510
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
So I bought one.

511
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,320
This is it.

512
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,720
My lesson is not in vain, anyway.

513
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,840
Brother, good for you.

514
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,600
Let's eat.

515
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,040
Help yourself.

516
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,320
The fish looks delicious.

517
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:19,920
Here.

518
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,480
Let me serve you some.

519
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,960
Have a piece without bones.

520
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
Have some cauliflower.

521
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,800
Is it salty?

522
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,840
No.

523
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,760
That's good.

524
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,280
Do you like

525
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,800
my brother's cooking?

526
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,320
Yes.

527
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,840
Let's eat.

528
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,120
Come on.

529
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,960
[It's not bad.]

530
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
What's your name?

531
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,240
My name is Li Qiushi.

532
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,880
What grade are you in?

533
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,360
Second grade.

534
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,520
At this age,

535
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,600
you should study hard.

536
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,520
What about you?

537
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,680
Did you ever go to school?

538
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,360
Yes.

539
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,200
Elementary school or junior high school?

540
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,800
Both.

541
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,440
Well,

542
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,440
did your parents want you to be a police officer?

543
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,040
They don't know I'm a policeman.

544
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,080
You kids

545
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,800
all make parents worry.

546
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,520
How can you hide it from your parents

547
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,000
that you are a policeman?

548
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Dad, how can you

549
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,080
lecture our guest?

550
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Because he is just like you,

551
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
worrying his parents.

552
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,080
Well...

553
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,800
These are the eggs

554
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,880
I bought this morning.

555
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
Only this little girl

556
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,080
is good.

557
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,320
That doesn't stop you

558
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,360
from loving your children.

559
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,320
I didn't say that.

560
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,400
Did I?

561
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,080
I didn't.

562
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,880
You don't have to tell us.

563
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,600
Right, Luo Minmin?

564
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,400
Luo Minmin?

565
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,800
Don't you dare call me by my name.

566
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Call me Sister.

567
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,320
Names

568
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,360
are meant to be called.

569
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,200
I want to call you Luo Minmin.

570
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,080
Luo Minmin.

571
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Don't you dare stand up.

572
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,720
How dare you?

573
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,280
What can you do about it?

574
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,960
You are disrespectful little thing.

575
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,800
This is my home too.

576
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,480
Why can't I call you by name?

577
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,240
How dare you bang on the table?

578
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,960
Do you want to be beaten?

579
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,560
Do you still want to eat?

580
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,040
What's wrong with you?

581
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,960
Do you want to hit me again?

582
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,520
Who hit you?

583
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,280
You are done.

584
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,600
I tell you.

585
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,400
I won't let you eat.

586
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,520
Enough.

587
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,560
Enough.

588
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,120
There are so many dishes.

589
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,600
Why can't you eat in peace?

590
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,720
He meant you.

591
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,640
He meant you.

592
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,360
Sit down.

593
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,160
Caution.

594
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,880
Make room for me.

595
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,040
It's hot.

596
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,120
Here comes the vegetable congee.

597
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,640
This is the vegetable congee.

598
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,760
Come on, have a taste.

599
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,560
Thank you, sir.

600
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,040
Mr. Xiang,

601
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,800
let me serve you a bowl.

602
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,520
Thanks.

603
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,880
What do you want to say?

604
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,640
Serve me a bowl.

605
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,560
Don't you have hands?

606
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,360
Do it.

607
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,080
Do it yourself.

608
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,720
Serve me a bowl.

609
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,800
You serve her a bowl.

610
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I'll do it.

611
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,840
What a troublemaker.

612
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,480
How could take to the street?

613
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
Didn't you know how worried dad was?

614
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,520
If you get caught,

615
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,480
what do we do?

616
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,640
Dad didn't want you to be a policewoman.

617
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,400
But you became a police anyway.

618
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,280
Why didn't you listen to dad?

619
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,960
I became a policewoman...

620
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,840
What did I become a policewoman for?

621
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,240
It's all about

622
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,880
protecting our family.

623
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,560
Don't give me big words.

624
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,800
You always have a point.

625
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,320
That's because I have a point.

626
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,600
That's what you think.

627
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,160
You still want to talk.

628
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,320
Why can't I...

629
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,480
Why can't I talk?

630
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,080
You went to an accounting class,

631
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,840
ending up buying a fish home,

632
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,400
Is it reasonable?

633
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,280
If I didn't buy that fish,

634
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,640
what would you eat today?

635
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,400
These are the clothes

636
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,320
I wore when I was a kid.

637
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,320
These fit Qiushi.

638
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,120
Those clothes you gave her

639
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,080
are too big for her.

640
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,600
You also have moments

641
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
acting up like a child.

642
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,520
Qiushi,

643
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,920
I probably won't be

644
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,760
a policewoman anymore.

645
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,560
But if there's anything

646
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,160
you don't understand,

647
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,280
come to me at this photo shop.

648
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,960
OK?

649
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,520
I got it, sister.

650
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,240
Thank you.

651
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,560
Ms. Luo,

652
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,280
thank your family for your hospitality.

653
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
Don't worry. You will not be suspended.

654
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,240
The problems of the Fourth Station House,

655
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,080
it will be solved.

656
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,080
Remember to drink the milk before sleep.

657
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,520
Ms. Minmin asked me

658
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,800
to give you this.

659
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,040
This is the money for that day's mission.

660
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,000
She told me not to take it out

661
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,560
before you get home.

662
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,720
In case you refuse to take it.

663
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,600
Brother,

664
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,560
did you treat Ms. Minmin

665
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,800
to chocolate cake?

666
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,560
It's our mission.

667
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,520
Check this out.

668
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,720
Mission funding.

669
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,080
Brother,

670
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,280
I like Ms. Minmin

671
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,400
and her family.

672
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,280
Do you like her?

673
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,520
Go to bed.

674
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,080
Brother,

675
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,240
I don't want to sleep.

676
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,800
I don't want to sleep.

677
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,400
Be good. Sleep.

678
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,280
[Ms. Luo,]

679
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,480
[Don't worry. You will not be suspended.]

680

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,400
[Please come in.]

683
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,840
Do you want to see me?

684
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,720
Are you Deng Mingyuan's contact

685
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,040
in Mukden?

686
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,040
Yes.

687
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,040
Do you know this guy?

688
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,960
Take a close look.

689
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,760
Do you know the person

690
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,520
in this photo?

691
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,160
No.

692
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,720
Didn't Deng Mingyuan

693
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,400
ask you to contact this guy?

694
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,760
No.

695
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,360
What is

696
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,920
Deng Mingyuan's plan?

697
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,920
All I know is that

698
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,480
he was going to help

699
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
the Mengs leave Shanghai.

00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
Are you talking about the Mengs

701
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,000
who were killed?

702
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,560
I've seen them

703
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,280
in Mukden before.

704
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,000
I heard they were all dead.

705
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,000
No.

706
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,600
There's a girl

707
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,360
who probably isn't dead.

708
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,160
Was it Deng Mingyuan's man

709
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,120
who saved her?

710
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,920
Have you ever seen that man?

711
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
What's his name?

712
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,920
Is he still in Shanghai?

713
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
The task leader

714
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,520
arranged a man

715
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,320
to protect them.

716
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,960
But I don't know who they are.

717
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,560
The leader

718
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,480
never tells me things like that.

719
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,160
Give it to me.

720
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,160
[Captain,]

721
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
[we've looked into it.]

722
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,040
[In the past year,]

723
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,160
[the closest person to the Mengs family]

724
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,600
[was Meng Duoci's French teacher.]

725
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
[She is an inspector]

726
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,440
[of the Concession Municipal Council.]

727
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,280
[Her name is Shi Junyu.]

728
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,360
Mrs. Ji.

729
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,960
Ms. Shi, here you are.

730
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,680
[Who saved Duoci?]

731
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,560
[Duoci said his name was Hua Zhen.]

732
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,480
[He's from Nanjing.]

733
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,560
[He's the son of]

734
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,720
[Undersecretary Hua Zhuoqin.]

735
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,720
Mr. Deng entrusted him with the ticket.

736
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,960
At least,

737
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,040
that means he's trustworthy.

738
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,440
Judging by his identity,

739
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,560
he is probably not our comrade.

740
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,640
But he is staying in Shanghai

741
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,760
not only to take care of Duoci

742
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,440
but also to find the murderer for her.

743
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,440
It doesn't seem like something

744
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,200
an outsider would do.

745
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,960
I don't know

746
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
who he is.

747
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,440
Maybe only Group Leader Deng

748
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
knows who he is.

749
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,200
Half a month ago,

750
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,840
when Leader Deng sensed

751
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,360
that Duoci's parents were in danger,

752
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,320
he had already begun to

753
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,440
arrange their evacuation.

754
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,680
But he didn't expect

755
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,280
he was late.

756
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,240
It has something to do with the Japanese.

757
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,320
Leader Deng has been helping

758
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,280
the Patriotic Chamber of Commerce

759
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,680
chaired by Duoci's parents

760
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,280
to deliver supplies to the northern front.

761
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,840
It was not until a year ago

762
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,000
that our organization in Shanghai

763
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,400
was completely destroyed,

764
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,880
and the Japanese kept sending spies

765
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,040
from the north to Shanghai

766
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,480
to search for those involved in the plan.

767
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,480
That is why ISKRA was abolished.

768
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,280
I suspect that the Japanese

769
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,160
are not just targeting

770
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,200
Duoci's parents.

771
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,480
Regardless of

772
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,720
Hua Zhen's background,

773
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,720
when it comes to finding the murderer,

774
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,560
his goal is the same as ours.

775
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,360
In the notorious Purge a year ago,

776
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,800
we lost all of

777
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,840
our operators and interpreters.

778
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,440
You were

779
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,560
the best telegrapher.

780
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,440
But now,

781
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,200
you're part of action team.

782
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,520
Leader Deng

783
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,080
used to joke

784
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,680
that we are short of talent.

785
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,520
We go wherever we are needed.

786
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,520
I'm trying to fix

787
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,480
the telegraph transmitter

788
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
he risked his life to protect.

789
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,240
We don't have a telegraph transmitter.

790
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,080
But I'm working on the radio.

791
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,120
I am ready

792
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,480
to be a telegrapher at any time.

793
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,920
Unless the organization tell me to,

794
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,720
I'll go wherever I'm needed.

795
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,560
Leader Deng was arrested.

796
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,600
There are only three people left

797
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,040
in our group, you, me,

798
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,080
and Zhang.

799
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,920
Tread carefully.

800
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,360
With the identity of an inspector

801
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,400
as disguise,

802
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
I can move freely.

803
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,080
Don't worry.

804
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,720
This is the office of the Police Service

805
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,040
of the Concession Municipal Council.

806
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,760
This is Shi Junyu.

807
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,200
[We found the traitor in Mukden.]

808
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,040
Don't move.

809
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,400
Get down.

810
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,000
Don't move.

811
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,600
Don't move.

812
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,280
Get down. Don't move.

813
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,040
Inspector Shi,

814
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,040
the director said

815
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,560
he wanted to take your car

816
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,200
back to the Concession Municipal Council.

817
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,640
Noted.

818
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,360
Thanks. Are you going in?

819
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
I'll gas up the car and be right back.

820
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,120
OK.

821
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Inspector Shi.

822
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,160
You must be Inspector Shi, Miss Shi.

823
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,440
May I have your name?

824
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,320
Nice to meet you.

825
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,240
I am Wei Daiqing.

826
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm the head of the investigation team

827
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,040
of Shanghai Garrison Command.

828
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,280
Sorry to bother you.

829
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
I have something to ask you.

830
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,680
I'm sorry.

831
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,920
It's not a good time.

832
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,720
Let's take a rain check.

833
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,880
I only have a few questions.

834
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,720
If it is really inconvenient for you,

835
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,840
we can talk here.

836
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,440
It won't take long.

837
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,280
It's our first meeting.

838
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,920
Don't you think it's too abrupt,

839
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,160
Mr. Wei?

840
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,720
Agreed.

841
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,680
I'm here for the Mengs murder case.

842
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,960
I found out

843
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,640
that Miss Shi is

844
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,960
Miss Meng Duoci's French teacher.

845
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,760
I think

846
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
maybe you're

847
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,960
more concerned about

848
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,840
Miss Meng Duoci's safety than I am.
