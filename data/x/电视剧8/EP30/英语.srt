00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,200
Shooting Stars EP30

3
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Feng Sir.

4
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,760
Feng Sir?

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
I have always distrusted Chen Hao.

6
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,080
He looks obedient,

7
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,480
but you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,720
He's been in cahoots with Xiang Yuansheng

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,880
since their time at the Fourth Station.

10
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,840
They've had it in for me for quite some time.

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,720
Are you sure you didn't see

12
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,680
who got shot?

13
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,200
I didn't.

14
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,240
Luo Minmin was unconscious.

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,080
It must be either Chen Hao or Hua Zhen.

16
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
What if

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
it was Hua Zhen?

18
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,080
He's the son

19
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
of the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Military Affairs.

20
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,320
If he's the one injured...

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,040
Now you're wiser.

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
Do I need you to tell me that?

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,320
Why don't you dispose

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,000
Tian Dongbao's body?

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,720
What the hell use are you to me?

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,480
My fault, Feng Sir. My mistake.

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Now that they know,

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,720
The thing will come to light.

29
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,720
I need to find someone

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
to pin the murder charge on.

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
So, you want to

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
frame one of those three?

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
That's the easiest solution.

34
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,560
We need a perpetrator for the case.

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
Issuing a warrant

36
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,360
will keep them tied up.

37
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,200
But we can't issue it against Hua Zhen.

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,720
His family would give me trouble.

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,960
It has to be Chen Hao.

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,120
Arrange an eyewitness.

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,200
Understood.

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,040
I'll put San on that,

43
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,640
and he will be an eyewitness.

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,680
And, Feng Sir,

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
what evidence should we prepare?

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,400
Anything will do.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,040
In this case,

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,080
what I say happened,

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
happened.

50
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
The only person

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,880
who could blow this wide open

52
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,760
is Hua Zhen.

53
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
What do we do then?

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
Find him and that woman,

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,240
and terminate both.

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,360
Got it.

57
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
Feng Sir,

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,840
this is the forensic report

59
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,080
for the deceased from San Yang Fisheries.

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,640
The body shows multiple external injuries

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,200
and signs of being beaten before death,

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,680
but the cause of death was hypothermia.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,480
Hypothermia?

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
Why did I receive

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
a call this morning

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,600
reporting a shooting?

67
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,200
A shooting?

68
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,040
That's...

69
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
Moreover, the caller claimed

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,000
the murderer

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,480
was one of our own,

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Chen Hao!

73
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
Chen Hao?

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
How could it be Chen Hao?

75
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,680
He claimed to have witnessed

76
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,800
the entire murder process!

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,880
Why would he?

78
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,840
Why don't you investigate?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,040
Where is Chen Hao now?

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
He hasn't shown up this morning.

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
Killed someone and now he's too scared to show up.

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,400
Issue a warrant for his arrest.

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,400
Yes Sir.

84
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,680
Inspector Shi,

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
this is a request for assistance

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,680
in a murder case from the Public Security Bureau,

87
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,640
sent to us for action.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
The Director instructed me

89
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,600
to hand it to you

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
for distribution to the patrol houses.

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,120
When was this received?

92
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,800
Just now.

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,200
They've also requested

94
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,000
permission for police to enter

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,080
the French Concession to apprehend the suspect,

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
as the fugitive

97
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
is a police officer

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,280
and considered dangerous.

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,680
The Director has already approved it.

100
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Alright, I got it.

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll distribute it to the patrol houses shortly.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,480
Yes, madam.

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,760
Captain has a fever.

104
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,000
His wound is infected.

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Where is your watch?

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,560
I sold it.

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,400
We need to go into town.

108
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,360
I had the pharmacist

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,240
to buy some sulfanilamide powder.

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
We need it to fight the infection.

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,600
Newspapers!

112
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,440
Newspapers for sale!

113
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Newspapers!

114
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Get your newspapers!

115
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,480
Newspapers!

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,000
That's Feng Guangyun.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Feng Sir.

118
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
We can't go to that pharmacy now.

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,840
What do we do?

120
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,760
Where else can we go?

121
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,960
Let's try the medical facility at Jiangnan Shipyard.

122
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,400
Although I'm

123
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
off duty now,

124
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
it's our only option.

125
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,680
Feng Sir,

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,480
he was spotted buying sulfanilamide powder

127
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,760
in the black market.

128
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,360
Someone traded this

129
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,280
for sulfanilamide powder?

130
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,240
Yes.

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,120
The watch seemed quite valuable,

132
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,000
so I agreed.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Was it this person?

134
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,040
No.

135
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,280
Came alone?

136
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,880
Yes,

137
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,640
a young man,

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
in his twenties,

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,960
decent-looking.

140
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,400
What else did he buy from you?

141
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,680
Frostbite medicine, alcohol,

142
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,160
gauze, bandages,

143
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,800
all for disinfection purposes.

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,520
Uh,

145
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,000
and he also

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
traded for a blanket

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
and some food.

148
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
Chen Hao was the one

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,480
shot at San Yang Fisheries.

150
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,040
Immediately notify all cooperating departments

151
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,280
and checkpoint police

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,160
to be on the lookout

153
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
for a suspect with a gunshot wound.

154
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,160
Yes Sir.

155
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,240
Follow me.

156
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,640
Sir, please show me your ID.

157
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,320
Second Lieutenant,

158
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,880
who's in the back seat?

159
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,520
He's my friend.

160
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,520
Please wait a moment.

161
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,520
Don't move!

162
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,080
Stop right there!

163
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,120
No?

164
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,960
No, I don't.

165
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,120
You,

166
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
do you have a sister?

167
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,240
Yes.

168
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,720
Is your sister named Luo Minmin?

169
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,640
Yes.

170
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,080
Was she with the Fourth Station?

171
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,720
Listen,

172
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,960
don't try to deceive me.

173
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,800
Your sister

174
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
is connected to this person.

175
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,680
If you don't

176
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
confess,

177
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,560
we can shut down your shop

178
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,960
and arrest you

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,880
for prison, believe it or not?

180
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
They've actually traced it here.

181
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,760
Feng Guangyun knows

182
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,320
we need

183
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,480
supplies and medicine,

184
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,280
anticipating we'd come to your place.

185
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,560
He's trying

186
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,640
to block every way

187
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,280
we might seek help.

188
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,560
I haven't seen him.

189
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,960
Really?

190
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
What crime did he commit?

191
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,520
What crime?

192
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
He's connected

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,560
to a murder case.

194
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,600
If you're worried,

195
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
I can try to get you home

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,280
after dark.

197
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,800
It's okay.

198
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,600
Let's go.

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,400
Have you seen this man?

200
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,160
Is that the inspector

201
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,480
from the French Concession?

202
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,680
Seems like her.

203
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,480
Quick, notify Mr. Wei!

204
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,880
Later,

205
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,840
we need to take measurements again...

206
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,480
Mrs. Ji.

207
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,400
Please have a seat.

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,040
Okay.

209
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,240
My suit

210
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,160
need a bit of adjustment.

211
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,320
Can you check it for me?

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,640
Right this way, please.

213
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,480
What's the rush?

214
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Is something wrong?

215
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
Chen Hao is wanted.

216
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
I just received a request for assistance

217
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,280
in apprehension from Shiliupu Police Station,

218
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,960
stating the suspect

219
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,920
has a gunshot wound.

220
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
He's been shot.

221
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
What's he wanted for?

222
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Murder,

223
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,000
just like Mr. Peng.

224
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,600
It's Feng Guangyun's

225
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,400
usual tactic.

226
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
Have you tried contacting Chen Hao?

227
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,120
Can't reach him.

228
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,200
He didn't show up

229
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,520
for the French class last night,

230
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
and the last time I saw him

231
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,160
he was going

232
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,040
to continue investigating

233
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,880
the military supplies smuggling case.

234
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,920
He mentioned that Xiang Yuansheng would join him.

235
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,840
It seems something unexpected

236
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,080
happened during their investigation.

237
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,200
What about Xiang Yuansheng,

238
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,520
can you reach him?

239
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,600
No contact with him either.

240
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,000
Chen Hao managed to escape despite being shot

241
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,360
I guess, because he was

242
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,120
with Xiang Yuansheng.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,560
From the details of the warrant,

244
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,560
it seems Chen Hao's identity

245
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,400
hasn't been compromised.

246
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,200
Otherwise, Feng Guangyun could have

247
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
arrested him under the pretext of

248
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,960
apprehending a communist,

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
instead of fabricating

250
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,920
a murder charge.

251
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,120
If Chen Hao's identity is still secure,

252
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,160
then the investigation into the smuggling case

253
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,560
is just between him

254
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,280
and Feng Guangyun,

255
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
which means there's still a chance.

256
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,640
But that's just me

257
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,760
being optimistic.

258
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
Junyu,

259
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,840
leave the clothes with me.

260
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,760
Remember,

261
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,720
you came here

262
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
because the sleeves of this garment

263
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,960
are too large,

264
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,480
and you needed a tailor for the adjustment.

265
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
What you need to do now

266
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,840
is go straight back to the Council

267
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
and protect yourself,

268
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,520
as you are likely the only one

269
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
they might turn to for help,

270
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
and possibly

271
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
their last resort.

272
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,920
Where's the owner?

273
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,880
She seems to be...

274
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,480
Anyone here?

275
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,640
Owner!

276
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,840
Owner!

277
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,280
Ms. Shi, what do you think of it?

278
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,920
I think the sleeves

279
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,520
are still a bit too large.

280
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,400
Could you adjust them again?

281
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Ms. Shi?

282
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,600
Inspector Shi!

283
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,680
Long time no see.

284
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,880
You are?

285
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,000
It's Daiqing.

286
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,520
Wei Daiqing,

287
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,360
the former head of the investigation team

288
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
at the Shanghai Garrison Command.

289
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,280
I accompanied you

290
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,880
to buy flowers last time.

291
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,240
Captain Wei, sorry,

292
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,280
I didn't recognize you.

293
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,600
It's okay.

294
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm no longer the head

295
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,560
of the investigation team.

296
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,040
I've left the Shanghai Garrison Command.

297
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,080
So, what brings Mr. Wei here today?

298
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,920
Well,

299
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,640
just wandering around.

300
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,200
Didn't expect

301
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,280
to bump into you here, Ms. Shi.

302
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,320
You might be disappointed then.

303
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,200
Mrs. Ji

304
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,160
only makes women's clothing.

305
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,080
I...

306
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,160
Ms. Shi,

307
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,600
is this gentleman a friend of yours?

308
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,520
Yes.

309
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,360
No,

310
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,280
just had some

311
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,960
official interactions.

312
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,040
Ms. Shi is frequent client.

313
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,000
I usually

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,200
don't make men's clothing.

315
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,360
However, I do know a tailor

316
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,000
who is very skilled in men's apparel.

317
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,160
I could refer him to you.

318
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,880
No rush.

319
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,880
Actually, I was

320
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,280
just strolling today.

321
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,960
Didn't expect

322
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,360
to see her here.

323
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
Mrs. Ji, please help me

324
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,600
adjust the sleeves.

325
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,400
I'll be leaving now.

326
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
I'll let you know when it's done.

327
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,640
Okay.

328
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,400
Enjoy your browsing. I'll be leaving now.

329
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,920
I won't linger either.

330
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,720
I should get going.

331
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,160
Take care.

332
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,320
Ms. Shi,

333
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,200
are you heading back to the Council?

334
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,160
Yes.

335
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,560
Great.

336
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,400
I drove here.

337
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,640
My car is

338
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,920
just down the street.

339
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,480
I can give you a ride.

340
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,840
Thank you for that.

341
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,920
This way.

342
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
The tailor shop

343
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
is quite a distance

344
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,160
from the Council,

345
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,920
Ms. Shi.

346
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
It's not that far,

347
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,520
just a half-hour walk.

348
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
You often go there, Ms. Shi?

349
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,280
I'll pick up a garment in two days,

350
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,520
and I sometimes

351
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,960
check out new fabrics.

352
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
I will never have too many clothes.

353
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,800
Ms. Shi,

354
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,360
I hear women

355
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,160
prefer to shop in groups.

356
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,800
How come you're alone?

357
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,360
Many French female staff at the Council

358
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,880
like to have their clothes made there.

359
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,160
They're particularly interested in cheongsams.

360
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,000
I came to know about it

361
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,800
through their recommendations.

362
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,720
Mr. Wei,

363
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,240
you're not offering me a ride

364
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,040
just to investigate something about me, are you?

365
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,200
I wouldn't dare.

366
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
Ms. Shi, you may not know,

367
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,200
but I'm no longer

368
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
working at the investigation team.

369
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,640
You sure don't sound like it.

370
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,480
My apologies.

371
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,760
Probably an old habit

372
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,840
of mine,

373
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,960
or perhaps

374
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
it's Ms. Shi's charm,

375
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
making me babble.

376
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,800
To be honest, Ms. Shi,

10377
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
I've secured a job within your French Concession.

378
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I've got another job

379
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,960
and quitted the tough job

380
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,080
in the investigation team any more.

381
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,120
Where did you work?

382
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,520
AG Brewery.

383
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,200
I work as a buyer.

384
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
The welfare of the company

385
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,560
is really nice.

386
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,600
On joining the company,

387
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,880
they bought a car for you.

388
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,040
If I didn't work in the Council

389
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,320
I should join the company, too.

390
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
You must be kidding.

391
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,640
Ms. Shi,

392
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,480
It's a waste of talent.

393
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,160
You

394
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,920
work in such a high position

395
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,800
in the Council.

396
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,120
It's an amazing achievement

397
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,200
for a Chinese

398
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,680
and a female.

399
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,240
Your leader

400
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,400
wouldn't let you go.

401
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,440
I can work in the Council

402
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,320
not solely because of

403
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,720
my talents.

404
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,600
My parents have a longstanding friendship

405
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
with Director Faber's family,

406
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,840
which is why

407
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,640
I was able to firmly secure

408
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,840
the position of Inspector.

409
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,200
Generally,

410
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,600
people wouldn't dare to bother me.

411
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,120
Ms. Shi.

412
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,360
how well

413
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,240
do you know Mrs. Ji?

414
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,440
Very well.

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,440
What's wrong?

416
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,320
Wonderful.

417
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,560
My mother's birthday is coming up

418
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,200
a few days later.

419
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,360
and I would really love to

420
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,840
get her a cheongsam.

421
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,760
I'll need to

422
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,040
impose on Mrs. Ji's expertise.

423
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,440
Mr. Wei,

424
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Mrs. Ji's workmanship

425
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,720
surely

426
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,040
won't let you down.

427
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,520
Thank you.

428
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,240
Ms. Shi.

429
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Ms. Shi.

430
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,720
I realize

431
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,960
I may have been quite thoughtless

432
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
with my words on the road earlier,

433
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,720
which might have seemed rather forward.

434
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,960
Well,

435
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,640
I apologize for it.

436
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,080
When might you have some free time

437
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,400
Ms. Shi?

438
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,280
I would be honored

439
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,960
if you would let me

440
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,840
buy you a beer.

441
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Thank you for the ride.

442
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
Did anyone call me

443
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,600
when I've been gone?

444
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,560
No calls, inspector.

445
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,440
Noted, thank you.

446
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
I've been driving it for the last two days,

447
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,320
which may have caused overheated water tank.

448
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
We have no choice but to wait it out.

449
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,840
Captain,

450
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,080
how do you feel?

451
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,480
Captain,

452
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,600
we didn't find

453
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,240
a proper hospital.

454
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,360
We'll take you

455
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
as soon as

456
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,840
it gets light.

457
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
Today,

458
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,080
I heard about the wanted order.

459
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,720
We can't go to hospitals or clinics

460
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,800
for the time being.

461
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,520
And we can't stay in hotels or inns either.

462
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Once the car is fixed,

463
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,120
we'll have to return to

464
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,000
where we were yesterday.

465
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,760
I'll figure this out tomorrow.

466
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,240
If we can't buy sulfanilamide in the clinic,

467
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,920
I'll go to the black market.

468
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,240
There is always a way.

469
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,280
What did you find out

470
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,880
in Wusong Port?

471
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,440
A batch of goods of Nakamura Naoki

472
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,200
will arrive at the Shiliupu Wharf on 6th this month.

473
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
He's worried about

474
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
further complications if delayed.

475
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,680
So, he wants to ship the goods

476
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,560
to Japan as soon as possible.

477
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,920
Tan Shiyuan promised him

478
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,200
to help them pass Shanghai Customs District.

479
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,600
The 6th.

480
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,000
We have four days to stop the shipment of the goods

481
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
before the delivery date.

482
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,760
Before that,

483
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,160
I must get you well again.

484
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,240
OK.

485
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,800
The captain is still running a fever.

486
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:18,960
Well,

487
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,880
I'll get a wet towel.

488
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,720
Here you are.

489
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank you.

490
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,640
Help me out of the car.

491
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,200
You are weak.

492
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,640
You need a rest.

493
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm feeling stifled in the car

494
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,520
and just want to step out for some fresh air.

495
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,960
I fear I won't

496
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,000
have another chance

497
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,440
to do so.

498
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,920
Why did you rescue us yesterday?

499
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,360
Do you realize the consequences?

500
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,720
You may never be able to r

501
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,760
return to the precinct

502
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,320
or work as a police officer again.

503
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,840
I know that.

504
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Then why?

505
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,480
You're wanted city-wide.

506
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,360
Unless the warrant is withdrawn,

507
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,440
you'll be forced to

508
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,760
live in constant hiding.

509
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,960
Aren't you in the same position?

510
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,080
If you were me,

511
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,480
what would you choose to do?

512
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,280
I don't know

513
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,320
if I even I have a choice.

514
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,320
But when I saw my brother was dealing

515
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,120
with Nakamura Naoki in Wusong Port.

516
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,520
I realized that

517
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,560
my family is involved, too.

518
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,440
I couldn't convince myself that

519
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,320
I have nothing to do with it.

520
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
My name is Hua Zhen.

521
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,760
I've been proud of that

522
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,040
my name is Hua Zhen in the past 20 years.

523
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,400
I believed I

524
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
had everything I wanted

525
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,520
I thought that

526
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,600
every decision I'd made

527
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,640
was right.

528
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,200
But when I look back now,

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,920
I don't think

530
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,320
I've ever truly known myself.

531
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,120
Many people

532
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,920
come to the end of their lives

533
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,160
still strangers to themselves.

534
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,560
Keep doing things

535
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,360
which you think right.

536
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
That was what Mr. Deng said.

537
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,080
It is Deng Mingyuan,

538
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,280
a CPC member,

539
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,760
who lit my way

540
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,120
with his stars when I was in despair.

541
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,120
Weren't you also guided by him?

542
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,720
Since I was twelve,

543
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Mr. Deng's words have inspired me.

544
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,240
"Life or death,"

545
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,800
"I will do whatever I can for the benefits of the country"

546
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,400
If you understand this sentiment,

547
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,760
you'll understand my choice.

548
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,120
These are the last words

549
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,440
Mr. Deng left to me.

550
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,160
But now, I'm not sure

551
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,040
if it's too late for me

552
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,200
to choose anew.

553
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,200
For anyone,

554
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,440
as long as the direction is correct, it is never too late.

555
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,640
I want to become a person

556
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
like Deng Mingyuan.

557
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,200
We will become a person

558
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,560
like him.

559
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,200
We will.

560
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,520
Take this.

561
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,440
Seize the moment

562
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,720
and steer us toward survival.

563
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,760
We'll stay alive.

564
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,840
We will.

565
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,840
OK.

566
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,960
You should have a rest.

567
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's dark outside.

568
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
Can we find a way back?

569
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,200
Yes, we will.

570
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,960
We must find it.

571
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,840
Come in, please

572
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,240
Ms. Shi,

573
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
why haven't you gone home yet?

574
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,720
I have some matters

575
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,600
to attend to.

576
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,080
We're about to turn off the power.

577
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,160
Do you need us to leave it on for you?

578
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,520
Please keep it on for now, thank you.

579
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,160
OK.

580
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,000
Recounter.

581
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,000
Recounter.

582
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,280
Recounter.

583
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,200
Recounter.

584
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Did you sleep well?

585
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,840
Didn't you stay up all night long?

586
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,400
Let's check Chen Hao.

587
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,200
Chen Hao.

588
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,880
Chen Hao.

589
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,080
Chen Hao.

590
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,960
How's Captain?

591
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,840
He had a bad fever.

592
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
You stay with him

593
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,920
and I will buy some sulfanilamide.

594
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,160
There is shrapnel left in his wound.

595
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,000
Sulfanilamide

596
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
can't help anymore.

597
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,040
He needs a surgery immediately.

598
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,640
Then what should we do?

599
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,280
Get on the car.

600
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,160
Is this the place

601
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,040
where reporter Peng works?

602
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,440
Yes.

603
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,400
This place belongs to the NSO.

604
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,480
Feng Guangyun didn't know here.

605
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
We can ask them for help.

606
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,960
Wait for me in the car.

607
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,520
OK.

608
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,520
If I see any police,

609
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,240
I'll drive around.

610
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,760
Take care.

611
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,640
So do you.

612
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,400
This is the general office of

613
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,200
the Council.

614
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,960
I am Shi Junyu.

615
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,920
Ms. Shi,

616
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,360
this is Xiang Yuansheng.

617
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,560
I worked as a police officer

618
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,200
in the Fourth Station House

619
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,240
Maybe you don't remember.

620
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
I met some trouble

621
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,040
I can't find another one

622
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,080
to ask for help

623
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,800
in Shanghai.

624
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,320
So, I have to call you.

625
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,440
Officer Xiang,

626
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,320
I remember you, of course.

627
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,480
Qiushi always mentioned you

628
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
when she called me.

629
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,360
What happened?

630
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,240
A friend of mine was shot.

631
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,000
And he needs to have a surgery now.

632
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,320
But I can't take him to the hospital.

633
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,440
And I can't

634
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,480
tell you the reason.

635
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,880
I can't trust anyone else

636
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,240
except you.

637
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,200
Please help him.

638
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Who is your friend?

639
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,000
He's Chen Hao.

640
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,040
He worked as a police officer of the Fourth Station.

641
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,640
Did he hurt badly?

642
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The wound isn't in the vital organ.

643
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,120
But it turns inflamed.

644
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,440
Xiang

645
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,800
Chen Hao is my student

646
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,920
of French class.

647
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,320
Even though I didn't know you,

648
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,200
I'd help him.

649
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,560
Thank you.

650
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,800
What should I do?

651
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,720
Drive him to the Shengen Book Store

652
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,440
in No. 3, Changle Road.

653
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,160
Come in, please.

654
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,480
Ready? We need to go.

655
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,240
Did the director start off?

656
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,120
Yes.

657
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,280
Nobody is allowed to be absent in this meeting.

658
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,320
Give me 5 minutes on the way.

659
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,360
I have to get a dress

660
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,720
in the tailor's shop.

661
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,480
Let's go.

662
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,520
It's on the way, after all.

663
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,400
Mrs. Wang,

664
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,240
why are you doing the job yourself?

665
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,840
Where's Mr. Wang?

666
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,720
Why doesn't he help you?

667
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,160
He's gone to purchase goods.

668
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,800
A newsstand is opened

669
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,160
besides your store.

670
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,200
He moved here few days before.

671
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,240
But,

672
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,440
he doesn't look like a businessperson.

673
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,320
It doesn't matter.

674
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,840
The more stores in our street

675
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,640
the better.

676
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,920
Indeed.

677
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,360
I got client, Mrs. Wang.

678
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,000
I'll go back now.

679
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,280
OK.

680
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,760
Mrs. Ji.

681
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,320
Ms. Shi, welcome.

682
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,880
Follow me.

683
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,280
OK.

684
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,760
Ms. Shi.

685
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,400
Help yourself, please.

686
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,080
I'll fetch the dress.

687
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,960
OK.

688
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,040
Mrs. Ji,

689
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,960
this is my bill.

690
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,800
Follow me please.

691
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,800
I've fixed the cheongsam

692
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,000
according to your figure

693
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,880
and I've tightened the cuff.

694
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,120
Please check.

695
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,560
OK.

696
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,080
Here.

697
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,840
The cuff looks suitable this time.

698
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,600
After Wei Daiqing left last time,

699
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,640
there're always people

700
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,480
looking out near my shop.

701
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,320
It must be his subordinates.

702
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,160
Be careful when you go.

703
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,560
I've got the information that

704
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,360
the one who is behind the investigation

705
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,320
is Wei Daiqing.

706
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,440
I have contact with

707
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,520
Chen Hao and Xiang Yuansheng.

708
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,520
Chen Hao was shot

709
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,600
and he needs an immediate surgery.

710
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,440
This is sulfanilamide.

711
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,800
I've told Xiang Yuansheng

712
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
to take him to the Shengen Book Store.

713
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,400
OK.

714
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,600
I'll go there right away.

715
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,440
What about the people spying on you?

716
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,600
I can handle it.

717
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,560
Ms. Shi,

718
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,000
How do you like

719
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,320
the length of the cheongsam?

720
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,840
I think it is a little longer.

721
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,640
It may need a trim.

722
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
I'll fix it then.

723
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,480
Thank you.

724
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,560
Junyu, we must hurry up.

725
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,480
Let's go.

726
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,400
Take care.

727
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,320
So do you.

728
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,960
Rubbish collection.

729
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,120
Rubbish collection.

730
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,320
Rubbish collection.

731
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,320
Rubbish collection.

732
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,600
Rubbish collection.

733
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,120
Rubbish collection.

734
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,800
I haven't seen you before.

735
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,960
Are you new here?

736
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,080
Yes.

737
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,360
I've just moved in

738
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,480
and started a small business.

739
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,800
This is my shop.

740
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,240
We can help each other.

741
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,520
Sure.

742
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,960
I'll take out the trash.

743
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,400
Could you please mind the store for me?

744
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,200
If there is a visitor,

745
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,240
just tell him I'll be back soon.

746
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,800
This shop, please.

747
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:47,960
OK.

748
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,640
Thank you.

749
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,120
OK.

750
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,560
Rubbish collection.

751
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,560
Rubbish collection.

752
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,200
Rubbish collection.
