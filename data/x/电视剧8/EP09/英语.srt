Tianxiang.

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,240
Father.

5
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm going to Xiaodongmen.

6
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
You take care of the shop.

7
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
Xiaodongmen.

8
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,760
It's far.

9
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,160
I'll get a rickshaw for you.

10
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,840
No.

11
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,880
Don't waste money.

12
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,120
I'm leaving.

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,840
Take care.

14
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,280
Excuse me.

15
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,240
How much for three people to take a photo?

16
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,240
Coming.

17
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,240
Tianxiang,

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
don't you know

19
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
why we're here?

20
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
I know.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
Hurry up.

22
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,800
I got more.

23
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,920
Give it to me.

24
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
That's all?

25
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,160
Do I look like a fool?

26
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,520
No.

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,960
That's all the money

28
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
I can get

29
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
right now.

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Can I pay back

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,880
the rest of the money by installment?

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,160
That's all the money, huh?

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,360
I see.

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Buddy,

35
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,520
Please don't

36
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,400
touch that.

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,440
Tianxiang,

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
no money and don't touch your things, right?

39
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
Burn down the shop.

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
Please don't. I have money.

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,160
I'll take you to get the money.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,720
I got enough money.

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,520
I'll take you there.

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Please don't.

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,880
I can get money.

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
I'll take you to get the money.

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,080
I'll take you there.

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
He is my friend.

49
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
You don't have to do that.

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Why did you hit him so hard?

51
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,160
Look.

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
I don't think it is too hard.

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,000
Tianxiang,

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,880
I know you are hard up.

55
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
But you were my first employee

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,080
who advanced wages.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
I've been quite fair to you, haven't I?

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,960
But I am

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,360
a businessman.

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,080
You tell me.

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,640
You owe money

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:30,960
and keep delaying payment.

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,640
Don't you think that's a bit indefensible?

64
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,680
Speak up.

65
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,240
Are you going to

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,680
pay me back today?

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,680
Boss,

68
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,520
you showed me a photo

69
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
and said there was a reward

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,360
for finding the girl in the photo.

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
Is the reward still valid?

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,920
You know where that girl is?

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,400
Yes or no?

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,760
Yesterday,

75
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
I ran into the girl

76
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,520
on Wangyun Road.

77
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
That's all

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,520
I know.

79
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
What's the exact address?

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,080
I found the girl named Meng

81
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
for you.

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,400
Yeah.

83
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,520
No. 23, Wangyun Road.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,680
It's an apartment.

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,280
No.

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,840
What about the money?

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,640
No, I'm not asking you to pay it now.

88
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,400
OK.

89
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
That's a deal.

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,120
OK.

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,960
I will hang up.

92
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,400
You shouldn't be here.

93
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,520
You said my word.

94
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
I've resigned.

95
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Then you should stop working the case.

96
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,600
It has nothing to do with you.

97
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm curious

98
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,160
how you can be sure

99
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,520
that the target will see that posting.

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,880
That day, he was

101
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,040
at the Mengs' memorial service.

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,160
I guess he saw the posting

103
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
of the memorial service from newspaper.

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,320
So I suspect

105
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,480
he has the habit of reading newspapers.

106
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
So you're waiting here

107
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,400
to lure him out.

108
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
Are you done asking me questions?

109
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,320
You will get more chance

110
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,280
if we work together on it.

111
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,400
Why do I have to work with you?

112
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,160
Because the target doesn't know me.

113
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,280
We can work together.

114
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
But you have to listen to me.

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,160
No problem.

116
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,480
I'll go first. You go later.

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
I deposited a key

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,840
at the help desk.

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,080
I'll go there to take it.

120
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
You follow my suit.

121
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,240
Do what I...

122
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Hello,

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm here to get the key

124
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Meng Duoci kept here.

125
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,960
OK, please wait a second.

126
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,600
Sir, here you are.

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,680
Thanks.

128
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,600
Gunfire.

129
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,880
Don't move.

130
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,760
Hurry!

131
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,800
Follow that black car ahead.

132
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,440
Captain Chen,

133
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,760
what are you doing here?

134
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
What key is this?

135
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
It's the key of the Fourth Station House.

136
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
The key to your station house?

137
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
How did end up

138
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
at the Jinmen Hotel?

139
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,200
What are you going to do with it?

140
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,880
This is the key to a locker.

141
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,040
Who are you trying to fool

142
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,920
with this key?

143
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,800
Feng Sir,

144
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,880
we intended to lure out

145
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,840
the murderer of

146
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,880
the Mengs homicide case.

147
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,160
Didn't expect to see you here.

148
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
What were you doing at the Jinmen Hotel?

149
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,520
Meng Duoci

150
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,640
has not been found yet.

151
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,760
The station initiated an investigation.

152
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,800
And I'm here, naturally,

153
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,280
to search for her.

154
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,040
To my surprise,

155
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
I saw you and your farcical display.

156
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,760
You still want to fish the murderer out?

157
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,480
Don't you know that the murderer

158
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,400
committed suicide

159
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,640
in fear of sin?

160
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,520
Arrest him.

161
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:35,800
Yes Sir.

162
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,040
Yes Sir.

163
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Did you get the key?

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,840
It was a trap.

165
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,000
Only the girl

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
can open the safe.

167
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
Welcome.

168
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,560
Sir, are you alone?

169
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,920
I'm meeting my friend.

170
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,400
May I

171
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,680
use your bathroom?

172
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,800
Of course.

173
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,920
This way, please.

174
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,480
Excuse me.

175
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,680
Bring me another bottle of sake.

176
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,040
Excuse me.

177
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,400
Sir,

178
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,320
has your friend arrived?

179
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,640
I am sorry.

180
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,400
I may have the wrong address.

181
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,680
I didn't take them with me.

182
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
That doesn't mean you could do it.

183
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
You are representing the Fourth House, yes or no?

184
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,880
Feng Sir said

185
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,040
the case was closed.

186
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
No, you can't meet the Captain.

187
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,400
You've submitted your resignation.

188
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,720
You are not

189
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,680
one of us anymore.

190
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,400
Our case

191
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,440
has nothing to do with you.

192
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,080
Get out of here.

193
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,680
Come with me.

194
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,400
Captain.

195
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,040
Captain.

196
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,560
What the hell?

197
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
He has resigned, why...

198
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,560
Inspector,

199
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,760
it is your call.

200
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,160
The inspector of the Fourth House

201
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,800
has the call.

202
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,400
Fix it yourself if you break it.

203
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,520
You fault, and you!

204
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,800
What's for lunch?

205
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,280
I lost him.

206
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,280
Where did you lose him?

207
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,800
At a Japanese restaurant in Fuqingli.

208
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,360
I saw

209
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,680
a suspect went into the restaurant.

210
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,040
When I got in there,

211
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I didn't find anything.

212
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,040
A Japanese restaurant?

213
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,640
I didn't get a chance to ask you.

214
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,200
How did you know

215
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,760
that the murderer was after a key?

216
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,400
The Mengs had a safe

217
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,160
in the bank.

218
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
I guess the murderer was looking for

219
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,280
the key to the safe.

220
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,160
So I found a substitute.

221
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,560
With the key to the locker?

222
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,680
Yes.

223
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,440
What key is this?

224
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,680
It's the key to a locker of the station house.

225
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
Who are you trying to fool

226
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
with this key?

227
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,440
No wonder

228
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,560
Feng Guangyun's face turned blue

229
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,520
when he saw the key.

230
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,680
How did he know

231
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,920
it was a substitute?

232
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,040
You got me.

233
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
How did he know in the first place

234
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,680
that the murderer was looking for a key?

235
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,760
Captain,

236
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,040
Here's the file of the new recruits

237
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,680
in the Fourth House.

238
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,920
Xiang Yuansheng.

239
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,680
Xiang-Yuan-Sheng.

240
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,640
I'm back.

241
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,400
Dad, you're back.

242
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,520
Let me.

243
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Everything's OK at home?

244
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,440
Yes.

245
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
I tripped

246
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
and fell down.

247
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,400
It was slippery.

248
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm going to send the cake

249
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,920
to the girl.

250
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
Is your sister back?

251
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,400
No.

252
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,880
She should be back

253
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,400
at this time.

254
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,160
Maybe she has a mission.

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
A little girl

256
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
runs back and forth with a group of men.

257
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,440
Well,

258
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,160
when they come back,

259
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,320
have your meal. Don't wait for me.

260
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,000
This is for you.

261
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Put it on.

262
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,960
I just got a call.

263
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,000
Someone found her.

264
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,680
Where is she?

265
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,000
No.23, Wangyun Road.

266
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,480
OK.

267
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,440
Three letters, huh?

268
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,120
Yes, it is.

269
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,440
I got it.

270
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,840
See you.

271
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,320
Take care.

272
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,840
You, too.

273
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,480
Uncle Luo,

274
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,000
Which room?

275
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,840
This way.

276
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,320
I see.

277
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,440
Well.

278
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,720
Uncle Luo,

279
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
what brings you here?

280
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,160
I brought you something nice.

281
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,720
Really?

282
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,640
Check it out.

283
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,880
Look what I brought you.

284
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,000
Stand here.

285
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,720
Is this really for me?

286
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,960
Yes.

287
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
Can I open it now?

288
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,280
Of course.

289
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,440
Really?

290
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,960
I bought it for you

291
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
yesterday.

292
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,040
But

293
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,880
I forgot to give it to you.

294
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,960
It's all right.

295
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
The cake is beautiful.

296
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
It smells great.

297
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,520
Thanks, Uncle Luo.

298
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
You're welcome.

299
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,640
OK, enjoy it.

300
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,280
I'll go back home.

301
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,160
Uncle Luo,

302
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,800
could you

303
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,000
play with me for a while?

304
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,720
I have to go home

305
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,720
to cook for my daughters.

306
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,920
All right.

307
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,200
See you.

308
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,480
See you, Uncle Luo.

309
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,720
See you.

310
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,960
Officer, what can I do for you?

311
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
It's a routine check.

312
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,760
A dozen families

313
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,400
live in the building.

314
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,520
I have all the tenant information kept

315
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,440
in this book.

316
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,280
Did you register every one of them?

317
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,800
Yes, Sir.

318
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,920
I checked their registration cards

319
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,440
according to the PSB regulations.

320
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,600
Is there a girl

321
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,440
at the age of eight years old?

322
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,040
Eight years old?

323
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,480
The first and the last room

324
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,760
on the second floor have little girls.

325
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,320
Officer,

326
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,600
what do you want?

327
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,360
Officer,

328
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,440
what do you want?

329
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,760
Could you tell me first?

330
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,520
I need to check.

331
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,520
The officers in charge of this street know

332
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,680
that the rent here is expensive.

333
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,760
The tenants are decent people.

334
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,720
If you knock on their doors,

335
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,920
I can't explain it.

336
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,760
Hello, Sir.

337
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,840
Hello.

338
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
What can I do for you?

339
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,360
What are you looking at?

340
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,760
He...

341
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,400
He has resigned.

342
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,480
What is there to see?

343
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,520
You can clean up the place

344
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,800
if you don't have anything to do.

345
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,760
OK?

346
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,600
Yes, Sir.

347
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,520
OK.

348
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,520
Hold on.

349
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,520
I'm going to pick up the phone.

350
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,760
Aren't you afraid it's a penalty

351
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,680
falling on us from the top?

352
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,240
The phone is ringing.

353
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,280
It's not polite to keep it ringing.

354
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,800
If you answer it,

355
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,080
we will have trouble.

356
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,280
If you don't answer it,

357
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
we will be free of trouble.

358
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,400
What if there's an emergency?

359
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,760
Come on.

360
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
Don't think so much.

361
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
It's almost time to get off work.

362
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,920
Even if it's an emergency,

363
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,080
we can't help.

364
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,920
Go back and sit tight.

365
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,240
You made me fret.

366
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,000
We ran out of apples.

367
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
I will get a carrot.

368
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Do you want a carrot?

369
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:15,800
No, thank you.

370
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,280
No, thank you.

371
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,640
Minmin.

372
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,480
It was hung up.

373
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,120
Nothing happened.

374
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,720
Nothing happened.

375
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,800
Hi,

376
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,080
this is The Fourth Station House.

377
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,480
I am police officer Luo Minmin.

378
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,880
What can I do for you?

379
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,560
I am Qiushi.

380
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,360
I'm at home.

381
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,720
There's a bad guy

382
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,320
on my doorstep.

383
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,080
Why are you answering?

384
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,400
Why didn't you stop her?

385
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,280
Be quiet.

386
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,240
Qiushi, I heard you.

387
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,840
Now, answer my question

388
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,000
briefly.

389
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,080
Are you safe for now?

390
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
Yes, I am.

391
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,600
How many bad people are there?

392
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,600
One.

393
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,840
He is

394
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,240
the murderer.

395
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,360
It's the murderer of the Mengs' homicide.

396
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,240
Captain,

397
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,880
we have a situation.

398
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,840
What happened?

399
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,600
Yuansheng's sister said

400
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,760
that the murderer was

401
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,840
at her house.

402
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,360
Xiang Yuansheng.

403
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,640
Let's go.

404
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,600
Captain.

405
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Let's go.

406
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,840
[What floor are you on?]

407
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,560
I'm

408
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,600
on the second floor.

409
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,720
We'll be there in a minute.

410
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,640
Remember,

411
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,280
when necessary,

412
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,520
look for an opportunity to escape.

413
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,840
Understand?

414
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,560
I...

415
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,800
I understand.

416
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,200
Sir,

417
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,520
[please drive faster.]

418
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,920
[Sir, faster please.]

419
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
[It's fast enough.]

420
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,240
[I'm at full throttle.]

421
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,480
[We will be there in a minute.]

422
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,800
[I'm on the way.]

423
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,120
[You...]

424
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,840
[Watch out.]

425
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,600
[Move over.]

426
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,880
[Your baton hurt me.]

427
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,560
Officer Xiang,

428
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,840
[Stop crowding, you two.]

429
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,760
[Sir, please...]

430
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,880
[Please drive faster.]

431
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,920
I know who Qiushi is.

432
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
I misjudged you.

433
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,480
You've done

434
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,880
a lot of things that others couldn't.

435
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,480
Let go of me.

436
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,360
No.

437
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Let go.

438
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,160
Let go.

439
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,560
Let go.

440
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,040
Help.

441
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,240
Qiushi, don't be scared.

442
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,480
Follow me.

443
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Qiushi, run.

444
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,800
[Remember,]

445
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,560
[when necessary,]

446
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,520
[look for an opportunity to escape.]

447
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,000
Dongbao. Hongfa.

448
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,640
Guard the door.

449
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,480
Yes, Sir.

450
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,280
Erbai. Dongbao.

451
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,640
Gather information. Search the building.

452
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,200
Officer.

453
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Tell me what you know.

454
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,480
A policeman came to me this afternoon.

455
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,000
He pointed a gun

456
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,680
at me.

457
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
Qiushi.

458
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,880
Qiushi.

459
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,320
Qiushi.

460
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,200
Is she in?

461
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,960
The window.

462
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,440
Captain, we found something.

463
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,080
Here.

464
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,000
Come on.

465
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,440
Here.

466
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,480
He has a knife wound in his leg.

467
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,440
I don't know if he is an accomplice.

468
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,880
It's you.

469
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,880
The murderer is chasing Qiushi.

470
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,000
He has a gun.

471
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,520
Wait.

472
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,000
This is the murderer's dagger.

473
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,520
Send him to the hospital.

474
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,440
We don't know who he is yet.

475
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,320
Dongbao, send him to the hospital.

476
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,960
-The others follow me.
-Yes, Sir.

477
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
Officer Xiang,

478
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,520
What...?

479
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,120
Xiang Yuansheng.

480
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,800
Xiang Yuansheng.

481
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,480
What is Xiang Yuansheng's

482
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,120
sister's name?

483
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,920
Li Qiushi.

484
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,760
Sun Hongfa, you stay.

485
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,400
Blow the whistle if things happen.

486
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,200
The others follow me.

487
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,520
Yes, Sir.

488
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,360
Qiushi.

489
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,600
Qiushi.

490
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,640
Erbai, you go that way.

491
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,280
Yes, Sir.

492
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,760
Captain, what about me?

493
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,640
You stand there.

494
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,120
Where?

495
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,680
Under the streetlight.

496
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,560
Don't run to corners.

497
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,240
Wait for me.

498
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,320
Captain.

499
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,800
Stay safe.

500
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,320
Qiushi.

501
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,520
Excuse me,

502
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:22,960
did you see

503
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,760
a child this tall?

504
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,520
I didn't. Sorry.

505
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,880
Qiushi.

506
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,320
Qiushi.

507
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,600
Careful.

508
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,880
Careful.

509
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,240
Hang in there.

510
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
We are almost there.

511
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,840
Wait for me.

512
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,400
I'll be right back.

513
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,080
I'll go pay.

514
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,600
Thanks.

515
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,760
May I borrow your phone?

516
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,240
Hello.

517
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,400
It's me.

518
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,200
The child is in danger.

519
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,200
Noted.

520
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,960
Stay safe.
