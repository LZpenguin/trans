1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,160
Shooting Stars EP13

3
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,160
Teach him a lesson.

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,000
I want him not to go

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
against me forever.

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,040
Keep him alive or not?

7
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
This is Lanhe Restaurant

8
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,200
who called

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,160
the pawnshop.

10
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
I've been here before.

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Really?

12
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,080
I followed the suspect here

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,640
on the day for the case of Jinmen Hotel.

14
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,960
But I lost him.

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Have a look inside.

16
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
Hello.

17
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
Okay, got it.

18
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,840
Excuse me.

19
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,560
Good afternoon, here is the menu.

20
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,880
Thank you.

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Excuse me.

22
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
A friend of mine

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
has booked a dinner

24
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,440
2 days before.

25
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,720
But he wanna change

26
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,640
one kind of the fish.

27
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,640
I have to inform the waiter.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,000
Which kind do you want?

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,720
I can write it for you.

30
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,360
Replace eel with saury.

31
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,880
Yes.

32
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,080
Saury is okay.

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,840
He has other requirements

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
like persimmon leaves

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,520
in season

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,640
for side dish.

37
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,160
We wanna

38
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,520
confirm with the waiter directly.

39
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,160
Yes.

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,520
For an order 2 days ago,

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,280
Yoshida should be responsible.

42
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,720
But he asked for a leave.

43
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Yoshida?

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,880
Hideo Yoshida.

45
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,640
He's responsible for

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,080
reservation and external contact.

47
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,280
However,

48
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,960
he asked for

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,080
a week's leave

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,280
Do you know where he lives?

51
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,080
Or where else

52
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,640
does he usually go?

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,160
He seems like a student.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,800
But

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
he never speaks of

56
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,840
himself.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
Thank you.

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,080
Will you go home after work?

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,320
No.

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
Why?

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,160
I haven't gone home for days.

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
I have to go back.

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
Textbooks...

64
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,720
Japanese school uniform...

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,160
This logo

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
looks like a school badge.

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
Can you recognize it?

68
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,680
No.

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,360
The button is the same as the one

70
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,280
Minmin picked up.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,560
The murderer...

72
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,720
Welcome.

73
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,560
Sir,

74
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,680
are you dinning alone?

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,440
On the day we handled the Jinmen Hotel case,

76
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,720
Hideo Yoshida

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
probably learned

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
about my apartment

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,560
through the pawnshop's phone

80
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,400
and drove over

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,440
to pick up the killer.

82
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
All our attention

83
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,200
was paid to the police uniform

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,520
worn by the killer,

85
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,880
not to the clothes inside.

86
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
So, the button

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,480
Minmin pulled down should be

88
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,880
from the school uniform inside.

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,680
What we should do next is

90
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,760
to confirm the school which

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,080
the uniform belongs to.

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,480
Are you OK?

93
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,560
Yes.

94
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,440
What about you?

95
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm fine.

96
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,720
Let's leave here first.

97
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
That's all?

98
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,320
Yes.

99
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,880
The wallet might drop

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
when I flung.

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,080
Sir.

102
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,720
A bowl of noodles.

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Only one?

104
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,640
OK.

105
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,400
May I use this?

106
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,280
Sure.

107
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,160
Two bowls, please.

108
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,720
OK.

109
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Do you think that

110
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,440
was a death threat just now?

111
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
As long as

112
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,320
those people think so.

113
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,200
What's your plan next?

114
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Continue investigating.

115
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,880
I won't give up now.

116
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Who do you think

117
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
they're sent by?

118
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,880
Feng Guangyun.

119
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,280
If it's true,

120
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,520
you'll suffer more

121
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,840
than suspension.

122
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
It's the school badge.

123
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
Gosh, you can remember it at a glance.

124
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,640
I'll investigate myself.

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,560
That's obviously

126
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
a Japanese school uniform.

127
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,880
I have

128
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
some friends in the government.

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
They may find the school

130
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,960
from the Education Bureau.

131
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,640
No, it's not working.

132
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,080
No registration is required

133
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,320
for Japanese schools.

134
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,920
They're managed

135
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
by the Japanese Residents' Association.

136
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,840
What is it?

137
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
An autonomous group of expatriates.

138
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,520
We can never get any information

139
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,320
from the group.

140
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,920
I knew

141
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,640
some textile mills for uniforms.

142
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,880
I'll do the investigation.

143
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,640
You're not clear about the conditions here.

144
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Aren't you afraid of being dismissed?

145
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,320
If so,

146
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
I'd already stopped

147
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,960
and wouldn't think of it.

148
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,880
What are you doing?

149
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Eating noodles.

150
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,400
Have I said giving it to you?

151
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,160
You never pay for noodles!

152
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,280
I paid it

153
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,640
just now.

154
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
Protect yourself

155
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,200
before saving others.

156
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm protecting you.

157
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,920
Sir.

158
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,200
Gimme a bowl, please.

159
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,520
No problem.

160
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,240
Put it higher.

161
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,080
Higher.

162
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
No.

163
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,080
Lower.

164
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,880
No, higher.

165
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,720
Higher.

166
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,200
Too much.

167
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,960
Lower.

168
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,080
OK.

169
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,120
Hold on.

170
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
Everybody looks at me.

171
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,040
Smile.

172
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,400
Cheese.

173
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,280
Three, two, one.

174
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,760
Go.

175
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,400
OK.

176
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,640
You're welcome.

178
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,520
We are neighbors.

179
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,160
I didn't expect you

180
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
to have

181
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,800
a son again.

182
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,640
We like more sons.

183
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
Just need to prepare more food.

184
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,880
Indeed.

185
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,920
Mr. Luo,

186
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
when will the photo be ready?

187
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
You can ask Minmin

188
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,320
for it

189
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,160
the day after tomorrow.

190
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,360
Don't worry.

191
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,000
She's been learning to take photos

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,880
from me.

193
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,760
She can run the shop

194
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,120
within half a year.

195
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
Running a photo shop

196
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,120
is suitable for a girl.

197
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,160
It keeps out wind and rain.

198
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,880
Great!

199
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes.

200
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,920
What are you talking about?

201
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,320
Miss Luo

202
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,000
is busy every day.

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,520
Apart from the police work,

204
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,240
she has to run the shop.

205
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,840
Don't you

206
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,480
feel bad for her?

207
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,280
She isn't a police officer anymore.

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,120
Running

209
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
the shop is easier

210
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
than working in the police.

211
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Isn't it?

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
Look at my children.

213
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,040
That's enough.

214
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,760
If I had such a girl...

215
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
They're all good.

216
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
We need to go.

217
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,000
All good.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,480
The day after tomorrow.

219
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,400
I didn’t finish.

220
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,880
The day after tomorrow.

221
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,360
OK.

222
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
I keep it in mind.

223
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,360
Thank you.

224
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,800
Fine.

225
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
See you next time.

226
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,920
Bye.

227
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
See you.

228
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,880
Goodbye.

229
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,400
Remember the date.

230
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,160
Sure.

231
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,400
Don't forget it.

232
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
No problem.

233
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,920
Bye.

234
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Hey girl.

235
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,760
Why do you wanna be a police officer?

236
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
Sir,

237
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,600
because I wanna

238
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,640
protect my family.

239
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
Luo...

240
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,760
Luo Minmin.

241
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,280
I know you.

242
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,240
You're the girl

243
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,000
ranking last.

244
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,520
Don't be shy.

245
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,000
You are in the same level.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,280
Pretty close.

247
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,440
Luo Minmin.

248
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
You caught a thief

249
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,400
on your first mission.

250
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,000
You deserve praise.

251
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,280
Really?

252
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,520
Miss Luo,

253
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,040
you're kind.

254
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,480
If you wanna be

255
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
a good police officer,

256
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,400
do the right things you think.

257
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
Captain Chen is right.

258
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,800
You will be a good police officer.

259
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,920
At least you have

260
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
more chances than me.

261
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,680
Dad.

262
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,880
Dad!

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,400
You forced

264
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
Minmin to stay at home

265
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,240
every day.

266
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,480
What if she's feeling down?

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
She's probably gonna

268
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,360
work at the police station again

269
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,520
after being praised.

270
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,640
I understand.

271
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,200
But

272
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,640
look at her now.

273
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
She used to argue with me.

274
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,760
But now

275
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,040
she is as timid as a rabbit.

276
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,920
Isn't it your wish?

277
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,120
Mr. Xiang!

278
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,880
Finally!

279
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,000
I went to the Fourth Station.

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,280
They said you'd moved here.

281
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,360
Why are you here?

282
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,760
Can you go to my home tonight?

283
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,520
What's wrong?

284
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,520
Is Miss Luo getting worse?

285
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
No.

286
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,280
But she is in a dilemma.

287
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,800
She is locked in home

288
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,880
by my father.

289
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,480
I've

290
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,600
come up with a solution.

291
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,760
But I need your help.

292
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,760
Can you?

293
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
My sister needs you.

294
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I got you.

295
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
Thank you. See you tonight.

296
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Who is she?

297
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,400
Luo Minmin's sister.

298
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Does she need any help?

299
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
She asked me to visit Luo Minmin

300
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,880
in her home.

301
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,160
Shouldn't my team members

302
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,880
turn to me for help first?

303
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,640
But why to you?

304
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,080
Because

305
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,680
I'm the partner of Miss Luo.

306
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,640
And she got injured because of me.

307
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,640
It's reasonable for us to care

308
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,520
for each other.

309
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,520
Indeed.

310
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,160
Sounds great.

311
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,480
Follow me.

312
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,160
Sir,

313
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,680
do you like sailing?

314
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,040
My niece likes it.

315
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
He told me the story of

316
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
Magellan sailing around the world.

317
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,640
Have you heard of it?

318
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,840
I only heard about

319
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,480
the story of Balboa

320
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,760
who found the Pacific.

321
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,400
Nice to meet you.

322
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,720
I'm Qiao Jianshi.

323
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,640
Nice to meet you.

324
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,920
I'm Shi Junyu

325
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,720
I saw the code

326
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,160
on the newspaper.

327
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,040
I've been sent to inform you

328
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,280
of three tasks.

329
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,120
First.

330
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,080
You need to contact

331
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,640
a comrade in rest.

332
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,360
He is the only subordinate

333
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,760
of Deng Mingyuan.

334
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,480
He's entrusted

335
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
to us

336
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,240
for teamwork.

337
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,280
You'll be

338
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,520
his superior in the future.

339
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,680
I'll contact him soon.

340
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,480
Second.

341
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,960
This photo is from

342
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,280
the national salvation organization.

343
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,280
You may know the person in it.

344
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,160
Who took the photo?

345
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,720
A patriotic journalist

346
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,640
surnamed Peng of Shen Bao.

347
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Also a member of the NSO.

348
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,760
I heard

349
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,480
you're investigating the murder case.

350
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
When the killed is found,

351
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,040
you may need to think

352
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,680
how to deal with him

353
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,400
according to the picture.

354
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,640
I got it.

355
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,760
How about the transmitter

356
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,040
you're in charge of?

357
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,960
It's originally a 100-watt

358
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,040
Hartley transmitter.

359
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,200
I used it in my apartment.

360
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,280
The light flickered.

361
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,320
Besides, the electronic monitoring

362
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,280
is stricter.

363
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
So, I turned it into a 50-watt one.

364
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
The higher-ups decided to restart it

365
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,680
for contact

366
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,040
between Shanghai and the Central.

367
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,120
This is the third task.

368
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
But

369
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,200
we are shorthanded now.

370
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,120
We don't have operators,

371
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,840
telegraph operators or interpreters.

372
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
That's to say,

373
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
you need to be

374
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,480
responsible

375
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,400
for all these

376
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,520
yourself.

377
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
No problem.

378
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,400
I can.

379
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,480
Work can be resumed at any time.

380
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,440
The transmitter

381
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,880
has to be restarted now.

382
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,960
Because it's

383
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
related to the pivotal task.

384
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,760
Our nation is in danger.

385
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,280
But someone haven't awakened.

386
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,480
The situation is severe.

387
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,440
All patriots must be united to fight

388
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,640
and force Chiang

389
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,480
to resist Japanese invaders.

390
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
The whole nation

391
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,320
should pool efforts.

392
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,120
The NSO is

393
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,400
an important part.

394
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,600
It's the top target of the united front.

395
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,600
You're required

396
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,240
to continue leading the group

397
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
and join the plan of the NSO.

398
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,120
Mrs. Ji

399
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,480
will be

400
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,520
an intermediary between you

401
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,400
and the NSO.

402
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,960
And the transmitter

403
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,720
is used to contact Shanghai and the Central.

404
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I got it.

405
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,120
Deng Mingyuan

406
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,040
gave me this letter in prison.

407
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,160
My original purpose in coming

408
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,840
to Shanghai

409
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,000
was to carry out the rescue plan.

410
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,240
But he refused the plan

411
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,000
even he knew that

412
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,000
returning

413
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,080
to Nanjing meant sacrifice.

414
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,120
He hoped

415
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,480
that CPC can preserve its strength

416
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
in the most difficult times,

417
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,920
rather than falling into

418
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,440
a more dangerous situation to rescue him.

419
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,440
Following his instructions,

420
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,920
I retrieved this key to a safe

421
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,240
at HSBC.

422
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,840
Inside are the last funds

423
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,440
Mr. and

424
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,400
Mrs. Meng

425
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,440
raised for ISKRA.

426
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,480
The key is now yours.

427
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,680
Your team

428
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,520
has been

429
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,600
supporting ISKRA

430
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
without interruption.

431
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,280
The higher-ups

432
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,480
asked me to express

433
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
praise and respect

434
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,080
for all you've done,

435
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,800
and each and every

436
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,040
sacrifice.

437
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,760
Deng Mingyuan did this

438
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,960
to help us

439
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,280
go further.

440
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,360
Even if in the end

441
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,720
only one comrade remains,

442
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,200
as long as the fight continues,

443
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,000
his efforts will not be in vain.

444
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,400
Sir, we're closed now.

445
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,440
What can I do for you?

446
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Mr. Fan.

447
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Hello?

448
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,520
Can you finally

449
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,240
tell me who was looking for

450
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,400
the girl in the photo?

451
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,200
It's...

452
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,800
a call from the mahjong parlor.

453
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
You seem so tense. Calm down.

454
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,000
Take it easy.

455
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,120
Hurry up!

456
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,600
Bring me my fruit platter!

457
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,760
Here, pour some water!

458
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,600
Right away!

459
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,880
Yes.

460
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,520
I was the one who called

461
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,400
the pawnshop with the address.

462
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
Actually,

463
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,600
I have a handyman working for me

464
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,240
named Luo Tianxiang.

465
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,160
He said

466
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,360
he saw the girl

467
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,480
going home by chance on the street.

468
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,920
Is he here?

469
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,720
You mean Luo Tianxiang?

470
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,440
No, he's off today.

471
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,280
Give me his address.

472
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,160
I don't remember it

473
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,240
exactly.

474
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,680
But his father

475
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,280
opened a

476
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,680
photo studio nearby.

477
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
How about

478
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,480
I call

479
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,440
Captain Chen at the

480
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,400
Fourth Station?

481
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,000
Tianxiang's sister

482
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
is a police officer

483
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,480
there.

484
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
Chen will definitely know

485
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,720
the address.

486
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,800
A police officer?

487
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,520
Yes.

488
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,920
She's injured days before.

489
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,760
Actually,

490
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,800
Tianxiang took a leave

491
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
to take care of her.

492
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,240
It's a sad family story.

493
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,800
Well,

494
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,120
I'll call Captain Chen

495
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,800
right now.

496
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,760
No need.

497
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,080
Why?

498
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,120
He must know the address.

499
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,760
I'll...

500
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,240
No need.

501
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Sir.

502
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,560
Which station are you from?

503
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,120
You don't

504
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,840
sound local...

505
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,760
Hello?

506
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Please connect me

507
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,200
to the Fourth Station of Shiliupu.

508
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,880
Yes.

509
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,240
Hello?

510
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,600
Another win!

511
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
Thank you!

512
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,440
Waiter.

513
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,960
I'm out.

514
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,520
Bring me

515
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
some more money.

516
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,280
More?

517
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,800
Just not my night.

518
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,240
Sure,

519
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,960
I'll go talk to the boss.

520
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,000
Sorry about that.

521
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,000
Mr. Wang.

522
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Sir!

523
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,160
Mr. Li

524
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,320
is asking for more money.

525
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,960
Luo Minmin?

526
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,200
The female officer

527
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,520
you injured?

528
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,800
The address was sold

529
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,360
on the black market by her brother.

530
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
She must know

531
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
where Meng Duoci is.

532
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,160
She's seen your face.

533
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
I'll head to her home.

534
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,040
Dad! Brother!

535
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,520
What?

536
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:58,960
What happened?

537
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,040
Dad!

538
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,840
What's wrong?

539
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,880
Come here!

540
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,720
What is it?

541
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,560
Come down now!

542
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,480
The... rat ate the meat!

543
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,560
Where is it?

544
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,120
Under... that table!

545
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,880
Where?

546
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,800
Come down first!

547
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,600
No, I'm scared!

548
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,480
Just come down!

549
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Qinqin?

550
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,040
Where's the rat?

551
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,720
Where is it?

552
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,040
Where?

553
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,880
Where is it?

554
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,280
What happened?

555
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,440
It went under the table.

556
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,080
Come down!

557
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,600
No, impossible!

558
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,120
It went that way!

559
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,840
It's gone.

560
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,560
You...

561
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,080
Why are you here?

562
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,760
Do you wanna

563
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,800
go out for a walk?

564
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,240
With me?

565
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,280
No,

566
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,440
I haven't even washed my face.

567
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,840
And I'm still in pajamas...

568
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,640
How

569
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,320
can I go out like this?

570
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,040
Where is it?

571
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
It's right inside!

572
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,960
I saw it running in!

573
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,920
Tianxiang, get the flashlight.

574
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,480
Okay.

575
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,640
Where did I put it?

576
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,560
Here it is.

577
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,920
Dad.

578
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,040
Here you are.

579
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,040
Do him a favor.

580
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,440
Come down.

581
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,040
I won't.

582
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,760
Come down.

583
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,560
You know?

584
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,200
Just come down.

585
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,120
Quick.

586
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,760
Stop drinking that.

587
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,000
Did you bite this?

588
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,120
I had no choice.

589
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,000
The meat

590
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,280
is too salty.

591
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,000
You're incredible.

592
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,240
Dad, have you found it?

593
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
No, it might have run off.

594
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,840
No way.

595
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,000
I saw it going under there!

596
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,000
Where is the meat?

597
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,240
Here.

598
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,080
Such a big bite?

599
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
It's that big of a rat.

600
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,320
It must be huge.

601
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,800
Maybe I should just come down

602
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,120
and try walking.

603
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
Minmin!

604
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,000
Dad...

605
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,880
Minmin!

606
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,840
Dad, you got it wrong!

607
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,480
Dad!

608
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,040
Minmin!

609
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Dad!

610
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,360
The door is still open...

611
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,680
Minmin!

612
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,040
Dad, enough!

613
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,800
Minmin!

614
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,520
My dad seems to have wandered off.

615
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,840
Did Luo Qinqin

616
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
call you over?

617
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,280
No.

618
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
It must be.

619
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,720
What did she say to you?

620
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,520
Honestly, no one.

621
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,720
So, are you coming for me on your own?

622
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,760
The boat is shaking.

623
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,960
Because of the wind.

624
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,520
Not necessarily.

625
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,040
Out at sea, there're often swell waves.

626
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,960
The mechanical gravitational waves

627
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,880
could just be

628
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,600
continuations of distant surges.

629
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,200
But they're

630
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
hard to see with the naked eye.

631
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,640
I see.

632
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,280
Because the water is clear.

633
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,280
No, because the wavelength is very long.

634
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,800
You're talking about the sea,

635
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,840
but we are

636
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,480
in a little river channel here.

637
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,640
Yuansheng,

638
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,640
before here,

639
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
were you really a fisherman

640
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,080
out at sea every day?

641
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,480
Miss Luo,

642
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,080
our boat seems to

643
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,440
have drifted from the shore.

644
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,760
Where are we?

645
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,040
Up ahead is the river mouth.

646
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,520
Just beyond that, it's the Huangpu River.

647
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,040
The Huangpu River?

648
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,040
I haven't been out for days.

649
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,600
Do you know how to row?

650
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,920
Since we've already drifted off,

651
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,000
why don't we

652
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,480
just go a bit further?

653
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:20,960
Sure.

654
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,120
Is it

655
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,040
the Huangpu River just ahead?

656
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,040
Yes.

657
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I've lived in Shanghai all my life,

658
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,480
seeing the Huangpu River every day.

659
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
But I've never actually

660
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,040
rowed on it.

661
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,200
Where does the River

662
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,480
flow to next?

663
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
The East China Sea,

664
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
and finally into the Pacific Ocean.

665
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,040
The Pacific Ocean?

666
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,960
Have you been there?

667
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
Yes.

668
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,040
How big is it?

669
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
It's vast.

670
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
About several hundred

671
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,560
thousand times the size of Shanghai.

672
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,520
Oh my goodness.

673
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,200
Can you tell me more

674
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,120
about the Pacific Ocean?

675
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,280
At the southernmost tip of China,

676
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,280
in the western Pacific Ocean,

677
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,040
there's a territory known as the Nansha Qundao,

678
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,440
and a sea called the South China Sea.

679
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,720
I once passed through there by ship.

680
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,720
Lying on deck at night,

681
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,000
I saw hundreds of shooting stars

682
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
fall from the sky,

683
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,360
and the Milky Way

684
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,280
slowly sinking into the Ocean.

685
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,600
At that moment,

686
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,440
I felt incredibly small.

687
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,040
Yet, it's amazing

688
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,720
how our tiny eyes

689
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,280
can hold such vast expanses.

690
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,280
People aren't really that small.

691
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,280
Right.

692
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,760
We are stronger

693
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,240
than we think.

694
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,880
The places you've mentioned,

695
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,760
and the sights you've seen,

696
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,120
I've never heard of them before.

697
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,480
Luo Qinqin was right.

698
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,280
You really do know a lot.

699
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
I just knew about them

700
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,600
before you did.

701
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,120
Now that I've told you,

702
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,800
don't you know them too?

703
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,080
Besides,

704
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,760
there are things

705
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,200
you can do that I can't.

706
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,560
Really?

707
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,040
Like what?

708
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,600
Martial arts gymnastics.

709
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,040
What?

710
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,120
You can do gymnastics,

711
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
but I can't.

712
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
I learned it

713
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,880
during police training.

714
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,120
But I only know some movements.

715
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,800
If you were to learn,

716
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,480
you'd have been better at it than me.

717
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,800
You and my sister

718
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,680
are the same,

719
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,400
able to

720
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,560
understand a book at a glance,

721
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,720
excelling

722
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,520
at anything you learn.

723
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,040
You know what kind of person I am?

724
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,040
Your dad once said,

725
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,120
you may get

726
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,920
answers wrong

727
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,320
even if they're given to you,

728
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,520
learn slowly,

729
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,920
and may not apply and make good use

730
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,040
of the knowledge you've learned in practice.

731
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,720
For example,

732
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,200
you went through police training,

733
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,720
but when truly

734
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,200
face-to-face with a criminal,

735
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,480
you lack the ability

736
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,840
to protect yourself.

737
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,600
Basically,

738
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,440
you can't do much.

739
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,680
Why did he say these about me?

740
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,080
But I asked myself,

741
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
if I knew as little

742
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,040
as you,

743
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,120
facing the killer that night,

744
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,720
would I have the courage

745
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,200
to fight back like you did?

746
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
I doubt

747
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
I would.

748
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Most people probably wouldn't.

749
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,520
Being strong is not always about capability.

750
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,240
That's

751
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,840
what I had never considered before.

752
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,840
Who let the guy in?

753
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,000
Speak up!

754
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Say it!

755
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,000
Wait.

756
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,640
You actually teamed up

757
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,640
to deceive me.

758
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,000
Sorry to bother.

759
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,040
May I ask

760
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,280
if Mr. Luo Tianxiang lives here?

761
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,000
Who might you be?

762
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm a friend of him.

763
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,160
He's been called to the mahjong parlor.

764
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,000
Is Miss Luo in then?

765
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,040
I heard she's injured on duty.

766
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,560
I'm a columnist.

767
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,480
I'd like to write for her bravery.

768
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,560
My son doesn't have

769
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,040
any friends from Japan.

770
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,280
My daughter is no longer a police officer.

771
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,040
Miss Luo must know

772
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,840
where the girl she saved is,

773
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,800
right?

774
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,000
Meeting Meng Duoci would also work.

775
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,040
I don't know any Meng Duoci,

776
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,880
and we're not interested in publicity.

777
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,680
Is this where Miss Luo lives?

778
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,760
Yes,

779
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,160
it's supposed to be at No. 55.

780
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,400
No. 55?

781
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,000
This is No. 38.

782
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,760
So it must be further down.

783
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,440
This is so annoying!

784
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,680
Um, well...

785
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,240
we're here for Minmin.

786
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,600
Dad.

787
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,760
How did you all get here?

788
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,680
Minmin,

789
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,800
you're finally back.

790
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,080
We've been waiting for you.

791
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,000
She's already here.

792
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,320
You can

793
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,560
leave with all you have.

794
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:10,960
Tianxiang.

795
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,560
See the guests out.

796
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,840
Dad.

797
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,320
They're my friends...

798
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,080
Qinqin.

799
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
Take your sister upstairs!

800
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,760
Dad, Minmin is right.

801
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,040
These are her friends...

802
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,400
You call them friends?

803
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,400
And you!

804
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,720
Make friends with Japanese?

805
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,400
I... I don't know any.

806
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
There's a man coming

807
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,760
for someone called Meng Duoci.
