00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,320
Feng Sir,

4
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
we offer you

5
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,560
one last chance,

6
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,680
to talk with us.

7
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,720
What's there to talk about?

8
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,080
I know Tan Shiyuan and my brother

9
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
are smuggling military supplies

10
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
with Nakamura Naoki,

11
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,200
and I know

12
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
you're not the one

13
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,720
behind the deal.

14
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,480
We suggest

15
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,560
not to make scapegoat

16
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,160
of Tan Shiyuan.

17
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
Get to the point.

18
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,520
What do you want?

19
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,840
The manifest

20
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
and the pass.

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
If I

22
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,080
gave you those,

23
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,840
I'd have

24
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,680
no leverage left.

25
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,320
But,

26
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
even if you don't,

27
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
you already

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
have no leverage.

29
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,080
If you just want

30
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
the pass and the manifest,

31
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
just kill me.

32
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,200
I have a deal for you.

33
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,760
In other words,

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
we offer you help.

35
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,720
Help?

36
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,880
If the information is correct,

37
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,320
you've been suspended

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,280
by Tan Shiyuan.

39
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,360
Not cooperating with us could be

40
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
very dangerous for you.

41
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
Knowing Tan Shiyuan as I do,

42
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,320
the suspension is just a smokescreen.

43
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,520
If you got out of the car now,

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,080
two things could happen:

45
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,160
one,

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,880
he pins

47
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,480
the smuggling totally on you,

48
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
and you take the fall;

49
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,680
two,

50
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
you might not make it home

51
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,000
because you would die

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,120
in an "accident."

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,760
Of course,

54
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
there's a third option,

55
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
you do nothing,

56
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,680
but we still

57
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
have countless ways

58
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,160
to expose your crimes.

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,480
Not only you and Tan Shiyuan

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,360
would be punished,

61
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
but you'd also be despised

62
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,360
by every Chinese,

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,600
branded as a traitor

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,320
and a lapdog for the Japanese.

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,720
What do you propose?

66
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,760
Hand over the pass and the manifest,

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,560
and tell us everything

68
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,360
you know.

69
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,360
And,

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,360
declare that the warrant for Chen Hao's

71
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,160
supposed murder is fabricated

72
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
and cancel the warrant.

73
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
What do I get out of this?

74
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
A chance to live.

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
I have one condition:

76
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,640
I must leave Shanghai

77
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,000
and get away from Tan Shiyuan's influence.

78
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,160
I can arrange for you to go to Nanjing

79
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,120
and be investigated

80
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,720
by the police there.

81
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,280
One for each of us,

82
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,400
to ensure it's secure.

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll wait for your message.

84
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,960
You go first!

85
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,560
I'll cover you!

86
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,160
What about you?

87
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,880
Let's go together!

88
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,680
The evidence is crucial.

89
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
Meet at the civilian house.

90
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,080
Okay,

91
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,840
see you there.

92
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Catch that person!

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,320
Yes, Sir.

94
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,520
Hello?

95
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,080
[Mr. Nakamura,]

96
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,560
[the pass]

97
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,600
has been secured,

98
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,080
and the Shinei Maru

99
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,440
can set sail tomorrow.

100
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
There must be no more mistakes.

101
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,760
Anything else?

102
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
Deputy Director Tan,

103
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,520
there was a shootout at Sanyang Fisheries.

104
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,840
Feng Guangyun is killed,

105
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,120
and Hua Zhen was taken.

106
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,320
Who took him?

107
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
It seems to be the Reviving Society.

108
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
It looks like

109
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,960
Hua's family is handling

110
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,600
their internal affairs.

111
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,880
We should just watch

112
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,080
and stay out of it.

113
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,200
Did you put protesters

114
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,880
against Shinei Maru under arrest?

115
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
Someone protected the organizers

116
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,800
and gathered them all

117
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,840
in the middle of the crowd.

118
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,520
Deputy Director Tan,

119
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,920
what should we do now?

120
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,960
If we make arrests by force,

121
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
it will definitely lead to a bloody conflict.

122
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
Are you suggesting we wait?

123
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
If the Shinei Maru

124
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,440
doesn't leave the port,

125
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,360
we're all finished.

126
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,120
Understood.

127
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
[I'm meeting with you now]

128
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
[to pass an important]

129
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,320
[information.]

130
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,480
[We've learned]

131
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,600
[that there are agents from the Reviving Society]

132
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,160
[at the A.G. Beer in the French Concession.]

133
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
[It's a critical moment to prevent]

134
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,280
[the Shinei Maru from leaving port.]

135
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
[You must ensure our actions]

136
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,960
[are not disrupted by them.]

137
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,920
I had a suspicion of this.

138
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,200
[After Wei Daiqing went after me,]

139
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,600
[I discreetly investigated]

140
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,320
[the background of A.G. Beer]

141
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,040
[and found their inquiry]

142
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,760
[seemed focused solely on Hua Zhen]

143
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,320
[and was different]

144
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,400
[from the usual actions]

145
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,360
[of the Reviving Society.]

146
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,640
[I then used the Council's authority]

147
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,520
[to access their rental information]

148
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,080
[and confirmed that the tenant's identity]

149
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,560
[is indeed connected to the Hua family.]

150
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
[This suggests]

151
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,520
[that the company might actually]

152
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,200
[be Hua's own people]

153

[investigating Hua Zhen's]

154
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,360
[activities in Shanghai.]

155
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,960
When I discovered Hua Liang

156
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,160
was in Shanghai,

157
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,360
I directly contacted him.

158
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,240
Mr. Hua? You have a call.

159
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Hello?

160
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,640
[Mr. Hua Liang,]

161
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,960
[the beer company you opened]

162
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,160
[in the French Concession,]

163
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,240
[your brother doesn't know about it, right?]

164
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
From his reaction,

165
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,520
I must have guessed right.

166
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
Once the facade is torn down,

167
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,880
the dissolution of A.G. Beer

168
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,240
isn't far off.

169
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,320
We've arrived.

170

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,480
[with Wei Daiqing.]

178
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,280
And this,

179
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,280
isn't this the watch

180
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I gave you?

181
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,120
I remember

182
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,480
I gave it to you

183
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,880
when you got into S.M.C.

184
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,760
I think it was

185
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
your first watch.

186
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
Feng Guangyun told me

187
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,640
you pawned it

188
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,720
to buy medicine for Chen Hao.

189
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,720
Next time, ask me for money

190
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,160
instead of

191
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,760
pawning things I gave you.

192
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,600
This is Jin Qin.

193
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,920
You

194
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,240
should have known him.

195
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,120
He was dad's bodyguard.

196
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,200
Mr. Hua.

197
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,000
After Wei Daiqing

198
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,880
was expelled from

199
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,720
the Shanghai Garrison Command,

200
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,000
the investigation against you

201
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,280
never actually stopped.

202
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,360
Mr. Hua arranged for him

203
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,560
to join the Secret Service

204
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,640
to put him under control

205
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,040
and

206
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,320
to use him

207
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,520
to eliminate any communists around you

208
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,040
and destroy any evidence

209
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,160
that could be harmful to you.

210
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,640
You can treat

211
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,520
Wei Daiqing like a dog,

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,480
but Mr. Hua did all this

213
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,480
to protect you.

214
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,720
Is Mrs. Ji

215
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,200
at your place?

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,240
I thought your primary concern right now

217
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
would be this manifest.

218
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,480
Let them release her.

219
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
She's already dead.

220
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,800
What time is it?

221
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,920
Mom has been waiting for you to come home.

222
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,240
Come back to Nanjing with me.

223
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,320
Mr. Hua,

224
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,800
please.

225
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
[Do you know]

226
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,480
[how many people could get killed?]

227
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,880
What are you trying to do, exactly?

228
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm asking you,

229
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
what are you trying to do?

230
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm one of the company shareholders!

231
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,520
I'm involved in this

232
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,320
because I have to!

233
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,640
It's my duty!

234
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,040
The cowards hiding in the shadows,

235
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,560
do you need to know who they are?

236
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,080
What difference does it make

237
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,200
if you understand all this?

238
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,920
Can you stop it?

239
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,520
Even the Chairman

240
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,320
can not.

241
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,720
The world

242
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,760
isn't black or white.

243
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,640
You want to change the world,

244
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,240
but does the world

245
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,480
need you to change it?

246
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,440
Does it?

247
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,280
It won't even allow you to change it.

248
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,960
Indeed, the world

249
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,160
isn't just black or white,

250
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,480
but there's always right or wrong.

251
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,840
[Hua Zhen!]

252
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,440
[What are you doing, have you lost your mind?]

253
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,160
What's going on?

254
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,440
Are we under attack?

255
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,360
Who did it?

256
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,080
The Communists?

257
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,960
What Communists?

258
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,920
The company has been dissolved.

259
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Dissolved?

260
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,800
Where's Jin Qin?

261
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,160
Get Jin Qin here.

262
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,120
I'll ask him directly!

263
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,160
Mr. Jin left yesterday.

264
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,560
He left?

265
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,400
Excuse me,

266
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,720
why... why don't you

267
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,040
call Mr. Yu

268
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,840
and ask if he

269
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,720
knows about this?

270
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,800
Mr. Yu?

271
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,880
Which Mr. Yu?

272
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,200
Our boss,

273
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,360
the one known as Mr. Yu...

274
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
I don't know about this.

275
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,440
It's above your pay grade...

276
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,200
Above your pay grade...

277
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,840
Excuse me, Mr. Wei,

278
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,600
I need you to

279
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,400
return the car key.

280
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,080
Above your pay grade...

281
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,000
Mr. Wei?

282
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,880
Above...

283
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,920
Mr. Yu probably

284
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,720
doesn't know about this.

285
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,280
Mr. Yu doesn't know.

286
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,640
You... stop moving things.

287
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,360
Stop...

288
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,920
Don't move...

289
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,160
Stop it...

290
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,920
[Hurry up!]

291
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Please stop moving.

292
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,000
Just stop.

293
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,880
Hurry!

294
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm begging you,

295
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,880
please stop!

296
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,920
Who are you anyway?

297
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,520
Who are you?

298
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,440
I don't recognize you.

299
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm the landlord. What's the issue?

300
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,520
Landlord?

301
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,960
Yes,

302
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,840
Mr. Jin told me

303
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,600
he's taken

304
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
everything useful

305
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,800
and left the rest

306
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,880
for me to handle.

307
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,440
Sir,

308
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
did Mr. Jin tell you

309
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,560
how long he rented this place?

310
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,480
It's on a monthly basis.

311
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,720
There are still a few days left this month,

312
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,880
and he suddenly asked me to take over.

313
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,440
That doesn't make sense.

314
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
That doesn't make any sense,

315
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,560
sir!

316
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Are you crazy?

317
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,520
You brat!

318
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,440
Come on, move it!

319
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,560
I'm not a brat!

320
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,720
I,

321
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
am Wei Daiqing,

322
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,920
the director of the Secret Service of the Reviving Society

323
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,280
under the National Government!

324
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,280
Without my permission,

325
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,640
none of you

326
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,160
can touch my things!

327
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,600
[He's lost it!]

328
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,720
It doesn't make any sense.

329
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,200
Why is this happening?

330
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,280
Why?

331
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,960
Why is this happening?

332
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,240
[It's not over.]

333
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,680
It's not over yet!

334
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,920
I still have leads!

335
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,920
Chen Hao!

336
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Chen Hao!

337
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm okay.

338
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,520
What about Xiang Yuansheng?

339
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,720
Has he come back yet?

340
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
He hasn't.

341
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,120
What happened exactly?

342
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,240
How did you end up like this?

343
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,600
Someone shot at us,

344
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,080
and Feng Guangyun is dead.

345
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,280
Xiang Yuansheng and I

346
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,720
were supposed to meet here.

347
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,080
Here's the pass.

348
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
The manifest is with Xiang Yuansheng.

349
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,240
You're badly hurt.

350
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,720
I need to get you to a hospital first.

351
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,200
Forget about me,

352
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,920
go to the newspaper office.

353
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,800
It's crucial

354
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,880
to expose the pass and the manifest.

355
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,080
No,

356
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,880
we have to go together.

357
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,120
I can't.

358
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,840
I really can't move.

359
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
The mission is what matters most.

360
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,560
This is our last chance.

361
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Forget about me.

362
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,760
Mrs. Ji...

363
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Mrs. Ji...

364
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,240
Mrs. Ji is gone.

365
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
We can't afford

366
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,720
any more losses in our team.

367
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,760
You... you wait here.

368
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,720
I'll contact our comrades

369
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,000
to get you out.

370
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,760
Chen Hao,

371
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
your new mission

372
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,080
is to survive.

373
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,800
Hang in there.

374
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
Alright,

375
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,120
I'll complete the mission.

376
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,480
Just go.

377
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,920
Go.

378
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,000
Go!

379
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,040
Go!

380
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Go!

381
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,120
Go!

382
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,080
Dad,

383
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm stepping out.

384
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,880
Where are you heading? Wait!

385
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,520
What are you up to?

386
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,080
Dad...

387
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,560
Dad...

388
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,560
Dad,

389
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,280
I have to go.

390
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,600
No.

391
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,880
Dad,

392
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,320
they need me.

393
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,360
No.

394
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,360
They need me.

395
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,560
Wait for me.

396
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,800
Here.

397
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,080
I will wait for you at home.

398
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,920
Sir,

399
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,600
this car was repaired yesterday.

400
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
We fixed bullet holes

401
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,240
and replaced two tires,

402
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,720
that's all.

403
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,280
I don't need this info right now!

404
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,720
I need to know

405
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
where they went.

406
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,640
How would I know that?

407
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,400
You must know at least

408
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,360
the direction they headed!

409
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,680
I... I only have

410
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,600
a rough idea.

411
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,280
Fine!

412
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,320
We'll follow

413
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,160
the tire tracks,

414
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,560
road by road!

415
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,280
Let's go!

416
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,520
Okay, okay.

417
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,840
Chen Hao!

418
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,920
Chen Hao!

419
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,160
Chen Hao!

420
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,920
Mr. Hua,

421
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
there's nothing left for you

422
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,120
to argue about, is there?

423
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,960
Where is Chen Hao?

424
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,920
Still worried

425
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,360
about your Communist comrade?

426
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,440
I'm asking you where Chen Hao is.

427
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,320
Admitting it, aren't you?

428
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,400
The one hiding in the false wall

429
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,760
at Shengen Book Store last time was him, right?

430
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,000
You don't have

431
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,520
his luck this time.

432
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,560
No more

433
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,360
communist comrades

434
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,320
or Ms. bullshit Shi from bullshit Council

435
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,160
to rescue you now.

436
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,800
Do you know why you

437
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,880
always lose?

438
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,560
I lost?

439
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,760
Yes,

440
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,680
I've lost before.

441
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,640
And why?

442
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,120
Because our party state

443
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,080
is filled with people like you

444
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,680
who get

445
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,440
everything easily

446
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
without any effort!

447
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,360
Not today.

448
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,520
Young Master Hua,

449
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,360
haven't I told you before?

450
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,440
If it wasn't for your surname Hua,

451
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
could you withstand

452
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,800
my investigation?

453
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,960
Not a chance!

454
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,880
Don't lump me

455
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,160
together with the Hua family.

456
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,560
That's right.

457
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,280
In this situation,

458
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
even your father

459
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,640
and brother combined

460
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,800
couldn't save you.

461
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,760
Who wins and who loses

462
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,640
is no longer something

463
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,000
your Hua family can decide.

464
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,720
[The newspaper sets its final print]

465
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
[at one o'clock every afternoon,]

466
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,600
[so we must]

467
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,080
[get the evidence earlier]

468
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,120
[and bring it back.]

469
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,360
Even if I died here today,

470
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,440
you wouldn't win

471
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
because you don't know

472
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,600
what you're fighting for,

473
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,280
nor do you understand

474
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,960
what faith and ideals are about.

475
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,800
You're just

476
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,440
climbing up the ladder

477
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,000
for your vanity,

478
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,760
or so-called fame and fortune,

479
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,640
because you don't really know

480
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,600
what you want.

481
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,160
I don't need to know

482
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,360
what I want.

483
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
But I know

484
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
that what I want most now

485
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,560
is to prove you're a communist!

486
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,120
I want to prove to everyone

487
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,120
that I

488
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,720
was right from the very beginning.

489
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,880
Prove to whom?

490
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,600
To the Reviving Society

491
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,400
behind A.G. Beer?

492
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,960
You don't really think

493
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,760
they had an interest in you, do you?

494
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,280
Don't be naive.

495
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,680
It's just a trap set by Hua Liang

496
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,240
to find me.

497
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,320
From beginning to end,

498
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,960
you were just a pawn.

499
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,760
You're right.

500
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,240
Captain,

501
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
hold on.

502
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,960
Stay with me.

503
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,320
Don't fall asleep.

504
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,880
Captain,

505
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,360
you said it,

506
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,840
we're going to have a victory meeting.

507
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,480
Promise me,

508
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,520
Captain,

509
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,200
don't fall asleep!
