Dongbao is considering it.

136

We cannot predict the result.

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,400
I just

can't part with the uniform.

145
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Even a registry

147
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,200

149

I'm gonna tell you our jobs.

152

You wouldn't believe it.

153
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
I'm now a taxi driver.

154
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,080
You know that.

155
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,960
Hongfa's restaurant

156
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,720

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
It's closed.

158
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,040
He's working at a mall

159
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,400
as a salesperson.

160
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Our director

163
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,640
Yes,

164
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,760
it's good.

165
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,680
Like retirement.

What about Chen Hao?

167
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,840
I don't know.

168
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,280
We don't see him much.

169
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
I don't care.

170
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,880
Watch your tone.

171
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,920
He is doing well,

172
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,440
just like me,

173
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,720
at Shiliupu.

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,840
He's in the Criminal

Unbelievable, right?

178
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,520
Despite the unhappy past,

179
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
he was left behind by Feng.

180
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,280
And

181
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,080
he is

182
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,520
willing to do so.

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,440
He

184
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
is smarter

185
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,760
than I thought.

186
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,760
It's all because he made his mark

187
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
with the murder case.

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
What you're saying...

189
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
is not wrong.

190
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,560
Since he handed over

191
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
the killer to the Concession,

192
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,640
the female inspector

193
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,320
put in a good word for him.

194
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
It actually worked.

195
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,040
Then he's got promoted.

196
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,520
Otherwise, he'd guard at the

197
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,200
entrance

198
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
while I serve the meal.

199
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,040
That's all for him.

200
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,400
But

201
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
why hasn't Minmin arrived yet?

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
[She's still at the training class.]

203
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,280
I left her a note.

204
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,440
She should be here soon.

205
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,520
[There's no rush.]

206
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,560
[Let's wait then.]

207
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,160
[Anyone want coriander?]

208
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,280
I do.

209
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,920
It's so cold out there.

210
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,440
Speak of the devil!

211
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,120
I tried to learn driving today

212
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,280
and almost got kicked out.

213
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,120
[I just saw a jeep parked]

214

[If I had a car like that,]

217
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,920
I'd practice every day.

218
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,280
Literally...

219
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,280
[Surprise!]

220
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Yuansheng is back!

221
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,640
Long time no see.

222
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,360
When did you get back?

223
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,760
Just arrived today.

224
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
[Have a sit.]

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
[We've been waiting for you!]

[Come on!]

227
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,200

[Warm you up.]

237

239
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,400

came back

244
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,040
with the school fleet,

245
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,400
[heading to Nanjing on a boat.]

you wanna reapply for the police.

252
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,520
And you?

253
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
How long will you stay?

254
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
About a week.

255
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,040
It's my first time

256
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,440
seeing you in uniform.

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,280
You look pretty sharp.

how our Station got shut down?

317
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,320
I had someone look into it.

318
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,080
Some stations need to be

319
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,200
cut down due to financial reasons.

320
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,440
But we're not among them.

321
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,400
Then added later.

that missing journalist's home.

326
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,920
Have you noticed

327
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,920
that the people who went there

328
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
were later dismissed,

329
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,240
but those didn't

331

Yes,

I can drive you back.

348
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,400
Nice, a ride back.

349

Weren't

351
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,360
When...

352
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,040
Let's go.

353
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,400
Yuansheng,

354
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,480
just drop Minmin off.

355
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
[Stop pulling me!]

356
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
I'll go with you.

357
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,600
Not good. We're gonna take a bath!

358
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,160
I'll take you back then.

359
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
Thanks for the trouble.

360
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,240
No worries.

361
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Still going to

362
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,920
the police training every day?

363
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,760
I remember you

364
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,520
graduated from there before.

365
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,360
But I barely

366
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,840
learned anything last time.

367
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,680
Felt like I understand nothing.

368
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,960
I wanna go through it again properly.

369
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,320
Willing to be back to the police force?

370
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,080
Haven't thought that far yet.

371
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,560
Right now,

372
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,880
just wanna learn as much as I can.

373
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,280
Being at the Fourth Station

374
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,520
made me realize

375
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,800
that I really don't know much.

376
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,320
Learning more now

377
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,840
will always be useful later.

378
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,160
Congratulations.

379
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,080
For what?

380
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,560
[Before I left Shanghai,]

381
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,440
you told me

382
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,560
that you wanna be someone useful.

383
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,000
You're

384
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,280
one step closer

385
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,360
to that goal.

386
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,240
You too.

387
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,160
Next time,

388
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,280
I might be calling you Captain Hua Zhen.

389
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,560
Luo Minmin.

390
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,880
at the train station that day,

391
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,000
I called to tell you

392
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,320
that we can write letters

393
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,280
and the address...

394
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,720
It's true I didn't write.

395
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,520
After you left,

396
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,400
I went back to the training academy,

397
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,520
filled with classes, practical exercises,

398
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,400
and so much

399
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
that I've never met before.

400
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
Like pistol shooting,

401
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
driving, etc.

402
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,640
I have to invest much time.

403
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,480
And I need to

404
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,240
help out at my dad's photo shop

405
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,560
when I get home.

406
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,720
I don't make any money.

407
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,640
My dad

408
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,720
can't manage alone.

409
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,160
I didn't have time on anything else.

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,600
You must be busy too, right?

411
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,760
[Probably even more than me.]

412
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,080
What are you trying to say?

413
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,320
I'm doing well now.

414
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,880
Every day is full.

415
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,360
Just let the holiday thing

416
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,600
be in the past.

417
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,560
In over two months,

418
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,360
you've moved forward a lot.

419
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,400
Haven't you as well?

420
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,640
We're both moving forward.

421
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,760
Although the Fourth Station has gone,

422
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,240
luckily we still see each other often.

423
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,800
When we're at Dongbao's place,

424
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
everyone says

425
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,400
it would be great if you could be there too.

426
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,400
It's not easy to have a few

427
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
good friends like that.

428
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Are we good friends then?

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Aren't we?

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,760
I guess

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,760
you're the only

432
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,720
influential friend

433
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll ever have.

434
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,240
If you think

435
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,560
we're just ordinary friends,

436
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
I'm okay with that too.

437
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
If you say so.

438
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
Excuse me,

439
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,400
are you alright?

440
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,080
Miss Luo,

441
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,280
do you remember me?

442
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,920
We met before

443
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,240
at the police station.

444
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,960
Oh, right.

445
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,320
Mrs. Peng,

446
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,960
you filed a report at the station before.

447
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
What's wrong?

448
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,360
[Don't worry,]

449
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
[he used to be an officer there as well.]

450
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,760
Mrs. Peng,

451
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,160
are you feeling unwell?

452
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,320
I have severe stomach pain.

453
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
Just came from the hospital.

454
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,800
This is my home.

455
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,320
How about

456
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,720
coming inside with me?

457
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,640
No,

458
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
I shouldn't.

459
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
I can't go in.

460
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,120
Earlier,

461
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,800
I didn't dare to knock on your door.

462
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,800
[Prevent you from any trouble.]

463
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,560
Is something wrong?

464
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,080
I really didn't know

465
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,800
who else to turn to.

466
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,360
I tried

467
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,800
going to your station,

468
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,040
but it's closed.

469
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,720
I escaped.

470
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,680
Someone is trying to catch me.

471
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
Who

472
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,200
I'd like to know that too.

473
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
Since my husband disappeared,

474
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,480
I've been hiding in a boarding house.

475
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,680
[I can't stand the stomach pain.]

476
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,520
So I went to Guangci Hospital.

477
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,560
But I didn't stay there for long.

478
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
As I went out,

479
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,920
a truck

480
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,320
was rushing to me.

481
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
Fortunately, I dodged it.

482
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,680
Then I jumped into a tram.

483
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,080
The truck

484
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,040
followed me around here.

485
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
[Who were]

486
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,560
[in that truck?]

487
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,800
I don't know.

488
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,040
Before my husband disappeared,

489
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,840
it parked

490
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,000
around my house several times.

491
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,600
No number plate.

492
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,840
But

493
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,520
I didn't pay attention to it.

494
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,720
Does anyone else know

495
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
where you currently live?

496
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,200
I don't think so.

497
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,960
But I reckon

498
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,240
they probably

499
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,560
found me

500
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,880
in the hospital.

501
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,240
Is it related to

502
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,680
my husband's disappearance?

503
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,560
Get out of here.

504
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,520
Who did this?

505
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,680
Go get them.

506
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,600
Mr. Xiang,

507
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,240
you can drive to a trail.

508
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,040
I'll carry

509
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,320
Mrs. Peng back.

510
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,640
They wouldn't

511
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,760
expect us to do this.

512
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,320
I have another idea.

513
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,320
What is it?

514
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,920
I can wear Mrs. Peng's clothes

515
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,080
to attract their attention.

516
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,400
Keep quiet.

517
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,360
Show your papers, please.

518
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,680

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,920
Thank you.

529
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,560
Let's go for Mrs. Peng.

530
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,560
We should go.

531
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,880
The doctor said

532
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,080
she's frightened

533
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,360
into a coma.

534
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,320
She's too weak

535
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,040
and needs rest.

536
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Would those guys break in?

537
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,880
It's an affiliated hospital to the shipyard.

538
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,520
All patients here are its employees.

539
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,440
Guards

540
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,040
are on duty 24/7.

541
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,120
This is the safest place

542
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,360
I had ever thought.

543
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,920
Such

544
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
being the case,

545
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,200
I should leave now.

546
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,360
Where are you going so late?

547
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,560
Home.

548
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,560
Follow me.

549
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,080
Inpatients are not too many,

550
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,720
This is available.

551
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,520
I will apply for you to stay

552
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,080
this night.

553
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,400
Are you worried that it's dangerous

554
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,440
for me to go back now?

555
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,200
No. In case no one beside her

556
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,240
when Mrs. Peng wakes up.

557
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,080
It sounds reasonable!

558
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,560
I should stay here.

559
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,320
I have to go.

560
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,240
Take care.

561
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,720
After she reported the case,

562
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,240
did you look into it?

563
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,200
Yes.

564
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,080
My colleagues and I

565
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,560
went to her home

566
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,480
for investigation.

567
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,000
Then,

568
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the captain told me

569
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,760
to leave it alone.

570
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,000
Are you saying Chen Hao?

571
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,560
He said he would investigate.

572
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,640
Then I haven't

573
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
paid any attention to this

574
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,400
since he's

575
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,160
transferred to Shiliupu.

576
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,520
Is something wrong?

577
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,720
Nothing.

578
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,600
Good night.

579
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,720
Mom,

580
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,440
is my brother at home?

581
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,880
[No.]

582
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,440
[He went on a business trip to Shanghai.]

583
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,960
Really?

584
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,800
When?

585
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,640
[He should have arrived yesterday.]

586
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
[Hasn't he contacted you?]

587
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,280
I got it, mom.

588
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,080
[A reporter surnamed Peng]

589
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,160
[is missing.]

590
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,680
[He is]

591
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,800
[my friend's relative.]

592
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Many are

593
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
looking for him.

594
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,920
I heard the case

595
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,560
was registered

596
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,520
in the station

597
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,400
you served in before.

598
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm entrusted to learn more.

599
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,960
[How did you]

600
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
[find the truck?]

601
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,920
[Since Mrs. Peng went to the police,]

602
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,880
[I have been]

603
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,600
[following her]

604
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,480
[in secret.]

605
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,040
[Today,]

606
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,680
[she went to Guangci Hospital.]

607
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,640
[When coming out,]

608
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,520
I spotted a truck without a number plate

609
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,320
parking at the gate.

610
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,440
I suspect that Feng Guangyun

611
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,280
privately raised

612
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,320
an action team

613
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,280
[with trucks]

614
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,920
[as the main tool.]

615
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,360
[I met a truck of the same type]

616
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,360
[when I investigated]

617
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,120
the murder case

618
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,760
with Yuansheng.

619
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,080
If it's true,

620
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,360
Peng's disappearance

621
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,120
is definitely related to the truck.

622
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,120
On which road did it disappear?

623
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,960
Fuhua Road.

624
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
It disappeared

625
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,600
after

626
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,880
turning a corner.

627
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,480
I thought

628
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,960
it drove into a yard.

629
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,440
There's

630
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,720
a gas station

631
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,120
at the intersection.

632
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,920
It should

633
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
be able to provide us

634
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,600
with some info

635
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,920
about trucks around there.

636
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:07,920
OK.

637
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,360
I'm in charge of it.

638
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,120
Hope we can find Peng

639
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
through the truck.

640
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,400
I didn't find his name

641
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,120
on the records

642
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,480
of Shiliupu's

643
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,320
detention house and the prisoners

644
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,400
transferred to Tilanqiao.

645
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,240
There's no interrogation record

646
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,280
except an arrest warrant.

647
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,640
Is it possible that

648
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,800
Mr. Peng had been executed?

649
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,320
I had thought of it.

650
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,080
But based on

651
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,480
what happened tonight,

652
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,600
we seem to still have a slim chance.

653
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,480
They came to

654
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,720
Mrs. Peng

655
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,800
because

656
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,080
they didn't get

657
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
what they want

658
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,040
from Mr. Peng.

659
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,560
In this case,

660
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,960
Mr. Peng is still valuable

661
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,240
to them.

662
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,480
In my opinion,

663
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,440
he should be detained

664
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,560
in an unknown place

665
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,080
until they find

666
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,400
what they want.

667
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,080
Now we have to

668
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,480
take Mrs. Peng to a safe place

669
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,680
as soon as possible.

670
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,360
Before, I followed Mr. Deng

671
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,800
into Jiangnan Shipyard.

672
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,440
Guests can only stay

673
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
the guesthouse

674
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,680
or the affiliated hospital.

675
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
The

676
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,800
guesthouse requires a letter.

677
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,280
Mrs. Peng

678
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,600
is more likely to be arranged

679
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,520
in the hospital

680
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,560
by Xiang Yuansheng

681
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,800
due to her stomach disease.

682
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,000
Our men working

683
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,960
for the Power Bureau

684
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
go to the shipyard

685
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
for maintenance

686
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,960
every Wednesday.

687
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,560
I'll request the organization

688
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,320
to arrange someone

689
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,080
to rescue her during such period.

690
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,680
Mr. Deng gave me

691
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,320
a technician certificate

692
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,160
of the Shipyard.

693
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,640
If your plan

694
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,440
didn't work,

695
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,240
I'd take her out.

696
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,760
No, except we're

697
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,840
driven into a corner.

698
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,320
Though you're

699
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,200
transferred,

700
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,880
Feng Guangyun

701
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,160
doesn't trust you.

702
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,240
You can't take risks.

703
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,800
What happened?

704
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,040
Mr. Feng,

705
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,080
that woman fled into

706
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,320
Jiangnan Shipyard

707
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,560
with naval men guarded`.

708
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,840
We can't go in.

709
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,600
Where?

710
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,800
Jiangnan Shipyard.

711
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
She got in

712
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
a military jeep.

713
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,160
Then

714
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,080
we saw it

715
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,200
driving in the Shipyard.

716
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,720
And allowed

717
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,680
in by the guards?

718
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,480
Yes.

719
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,080
Have we

720
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,960
offended

721
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,240
the military?

722
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,760
Did you see

723
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,640
who were in the jeep?

724
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,640
No.

725
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,320
Should be a man and a woman.

726
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,440
Did they see you?

727
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,040
Maybe not.

728
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,120
We stayed afar.

729
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,040
And

730
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,320
we don't have a number plate.

731
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,520
They can't trace anything.

732
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,320
Don't drive the truck

733
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,160
without my order.

734
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,280
And stay away

735
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,160
from the woman.

736
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,800
Why not

737
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,360
ask

738
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,600
the police to arrest and charge her,

739
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,080
just like what we did

740
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,280
to the reporter?

741
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,440
Who?

742
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,280
The police.

743
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,640
You're employed

744
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,200
to do dirty jobs.

745
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,280
Think twice

746
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,160
before you do something.

747
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,240
The woman

748
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,960
is already around us.

749
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,360
Sorry for that.

750
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,440
Absurd!

751
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,880
I have to

752
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,560
deal with it myself.

753
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,920
Listen up.

754
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,240
The accomplice to the

755
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,040
warehouse murder was found

756
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
hiding in Jiangnan Shipyard.

757
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
[Go there with me.]

758
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,120
[Yes, sir.]

759
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,680
Yes, sir.

760
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,400
Chief,

761
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,960
how about Chen Hao?

762
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,440
Are you suggesting

763
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,120
[leaving him]

764
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,560
[here to relax?]

765
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,800
Be quick.

766
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,960
Is the suspect

767
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,360
a man or a woman?

768
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,280
How catch the criminal

769
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,400
knowing nothing?

770
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,280
Don't talk nonsense.

771
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,400
Close up!

772
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,480
Here you are.

773
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,240
[Why so many policemen here?]

774
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,000
[Something must have happened.]

775
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,640
Stop there.

776
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,800
The Criminal

777
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,680
Investigation Dept.

778
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,000
requests a search

779
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
'cause a suspect

780
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,320
seems to be hiding inside.

781
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,320
Check the search warrant.

782
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,880
What suspect?

783
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,360
I can't tell you.

784
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,160
This is the restricted area.

785
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,440
Before any search,

786
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,200
you must contact the Security Dept.

787
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,000
Chief,

788
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,560
he refused us.

789
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,760
[What's wrong?]

790
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,920
You go first.

791
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
[OK.]

792
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,400
May I use the phone?

793
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,360
Chen Hao.

794
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,120
Sir.

795
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
You've been doing very well lately.

796
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,080
So,

797
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,960
I give you a chance

798
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,000
to talk with your old partner.

799
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,840
I haven't seen him for long.

800
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,720
Nothing to say.

801
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,160
This is a great chance.

802
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,360
You're in a close relationship

803
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,400
with him before.

804
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,440
Tell him to ask the guard

805
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,680
to allow us in,

806
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,840
'cause we don't have time

807
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,720
to contact the Dept.

808
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,920
I know him well.

809
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,560
He won't do me the favor.

810
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,000
I always think highly of you.

811
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,640
You've asked

812
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,560
about cases.

813
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,960
I know you wanna achieve results.

814
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,040
The time has come.

815
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,440
OK.

816
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,800
Stop.

817
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,120
Second lieutenant.

818
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,080
Long time no see.

819
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,480
I almost couldn't

820
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,600
recognize you in uniform.

821
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,480
When did you come here?

822
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,320
Just a few days.

823
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,880
Why are you here?

824
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,920
For a mission.

825
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,080
So do I.

826
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,520
We're told just now

827
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,080
that a fugitive is hiding here.

828
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,800
We wanna go in for a search.

829
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,080
The guard

830
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,360
has told you clearly.

831
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,880
It's not a military control area.

832
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,480
Shouldn't be managed so strictly.

833
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,320
Would you kindly

834
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,640
make an exception for us?

835
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,360
Not a military base,

836
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,240
but related to military secrets.

837
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Moreover,

838
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,880
we have a special mission here.

839
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,040
Even a registration in the Dept.

840
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,560
can't work.

841
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
I was called over by Mr. Feng.

842
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,840
Could you help me?

843
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,080
[Well,]

844
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,480
I'll make a detailed explanation

845
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,240
to help you respond better.

846
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,720
I come here

847
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,680
for a reception mission.

848
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,360
During this period,

849
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,720
it is impossible for the Shipyard

850
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,560
to allow unrelated policemen

851
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,960
to enter

852
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
at the risk of leakage of secrets.

853
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,200
So,

854
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,680
you can only

855
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,720
wait outside

856
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,360
until the mission ends.

857
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,720
Xiang Yuansheng

858
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,360
has been promoted to second lieutenant.

859
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,160
He said we couldn't defy their rules.

860
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,440
Let's go back.

861
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,800
The organization said

862
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
that Tan Shiyuan

863
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,800
will receive an honored guest

864
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,680
tomorrow noon.

865
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,240
The man

866
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,040
on the left may appear.

867
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,080
You have to

868
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,320
find a way to check it out.

869
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,360
We can't see his face.

870
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,920
His wrist is the point.

871
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,240
I amplified

872
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,480
the detail

873
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,240
on the wrist.

874
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,040
It looks like

875
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,240
the letter Y.

876
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,080
I checked

877
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,600
Tan's social relations,

878
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,040
but got nothing about this man.

879
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,720
But I'm certain

880
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,680
that he's involved in Peng's disappearance.

881
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,480
Keep an eye on him when

882
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,600
under Feng Guangyun.

883
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,520
Got it.

884
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,400
How have you been lately?

885
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,240
Not bad.

886
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,160
I didn't engage in espionage,

887
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,200
but I served in the police for five years.

888
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,840
I know what I should do.

889
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,560
Have a sense of proportion.

890
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,200
If Feng pushed you hard

891
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,640
on purpose,

892
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,840
you shouldn't bear it too much.

893
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,080
That's different from you before.

894
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,640
Otherwise,

895
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
he'd think you're up to something.

896
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,800
No worries.

897
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,680
I'll do Chen Hao's

898
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,840
character setting well.

899
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,200
Do you remember how to say

900
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,160
"meet" in French?

901
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,640
Rencontre.

902
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Rencontre.

903
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,200
Do you know

904
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,960
why you're not

905
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,480
sent to pick up Mrs. Peng?

906
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,680
Because you met Xiang Yuansheng,

907
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,680
the situation would be more complex.

908
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,800
Take the pistol.

909
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,080
I hope you'll never pull the trigger.

910
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,000
He must think

911
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm working for Feng Guangyun.

912
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,120
Keep the Fourth Station and him

913
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,720
as far as possible.

914
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,280
Who is eating

915
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,320
with Mr. Tan?

916
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,200
I have no idea

917
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,120
who it is.

918
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,160
[I heard he's from Nanjing.]

919
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,040
Really?

920
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,600
[Attention!]

921
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,040
[Two men in a group]

922
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,080
[on patrol]

923
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,360
[for each and every inch.]

924
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,320
[Do it now.]

925
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,000
Yes, sir.

926
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,800
[Come on.]

927
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,480
[Let's]

928
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,600
[propose a toast to Mr. Hua.]

929
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,400
[Cheers.]

930
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:11,960
[To Mr. Hua.]

931
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,320
[Mr. Hua]

932
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,560
[is a busy man.]

933
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,600
[Yes.]

934
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,000
[Let's drink up.]

935
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,360
[You're afar from Nanjing.]

936
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,680
[It's our great honor to meet you.]

937
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,120
[This is Xiang Yuansheng's]

938
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,560
[elder brother.]

939
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,560
[He came]

940
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,840
[specifically from Nanjing.]

941
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,320
[Nice to meet you.]

942
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,280
[Mr. Hua.]

943
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,080
[Captain Chen,]

944
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,440
[thanks for your kindness.]

945
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,760
[I'm certain]

946
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,040
[that he's]

947
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,880
[involved in]

948
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,960
[Peng's disappearance.]
