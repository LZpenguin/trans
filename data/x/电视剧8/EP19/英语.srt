Shooting Stars EP19

3
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,360
If you can

4
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,640
achieve more results

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
by the end of the year,

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,280
we may be able to

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,000
work together at the Supervision Office

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,960
next year.

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,440
Thank you, I...

10
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,120
Where is the deserter from the 32nd Army?

11
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm here to make a deal with you.

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,960
This confession

13
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,760
needs a thumbprint.

14
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
If you can get it done tonight,

15
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,680
I'll arrange

16
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,200
your bail.

17
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
Once out of jail,

18
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,880
you're free.

19
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,800
Whose thumbprint?

20
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
Mr. Hua, right?

21
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,720
Do me a favor, please.

22
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,320
It's simple.

23
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
Just a thumbprint.

24
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,400
What if I refuse it?

25
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
He's still breathing.

26
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,920
Captain.

27
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
He's strangled unconscious by Hua Zhen

28
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,040
and hasn't woken up.

29
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,440
How did things go with the guards?

30
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,360
They're required to keep

31
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,440
the mouth shut.

32
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
Just bury him here.

33
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Bury?

34
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,720
What?

35
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,320
He's not the first to be buried here.

36
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,320
But...

37
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
he's just unconscious.

38
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,720
He's a deserter.

39
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
Who would care about him?

40
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Is this Mr. Wan?

41
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
Hello,

42
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,040
this is Wei Dai...

43
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,720
actually, Wei Fulai.

44
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm wondering

45
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,040
if you're still

46
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
working in the archives at the

47
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Army University.

48
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,160
That's great.

49
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,200
I need a favor from you.

50
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,960
You have

51
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,640
a student named Hua Zhen

52
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,520
at the regular class.

53
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Could you

54
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,880
get me a copy

55
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,120
of his ID photo?

56
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,920
In his

57
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,000
casual clothes.

58
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Rest assured.

59
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,920
I won't

60
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,880
shortchange you

61
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,480
on the payment.

62
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
But be quick.

63
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
Thank you so much.

64
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,080
The organization

65
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
made an exception to confirm

66
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,400
that Xiang Yuansheng doesn't belong to us.

67
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,120
Are you sure?

68
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,520
He's not.

69
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,840
What kind of evidence

70
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,520
does Wei Daiqing hold then?

71
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,520
Or

72
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
is he deliberately

73
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
misidentifying Yuansheng?

74
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,120
My biggest concern now

75
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,400
is that Runjin's situation

76
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,720
might be linked to him.

77
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,000
At that time, you didn't know

78
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Runjin was our man.

79
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,520
Xiang Yuansheng used his belt

80
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,280
to stop the bleeding

81
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,520
on Runjin's leg.

82
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,520
But up till now,

83
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,240
I still haven't

84
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,520
found Runjin.

85
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
If he's

86
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,360
taken away

87
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,880
by Wei Daiqing,

88
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,120
the belt could likely

89
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,280
be used as evidence.

90
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,240
Yes,

91
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,040
but just as evidence.

92
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,360
After all,

93
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
Xiang Yuansheng is not one of us.

94
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,520
Keeping a distance from him

95
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,880
is the best protection.

96
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,640
This can

97
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,080
prevent Wei Daiqing from finding

98
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,560
anything substantial against him.

99
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,360
So, do not

100
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,880
act until

101
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,320
Wei Daiqing

102
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
shows his hand.

103
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,760
Understood.

104
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
Hua Liang visited the Fourth Station.

105
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,760
He said that was a casual visit,

106
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
but I know

107
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
it's impossible.

108
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,640
If there's anything

109
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
the Fourth Station can assist with,

110
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,040
may I?

111
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,680
Would that be a breach of discipline?

112
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,840
Not at all.

113
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,760
Regarding Xiang Yuansheng,

114
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,200
we're not different from

115
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,240
what Hua Liang wanna do.

116
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,400
Thank you.

117
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,520
You should go back.

118
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,880
I'll confirm a new meeting point

119
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,120
as soon as possible.

120
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,520
Alright.

121
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,680
You know what Wei Daiqing did.

122
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,680
He's gonna be dismissed.

123
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,880
Even if the Shanghai Garrison Command

124
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,120
is governed by the Ministry of Military Affairs,

125
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,480
there're other departments

126
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,840
and many generals in Nanjing

127
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,640
besides your father.

128
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
I believe that Captain Wei

129
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,520
can strike a balance.

130
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,400
Of course he can.

131
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
But how about you?

132
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,280
Your police girlfriend

133
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
has been released.

134
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,320
While detained here,

135
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,240
I didn't trouble her

136
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,520
or disturb her family.

137
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,720
Come in.

138
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Captain, I'm coming.

139
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
Close the door.

140
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
Listen, find the landlady

141
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,360
who

142
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
provided us tips

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,840
in Guangzhou,

144
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,280
and keep her silenced permanently.

145
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,480
Clear?

146
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,520
Got it.

147
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,200
Do your best.

148
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,560
I have higher hopes for you

149
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,200
than Gao Pingshun.

150
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,440
Yes, sir.

151
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Zhang Runjin

152
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,280
is a member of

153
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,320
the CPC under Deng Mingyuan.

154
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,440
I've tracked him

155
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,240
from Guangzhou

156
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,520
all the way to Shanghai.

157
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,320
This belt

158
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,800
was

159
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,280
taken off from his leg

160
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,040
when he's arrested.

161
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,080
He's stabbed with a dagger.

162
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,400
And someone

163
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,320
used the belt

164
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,760
to stop the bleeding.

165
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,680
Seeing

166
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
the word inside,

167
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,520
I suspect it's from Li Shunchang's store

168
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,760
in Nanjing.

169
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,320
So I personally went there

170
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,600
and found out

171
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,840
that it's bought by Hua Zhen's mother

172
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,800
for him.

173
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,760
This

174
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,680
is the testimony and the receipt

175
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
from the store owner.

176
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,000
The belt can fully prove that

177
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hua Zhen is connected

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,520
to the CPC.

179
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,040
That's when I started

180
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,800
suspecting him.

181
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,880
Mr. Hua,

182
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,680
care to explain?

183
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,560
Why you helped

184
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,600
that Communist?

185
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,920
That gentleman

186
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,680
protected a girl

187
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,320
living with me at the time

188
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
and was injured as a result.

189
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,480
So I felt that

190
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,080
any help

191
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,720
I offered

192
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
was merely human decency.

193
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
I didn't know him

194
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,320
or that

195
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,840
he was a Communist.

196
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,000
You didn't know him?

197
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
You're saying

198
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
Zhang Runjin was secretly

199
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,480
protecting the girl?

200
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
Indeed, he was.

201
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
The girl he referred to

202
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
is Meng Duoci.

203
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,240
Her parents

204
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,600
were closely tied with the CPC.

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,040
Zhang Runjin

206
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,080
was obviously sent by the CPC

207
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,160
to protect her.

208
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,960
That's why he never

209
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,400
dared to appear in the public.

210
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,280
What about you, Mr. Hua?

211
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,400
If you're not with the CPC,

212
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,720
why did you

213
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,120
take in Meng Duoci?

214
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,840
The day I arrived in Shanghai,

215
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,360
I intended to stay at Van Hwa Hotel

216
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
but stumbled upon a murder scene.

217
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,720
Meng Duoci sought my help.

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,120
Out of sympathy,

219
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,760
and since

220
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,160
I had a month's vacation,

221
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
I agreed to stay

222
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,960
and help her find the killer.

223
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,640
She didn't know you.

224
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,160
But facing trouble,

225
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
why did she turn to you as a stranger

226
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,360
for help instead of the police,

227
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,600
or report the case?

228
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,440
Because she saw the killer

229
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,640
wearing a police uniform.

230
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,640
She didn't trust the police.

231
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,560
So,

232
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
you just

233
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,640
happened

234
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,800
to encounter Meng Duoci

235
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,680
in a dire situation,

236
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,640
and happened

237
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,880
to save Zhang Runjin with severe injuries.

238
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,320
How then do you explain

239
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,400
using the alias "Xiang Yuansheng"?

240
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,040
There're 3 victims

241
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,320
at Van Hwa Hotel,

242
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,920
including Duoci's parents

243
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,600
and a young man.

244
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,600
The household card for Xiang Yuansheng

245
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,520
was taken from him.

246
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
My family wouldn't agree with me

247
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
investigating cases in Shanghai.

248
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,440
If I used my real name

249
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,080
as a police officer,

250
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,600
they'd have known by the next day.

251
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,280
So, I used

252
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,000
that household card.

253
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,680
The photo

254
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,760
was also tore off

255
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,880
from the card.

256
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,200
Captain Wei.

257
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,320
Is the deceased Hua Zhen mentioned

258
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,520
He Youqing?

259
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,080
He Youqing.

260
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,240
The third victim at Van Hwa Hotel.

261
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,560
Unfortunately,

262
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,760
also

263
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,600
a Communist.

264
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,240
Is there any problem

265
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,520
with what he's saying now?

266
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,880
The alias Xiang Yuansheng

267
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,920
was prepared by the CPC

268
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,480
for He Youqing.

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,040
He died.

270
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,600
Hua Zhen picked up this identity

271
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
from him

272
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,040
and used it.

273
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,000
His statement

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,320
has no problems

275
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,160
although slightly flawed.

276
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,720
Since Meng Duoci has disappeared

277
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,920
and He Youqing is dead,

278
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,400
no one can prove his story

279
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
true or false.

280
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,760
At least it sounds reasonable.

281
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,800
But,

282
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,600
in Guangzhou,

283
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,480
I found these documents

284
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,920
in an apartment rented by Zhang Runjin

285
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,120
for the Mengs.

286
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,520
A month ago,

287
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,760
Zhang had rented

288
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
an apartment in Guangzhou for the Meng family.

289
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,680
I found these documents

290
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,320
in the apartment.

291
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,560
The CPC's plan

292
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,000
was originally to relocate

293
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,720
the Mengs to Guangzhou,

294
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,520
where they had rented a new house

295
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,600
and arranged new identity documents

296
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,240
and even new jobs.

297
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,800
One of the documents

298
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,840
read

299
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,240
"Xiang Yuansheng",

300
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,040
with a photo of Hua Zhen himself.

301
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,120
If

302
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
he is not a Communist,

303
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,440
why would he be included

304
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,600
in the plan?

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,040
That day

306
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,320
in Nanjing

307
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,440
when I went to arrest Deng Mingyuan,

308
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,920
I personally saw

309
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,040
Hua Zhen talking

310
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,600
with him in a room.

311
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,880
The next day,

312
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,240
Hua Zhen hurried to Shanghai.

313
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,520
Why?

314
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,760
Because he wasn't

315
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,160
just going on a trip.

316
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,120
He was on a mission.

317
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,320
He didn't just

318
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,240
find the documents

319
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,600
on He Youqing.

320
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,360
But the new identity

321
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,800
was exactly prepared for him!

322
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,080
He is the Communist sent by

323
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,560
Deng Mingyuan!

324
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,720
Hua Zhen.

325
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
How do you explain this document?

326
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,240
My mom doesn't even remember

327
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,840
making a belt

328
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,680
for Hua Zhen at that store.

329
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,480
I request

330
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,920
a delay in the interrogation.

331
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,720
I need time

332
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,960
to verify this evidence.

333
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,560
Set aside the belt for now.

334
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,240
But what about the final document?

335
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,240
It's incriminating.

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,480
Regarding this,

337
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,120
we truly have no evidence

338
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,160
to refute it.

339
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,240
Nor can I admit to it.

340
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,280
But if other evidence

341
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,040
is flawed,

342
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,200
you must give me time

343
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,480
to verify it, right?

344
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,480
It's not

345
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,920
an official trial yet.

346
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,560
Hua Zhen must not be

347
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,800
brought to the military court in Nanjing.

348
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,840
But during the hearing,

349
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,640
he's already admitted

350
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,600
the belt was his.

351
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,320
Denying it now

352
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,600
seems quite far-fetched.

353
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,720
My dad sent me here

354
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
not to ascertain

355
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
who owns this belt.

356
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,040
It's irrelevant.

357
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,520
But I must bring Hua Zhen

358
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,240
back to home.

359
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,960
Besides, Uncle Tong.

360
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,520
My dad wouldn't want Hua Zhen

361
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,320
to get into trouble on your turf,

362
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,040
right?

363
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,200
How much time do you need?

364
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,400
Three days.

365
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,920
Hua Liang.

366
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,040
I understand you're fighting for time.

367
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
We can help

368
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
your family

369
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,040
at the hearing,

370
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,480
but that's as far as it goes.

371
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,520
At this point,

372
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,480
no one will dare

373
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,240
to vouch for Hua Zhen

374
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,600
without

375
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,760
implicating themselves.

376
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,080
I understand.

377
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,320
But no matter what,

378
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,400
I'll do everything possible

379
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,960
for my brother.

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,680
Sorry,

381
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,520
but

382
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
I really can't let you in.

383
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
My son is an officer here!

384
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,960
An officer?

385
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,640
Yes.

386
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,200
What's his name?

387
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,000
Wei Fulai.

388
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,000
Wei Fulai?

389
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,040
Captain,

390
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,080
do you know them at the entrance?

391
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,040
No.

392
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,680
Fulai...

393
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,120
Didn't we agree

394
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,000
you'd call ahead?

395
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,800
Your mom really wanted to see you.

396
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,680
That's fine.

397
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,480
Just don't show up

398
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,520
unannounced next time,

399
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,680
okay?

400
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,680
This is the liquor

401
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,080
your dad brought from home.

402
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,280
It's your favorite from

403
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,520
when you were in Liling.

404
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,880
Want to have a couple of drinks

405
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,280
with your dad?

406
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
I don't usually drink.

407
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,840
I don't have the glasses for it.

408
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,680
Aren't there a few there?

409
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,480
Those

410
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,520
are for drinking coffee, Shanghai style.

411
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,440
Fulai,

412
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,200
your mom and I

413
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,800
came from Liling mainly because

414
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
we're worried

415
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
you're not adjusting well.

416
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,240
I've been here a year.

417
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,840
I'm the Captain of the

418
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,680
investigation team.

419
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,280
I've adjusted fine.

420
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,320
But

421
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,200
you were transferred

422
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,440
from elsewhere.

423
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,920
You're not one of their own.

424
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,120
I don't need

425
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,320
to be that.

426
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,800
To be honest,

427
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
I look down on most of them,

428
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,880
especially those who climb the ranks

429
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,720
through background.

430
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,400
I'm smarter

431
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,720
than most of them,

432
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,840
and I know it.

433
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,840
What I lack

434
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
is merely the background

435
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,120
they possess.

436
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,800
Are you still bitter

437
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,320
about the Army Department incident?

438
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,560
Not bitter,

439
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
just dissatisfied.

440
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,520
I've passed the exam

441
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,960
for the Ministry of Military Affairs.

442
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,600
But a bureaucrat's son

443
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,680
has taken my spot by dark box operation,

444
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,640
sending me

445
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,680
to that unfortunate post in Nanchang.

446
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
The airfield fire happened,

447
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
dissolving the investigation department.

448
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,920
Lieutenant Colonel,

449
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,400
the promised rank,

450
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,120
has gone.

451
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,320
You factory workers

452
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,640
can't comprehend these.

453
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,920
Don't offer me

454
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,120
advice anymore.

455
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,960
Fulai,

456
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,280
we're buying tickets

457
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,640
to go back tomorrow.

458
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,920
If not necessary,

459
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,600
we won't come again.

460
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,360
Dad,

461
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
I've changed my name.

462
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,560
Next time when you call,

463
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,120
remember

464
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,560
I'm not Wei Fulai,

465
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,560
but Wei Daiqing.

466
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,520
Sir, have you

467
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,000
bought our products?

468
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,400
Heard of the brand.

469
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,800
What type

470
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,840
of shoes do you need?

471
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,040
I can recommend some.

472
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm...

473
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,320
just looking around.

474
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,120
It doesn't work.

475
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
You need to try them on.

476
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,800
Our shoes

477
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,400
are imported from Paris,

478
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,840
patronized

479
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,120
by the

480
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,040
elite and

481
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,640
high society there.

482
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,720
The pair you're holding

483
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,120
is made from premium calf leather,

484
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,960
so the price is...

485
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,040
I didn't ask about it.

486
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,720
I want this material,

487
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,000
but the style

488
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,160
should be more subdued.

489
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,480
It doesn't

490
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,400
fit where

491
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,040
I'm going otherwise.

492
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,120
Let me find you

493
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,880
a classic pair

494
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
to try on.

495
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,400
Pingshun!

496
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,160
What's your shoe size?

497
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,120
About the same as yours.

498
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,440
Perfect.

499
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,720
This pair has been with me for 3 years.

500
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,840
Now they're yours!

501
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,280
You

502
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,000
don't like them?

503
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,880
Thank you.

504
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Any news

505
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
from Mr. Hua Liang

506
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,240
lately?

507
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,200
The guys tailing him

508
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,600
haven't reported anything.

509
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,920
He should still be in the hotel.

510
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,120
I'll check on him later.

511
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
He just wanna

512
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,760
make a fuss over the belt.

513
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,480
Alright,

514
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,320
I've already requested

515
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
surveillance on him.

516
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,240
Even if he knows

517
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
you're monitoring,

518
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
it doesn't matter.

519
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,200
Keep me updated

520
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,600
on his meetings.

521
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
Has the belt store owner from Nanjing

522
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,320
boarded the train yet?

523
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,560
On his way.

524
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,680
Mr. Hua,

525
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,480
should we deal with the people

526
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,840
from the investigation at the door?

527
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,160
They have

528
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,840
permission from the review committee.

529
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,160
Don't ask for trouble on our own.

530
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,160
But they...

531
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,480
I know.

532
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,680
After they know

533
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,080
what I wanna do,

534
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,000
Wei Daiqing will come to me.

535
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,840
Let's give him that chance.

536
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,720
Do you

537
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
have a plan?

538
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,600
Once the store owner

539
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,480
arrives,

540
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,000
tell him to meet me in the cafe

541
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,880
on the first floor.

542
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,480
Right under their noses?

543
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,960
Yes, absolutely.

544
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Go ask them

545
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,400
if they'd like to join me for lunch.

546
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
Mr. Hua would like to invite you

547
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,080
to join him for lunch.

548
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,480
Are you available?

549
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,160
I appreciate it.

550
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,680
But no need.

551
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,160
Please tell him

552
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,160
that we're here

553
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,640
on official duty.

554
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,280
If any inconvenience,

555
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,160
we apologize.

556
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,960
Pingshun,

557
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
someone's out.

558
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,520
Is it Mr. Hua?

559
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,720
No.

560
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,800
Go to sleep. I'll keep watch.

561
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,800
Who is it?

562
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,320
Captain Chen.

563
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,560
Mr. Hua?

564
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,840
What brings you here?

565
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,840
Sorry for disturbing you so late.

566
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,040
Here's the thing,

567
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,600
last time you mentioned

568
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,560
that I can come to you

569
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,120
if in need of help.

570
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,840
Is Hua Zhen in trouble?

571
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,560
Not at the moment.

572
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,840
But I do

573
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,960
have a favor to ask.

574
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,280
Excuse me.

575
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,600
Mr. Li.

576
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,040
Have a seat.

577
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:45,960
Please.

578
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Thank you.

579
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,480
How was

580
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,840
your journey here?

581
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,360
Good.

582
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,480
We've met before in Nanjing.

583
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,800
Indeed.

584
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,280
Who in Nanjing

585
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,240
doesn't

586
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,160
know Mr. Hua?

587
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
I invited you mainly

588
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,560
because of

589
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,880
my brother's situation.

590
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,720
Mr. Hua!

591
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,320
He...

592
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,160
Sorry to bother.

593
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,160
Captain Wei,

594
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,520
join us

595
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,920
in coffee?

596
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,440
Mr. Hua,

597
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,360
I've

598
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,880
applied to the provisional

599
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,240
military tribunal

600
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,240
for restrictions on you.

601
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,040
You shouldn't

602
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,160
meet anyone

603
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,000
involved

604
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,840
in the case before the hearing.

605
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,120
He's my guest.

606
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,040
Mr. Li?

607
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,400
He is our witness.

608
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,880
You know

609
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,520
this isn't

610
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,880
a real trial.

611
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,480
Stop playing games with me.

612
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,760
How about

613
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,760
negotiating

614
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,160
with the investigation team?

615
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
If you can persuade Hua Zhen

616
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,200
to put his fingerprint

617
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,840
on the confession

618
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,920
stating

619
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,840
he's a

620
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,360
compatriot

621
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,200
of Deng Mingyuan,

622
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,320
I can immediately

623
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,960
request the tribunal

624
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,880
to classify him

625
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
as a regular political prisoner.

626
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,880
Mr. Hua,

627
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
you have one day

628
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,120
to think about it...

629
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,480
Thank you,

630
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,040
but I don't need a day.

631
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,120
I can tell you now.

632
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,880
You won't get anything from me.

633
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,000
Wait...

634
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,800
Mr. Hua!

635
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,760
What happened?

636
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,200
Captain Wei.

637
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,600
Not only will you

638
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,920
get nothing,

639
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,480
but you also need

640
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,240
to reimburse Mr. Li's train fare

641
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,560
from Nanjing to Shanghai.

10642
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,360
Not a penny less.

643
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,720
Stop here.

644
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,760
Just stay at the door.

645
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,760
Here.

646
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,560
You've asked for 3 days.

647
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,160
How's it going?

648
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,080
Any progress?

649
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,440
Going through all this trouble

650
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,440
to get a fingerprint,

651
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,080
you must be desperate.

652
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,760
Where would you find such a person?

653
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,000
Even if

654
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,320
you searched each and every

655
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,240
cell here,

656
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,040
you couldn't find anyone willing.

657
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
Mr. Hua,

658
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,280
I consider myself

659
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,040
a hard worker,

660
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
but I've realized

661
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,080
something over the years.

662
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,400
Success doesn't just

663
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,920
come from efforts,

664
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,600
it's about seizing the moment.

665
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,040
I have to say,

666
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
the advantage this time

667
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,680
is mine.

668
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,920
How's Zhang Runjin?

669
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,600
Gosh.

670
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,960
You finally admit

671
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,360
that he's your comrade?

672
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,640
Where is he now?

673
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,120
Honestly,

674
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,560
I admire him.

675
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,440
He got himself seriously injured

676
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,920
protecting a little girl.

677
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,320
But I'm also grateful.

678
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,600
Without him,

679
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,560
I wouldn't have found you.

680
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,360
Oh yes,

681
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,480
from the detention center,

682
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
head west

683
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,000
down a small path.

684
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,320
Continue along that path

685
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,920
all the way

686
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,720
beyond Puhuitang,

687
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,440
and you'll find a wasteland.

688
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,320
Dig down three feet,

689
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,800
and that's where he is.

690
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,000
Probably reeking by now.

691
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,240
You're luckier than him,

692
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,120
you know?

693
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,880
People are

694
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,560
always watching you!

695
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,880
Why?

696
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,120
If it weren't

697
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,000
for the name Hua Zhen,

698
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,240
you'd just be

699
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,480
another hole

700
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,000
in that wasteland.

701
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,560
Everyone.

702
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,720
This is

703
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,560
the second interrogation session.

704
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,440
Due to Mr. Hua's

705
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,600
objections

706
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,800
on the belt,

707
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,760
requesting verification,

708
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,200
we

709
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
granted a three-day extension.

710
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,600
Mr. Hua.

711
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,560
How about your verification?

712
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,760
I'm sorry

713
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,520
for the delay,

714
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,120
and thank you all for your patience.

715
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,560
My mother

716
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,800
spent two full days searching our home

717
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,000
but couldn't find the receipt

718
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,680
for this belt.

719
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Do you have the receipt?

720
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,880
No.

721
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,920
We have 3 men in our family.

722
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,240
My mother shops at different stores

723
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,120
for our belts.

724
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,840
Sorry to interrupt.

725
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,080
But the word

726
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,120
"Shunchang"

727
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,000
inside the belt

728
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,240
has served as conclusive evidence.

729
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,760
I explained this

730
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,120
during the last trial.

731
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,400
Have you

732
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,280
forgotten?
