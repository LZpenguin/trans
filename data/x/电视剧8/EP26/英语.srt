Shooting Stars EP26

3
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,600
Stop!

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,480
Halt!

5
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,640
Hurry!

6
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,160
Stop!

7
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,040
You stop!

8
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,160
Halt!

9
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,560
Mr. Feng.

10
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,000
Why is he here?

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,800
What's going on over there?

12
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,760
Just now, a man came to

13
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,599
the place we arrest the journalist

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,680
and kidnapped him.

15
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,320
Who did it?

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,960
That guy made a mess

17
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,000
over there,

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,400
so we didn't see who it was.

19
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Mr. Feng,

20
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,040
no one is there.

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,160
Mr. Feng, how about letting me go in and get...

22
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,880
Buzz off!

23
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,760
Hello, Sir. How many?

24
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,000
Mrs. Peng.

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,920
Come in quickly.

26
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,920
How's the journey?

27
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,400
Smooth.

28
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,120
And you?

29
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,760
Did Feng Guangyun jerk you around?

30
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,160
No.

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
Where is Journalist Peng?

32
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,560
In the room.

33
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,000
Hasn't regained his consciousness,

34
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,520
not yet recovered.

35
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,520
When I saved him,

36
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,760
he's already been in a coma

37
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,440
with wounds all over his body.

38
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Feng Guangyun's subordinates

39
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,920
tortured him severely

40
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,560
and repeatedly.

41
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,560
During this period,

42
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
they tortured him again and again.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,840
It's hard to imagine

44
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,560
how he managed to hold on.

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Can we take him to the hospital?

46
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,400
No, we can't.

47
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,160
The police will know as soon as we go there.

48
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
As for the treatment,

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,560
you don't need to worry.

50
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,760
Journalist Peng is a member of the NSO.

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,920
We have arranged

52
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,960
to send him

53
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,160
to the clinic of the NSO.

54
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Now, I just hope

55
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
Journalist Peng can recover as soon as possible.

56
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
Thank you so much.

57
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,960
The NSO has also

58
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,160
arranged a friend

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
to take care of us

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,400
and bring us some food and materials,

61
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
so that I don't have to go out.

62
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,320
Is that person reliable?

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,320
Yes,

64
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,320
she helped me get through,

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,520
and she's kind to me.

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,760
Don't worry.

67
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,880
Once Peng regains consciousness,

68
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,160
we could know

69
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,720
what happened

70
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
during this time period.

71
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,400
Captain,

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
does that mean we can conclude

73
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,280
the case of Mr. Peng?

74
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
I don't know what could happen

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,400
in the future,

76
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,880
but at least the missing case of Journalist Peng

77
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
is over.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
Can we wait for

79
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,200
Journalist Peng to wake up

80
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
before

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,040
disbanding our group of three?

82
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,160
I made an appointment

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,400
with Xiang Yuansheng before.

84
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,200
Our cooperation ends

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
as soon as we find Peng.

86
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,680
Peng is still unconscious.

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,040
I've not gotten even a word

88
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,280
of the answer I want.

89
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
Our cooperation cannot end here.

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,320
OK,

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,040
let's wait until Peng wakes up.

92
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Agree.

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,560
Mr. Luo.

94
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,560
Minmin,

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
everyone has arrived home except you.

96
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,640
Thank you for seeing me home.

97
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm going back now.

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,280
Mr. Xiang...

99
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,160
It's time to go home.

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
There is soup on the stove.

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,280
You each drink a bowl before going to bed.

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
Mr. Hua,

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
I really appreciate

104
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
your help.

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,080
But the next time

106
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
Minmin comes back late,

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
her brother and I will take her home.

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,760
I don't want to bother you.

109
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
It doesn't matter,

110
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
and I'm just on the way.

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
Now public order is not very good,

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,400
so you hurry home.

113
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,040
You two,

114
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
back to your rooms.

115
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,040
When did he come back?

116
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,560
A few days

117
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
ago.

118
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,000
I found you ask a leave

119
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
but didn't return to the shop to help,

120
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,480
so I guessed that.

121
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,960
Minmin,

122
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,000
you didn't get the letter.

10123
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,480
It doesn't matter

124
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
why he didn't write,

125
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
even if he did,

126
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,040
it also doesn't matter.

127
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
What matters is that

128
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,920
you cannot get his letter.

129
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,440
Understand?

130
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,440
This will be a main problem

131
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,560
for both of you.

132
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
He always disappears

133
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,320
from your life

134
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
for one reason or another,

135
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,200
without any message.

136
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,120
It's unfair for you.

137
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,320
How long is he staying

138
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,760
in Shanghai this time?

139
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,240
A week,

140
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,000
a week to fulfill the mission,

141
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,560
and then he'll go back.

142
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,280
Minmin,

143
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,280
since you will lose contact with him,

144
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
don't rekindle the flame.

145
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,040
Why are you here?

146
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,680
No matter what

147
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,040
dad just told you,

148
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
I support your decision.

149
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,440
I shouldn't have

150
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,600
kept the journalist alive.

151
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,400
When he refused to tell me

152
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,560
where the negatives are,

153
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,440
I should have asked Zhou Chang

154
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,560
to kill him.

155
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,440
Sir,

156
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,600
I can now confirm that

157
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,120
Hua Zhen's cohorts are a man and a woman.

158
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,680
In the hospital of the Shipyard,

159
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,280
the woman accompanied the journalist's wife.

160
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,760
And the man

161
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,800
rescued the journalist.

162
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,880
But when my men

163
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,640
chased out,

164
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
they viewed only the sight of their back,

165
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,800
and failed to view their faces.

166
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
I've hired Zhou Chang for so long,

167
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
but he didn't even

168
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,240
have the slightest vigilance,

169
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,960
taking so many people to catch a woman.

170
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,440
I was indeed too careless

171
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,600
for this matter,

172
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,560
but shouldn't Hua...

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,040
his elder brother

174
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,600
give us an explanation?

175
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,560
He came to Shanghai that day

176
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,640
and clearly promised to discipline his...

177
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,320
I'm in the photo.

178
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,360
You know how much trouble it would be for me

179
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
if that journalist ran away.

180
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
Sir,

181
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,000
Hua Zhen was there.

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,840
I couldn't do anything

183
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,280
when he wanted to block me.

184
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,040
He just had a cup of coffee,

185
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,000
that's all, right?

186
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
We all know he was pretending.

187
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,560
Where's the evidence?

188
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,120
If you can give me

189
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,880
even a shred of evidence,

190
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,840
I can call

191
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,800
Hua Liang directly.

192
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,920
But till now,

193
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,640
you only know Hua Zhen had a cup of coffee.

194
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,960
As for this matter,

195
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,640
we have to deal with it ourselves.

196
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,840
If Nakamura and Hua Liang know that,

197
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,640
you and I are hard to explain.

198
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,560
But sir,

199
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,640
will we just let it go?

200
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,040
If Hua Zhen

201
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,480
isn't Hua Liang's brother,

202
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,160
it wouldn't have been so difficult at all.

203
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,960
I just shot him

204
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,400
and all problems are gone.

205
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,880
As I said before,

206
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,800
if Hua Liang can discipline

207
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,920
his brother,

208
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,720
this is his family affairs.

209
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,440
But if he can't,

210
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,920
then we have to

211
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,160
discipline for him.

212
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,720
Do you mean...?

213
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,320
Do it your way.

214
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,320
You have my back,

215
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,320
and Nakamura

216
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,960
supports me.

217
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,240
I understand.

218
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,200
You just said

219
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,640
Hua Zhen's cohorts are a man and a woman.

220
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,240
It should be easy to find out

221
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,320
the man and woman who can contact

222
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,600
with him in Shanghai, right?

223
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,240
A man and a woman...

224
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
It's easy.

225
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,840
Not difficult.

226
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,080
Don't worry,

227
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,080
I can do it.

228
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,560
Mr. Feng.

229
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Mr. Feng.

230
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,360
Mr. Feng.

231
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
Where is Chen Hao?

232
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,400
Today is Sunday,

233
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,080
so all staff are on holiday,

234
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,240
just the two of us on duty.

235
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Did he come here yesterday?

236
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,080
Yes, he did.

237
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
He stayed here the whole time yesterday?

238
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
He went out with us

239
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,840
at noon yesterday.

240
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,760
It was our turn

241
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,800
to go out for patrol.

242
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,840
Did he ever leave alone

243
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,280
on patrol?

244
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,280
We spread out during the patrol,

245
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,320
one for a piece of area.

246
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,200
And then I haven't seen him.

247
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,760
Have you seen him with anyone

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,880
from the Fourth Station recently?

249
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,400
No, Sir.

250
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,000
Give me the files

251
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,640
of the Fourth Station.

252
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,160
Yes, sir.

253
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,480
Good Morning.

254
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,520
Good night.

255
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,880
Good Morning.

256
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Good Morning.

257
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,080
Good night.

258
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,680
Good night.

259
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,600
I haven't locked my door yet.

260
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,840
What's up?

261
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Dongbao is in trouble.

262
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,400
What's the matter?

263
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,760
He fainted at the dock.

264
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,840
How could it be?

265
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,160
Does his wound relapse?

266
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
I don't know.

267
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,840
Xiang Yuansheng and Erbai

268
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,040
just sent him to the hospital.

269
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,400
How could it be so serious?

270
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,840
I don't know.

271
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Why don't you visit him yourself?

272
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,840
You tell me first.

273
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,320
I really can't say it clearly.

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,120
If you don't go,

275
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,480
you will regret.

276
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,640
Let's go, Captain.

277
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,160
Hongfa.

278
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,160
Hongfa.

279
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,800
The car is coming.

280
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,080
Get off.

281
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,840
Well, you've already arrived.

282
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Get off the car.

283
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,320
You said

284
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,240
something happened to Dongbao, right?

285
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,160
Then why bring me to the Fourth Station?

286
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
You'll know when you get in.

287
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,160
Don't ask me.

288
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,840
Hongfa.

289
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,160
See, who's here?

290
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,080
Captain.

291
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Dongbao, are you alright?

292
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm all right, captain.

293
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,880
That's great.

294
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,760
That's great.

295
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,560
Yu, long time no see.

296
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,160
How are you?

297
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
I'm good.

298
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,680
See, I'm smart, right?

299
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,800
I bring the Captain here,

300
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,600
and you can't do this.

301
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,120
Yes, you're smart.

302
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,080
You guys go ahead,

303
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,600
and I'll talk to Xiang Yuansheng.

304
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,040
OK, hurry up.

305
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,400
It's almost done.

306
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
If you sit down, we can eat.

307
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,680
OK.

308
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,600
Why are you here?

309
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
I know what you're worried about.

310
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm also called over.

311
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,560
As for the incident yesterday,

312
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,840
Feng Guangyun will definitely investigate.

313
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,320
It's too dangerous that

314
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,520
we meet here.

315
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm leaving now.

316
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,560
Have you finished?

317
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,400
Come here and sit down.

318
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,400
Ronghua,

319
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,280
I have something to do

320
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,240
at Shiliupu Police Station.

321
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,080
Bye, enjoy the meal.

322
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,840
Captain,

323
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
well,

324
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,680
please forget

325
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,360
what I said last time.

326
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
Don't you understand me?

327
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
I said that without thinking seriously.

328
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,400
I didn't mean it.

329
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,520
I've known you for so many years,

330
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,080
so I definitely understand you,

331
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,400
It's okay, and I didn't take it in mind.

332
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Today, I want to

333
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,120
take the opportunity

334
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,200
to be honest with you.

335
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,560
I do want to have less contact

336
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,640
with the Fourth Station.

337
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,600
Because I am still a policeman.

338
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,680
Being a cop means trouble will find you.

339
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,920
You used to be a cop,

340
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,240
so you must understand this.

341
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,600
Now you all

342
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,240
have your own lives,

343
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,360
and I don't want to

344
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,600
bring my troubles to you.

345
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,440
I hope you can understand.

346
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,240
Erbai, I'm leaving.

347
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,920
Where are you go?

348
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,480
Are we those who scare trouble?

349
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Who's afraid of trouble?

350
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,960
We've never been afraid of trouble.

351
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,400
Captain,

352
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,120
We Fourth Station have finally come together.

353
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,920
If you leave,

354
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,160
it's not our Fourth Station.

355
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,320
I spent so much time bringing you here,

356
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,240
now you want to leave.

357
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,360
Can you stay a little longer

358
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,160
just once?

359
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,320
That's enough.

360
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,960
You brat,

361
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,920
I've always said

362
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,360
the Fourth Station

363
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
is a big family.

364
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,520
If you really regard it

365
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,080
as one of your own homes,

366
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,320
just stay and gather with us.

367
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,080
If you want to

368
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,480
gather with us later, just come here.

369
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,560
And if you don't,

370
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
you just live your life,

371
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,080
and we live our lives.

372
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Is it OK?

373
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,920
Enough,

374
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,160
just follow the director today.

375
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,880
I'll stand by your side and watch you

376
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,120
Yuansheng, stop working.

377
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,680
Come on.

378
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,360
You can't run away.

379
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,920
Open the pot.

380
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,840
It smells good.

381
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
The liquor has been poured.

382
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,560
Come.

383
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,920
Come here, Yu.

384
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,840
Sit down, Erbai.

385
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,200
Coming.

386
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,920
Rare occasion.

387
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,440
Indeed a hard-won occasion.

388
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,680
Long time has passed since the last time

389
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,760
all Fourth Station members gathered.

390
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
The first toast

391
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,840
to Dongbao and Yu.

392
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,680
Dongbao has big news to announce.

393
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,000
Why are you so happy?

394
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Say it.

395
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,720
What's up?

396
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,240
I tell you a happy event.

397
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
I'm going to be a father.

398
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,240
Good news, isn't it?

399
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,960
Yu.

400
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,600
you're going to be a mother.

401
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,240
Let's have a toast.

402
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,280
Cheers.

403
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,360
To Dongbao.

404
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,000
Yu,

405
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,760
congratulations.

406
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,840
No wine for Yu.

407
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,400
Drink some tea instead.

408
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,200
Glad to hear that.

409
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,440
When did you find it?

410
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Just recently.

411
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,000
Captain,

412
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,120
I got a job

413
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,920
at the dock.

414
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Yu used to watch over

415
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,960
and clean

416
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
a warehouse.

417
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,000
Now that she's pregnant,

10418
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,120
I got a job

419
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,440
at the warehouse.

420
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,160
During the day, I work as a porter.

421
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
At night, I work as a warehouse keeper.

422
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,680
I can accompany her.

423
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,960
And I get paid twice.

424
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,520
So, you don't have to

425
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560
worry about us.

426
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,800
We've talked about it.

427
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,600
We are going to

428
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,920
open a breakfast shop.

429
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
We will work hard

430
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,760
and live a good life.

431
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,160
Great.

432
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,080
Don't worry about us.

433
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,680
Great.

434
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,800
Dongbao, good for you.

435
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,880
Good man. Sit down.

436
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,440
One more good news.

437
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,240
Welcome back,

438
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,960
Xiang,

439
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
and

440
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,400
Captain

441
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,680
Chen Hao.

442
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Welcome back.

443
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,120
Let's eat.

444
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,920
Can't wait.

445
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,680
Have some meat.

446
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,920
The Fourth Station has a tradition.

447
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
At every

448
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
festival,

449
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,680
everyone has to perform a show.

450
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,400
Look,

451
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
someone

452
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,680
is fully prepared.

453
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,560
Showtime!

454
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,320
The truth is

455
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,720
I didn't prepare it.

456
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,000
Every festival,

457
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,400
you take it out

458
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,320
and ask me to give a performance.

459
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,440
How festive today is!

460
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,240
Give him a round of applause.

461
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,200
Come on.

462
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
Alright, you win,

463
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,360
I'll give a performance.

464
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,520
But you will perform with me.

465
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,560
Let's perform together.

466
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,120
That's a "No".

467
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
Every festival,

468
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,680
you ask me to perform a show.

469
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,560
Director.

470
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,680
Stop it.

471
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,000
Director.

472
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,240
Every festival, you ask me to perform.

473
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,720
I hate performing

474
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,440
at festivals.

475
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,320
Come on.

476
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,160
I'll help you in the show.

477
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,520
Come on.

478
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,480
What's the performance?

479
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,760

482
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,160
Rap.

483
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,120

Keep it in mind.

582
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,040
Pack up

583
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,920
and go home.

584
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
No mission today?

585
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,240
Did you learn your French

586
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,520
in a French class?

587
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,120
I learned French when

588
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,400
I studied in France.

589
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,640
You've been to France?

590
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,280
My parents used to do business in Nanjing.

591
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,880
Later, my family decided to move to Paris.

592
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,480
I lived in France for five years

593
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,080
and then returned to Nanjing alone.

594
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,640
Then, I went from Nanjing to Moscow,

595
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
then Shanghai.

596
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,000
What about your family?

597
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,960
They stayed in France.

598
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,600
I have two elder brothers

599
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,760
and a younger brother.

600
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,280
What about you?

601
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,080
Did you grow up in Shanghai?

602
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,280
Me?

603
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,120
I grew up

604
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
by the sea in Fengxian.

605
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,320
My parents are fishermen.

606
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,160
We lived in a little fishing town

607
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,120
by the sea in Fengxian.

608
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,240
Later, I went to

609
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,680
the Zhejiang Police College.

610
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,600
Later, I came to Shanghai.

611
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,360
You've been fishing since you were a kid.

612
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,800
You're asking a fisherman

613
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
if he can catch fish.

614
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
I'll take you to the sea

615
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,640
to fish when possible.

616
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,320
I don't think it will ever happen.

617
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,200
Why are you laughing?

618
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,120
Nothing.

619
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,560
I thought we had nothing to talk about

620
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,120
except work.

621
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,920
It was good for us to have a chat.

622
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,320
How could the power go out?

623
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,400
Yeah.

624
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,200
There are frequent power outages here.

625
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,200
Pack up and go home.

626
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Please show your ID.

627
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,800
Mr. Feng,

628
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,200
I know you.

629
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,160
Last time,

630
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,720
I made it clear to you.

631
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,160
The shipyard is off-limits.

632
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,200
I have an important case.

633
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,720
Show him the search warrant.

634
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,040
I've

635
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,720
talked to someone

636
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,520
from the Security Dept.

637
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,080
Give them a call.

638
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,880
Who was on duty

639
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,200
on the 21st?

640
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,960
Both of us.

641
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,520
We're on duty this week.

642
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,400
On the 21st, a patient checked in.

643
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,080
His name is Hua Zhen.

644
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
He's from the S.M.C. Do you remember him?

645
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,880
Speaking of the S.M.C,

646
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,200
I remembered.

647
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,960
Was there

648
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,920
a girl

649
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,040
with him?

650
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,200
I thought

651
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,600
there was a girl.

652
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,200
Is that girl her?

653
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,520
Yes.

654
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,480
She was wearing a police cap.

655
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,720
So I looked at her a few times.

656
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,200
Mrs. Peng.

657
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,280
He's awake.

658
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,640
Ganwen,

659
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,760
here they are.

660
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,520
Hello, Mr. Peng.

661
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,840
Thank you for saving my life.

662
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,640
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

663
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,280
Lean back to save some effort.

664
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,120
Careful.

665
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,800
Give them the photos.

666
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,600
Ganwen asked me

667
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,920
to get these back.

668
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,840
It contains

669
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,280
the reason why he's been arrested

670
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,480
and the truth you wanted.

671
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,800
Two months ago,

672
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,040
Shen Bao asked me to write a story.

673
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,640
So, I went to

674
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,040
the Hongji Benevolent Society

675
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,600
to collect material.

676
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,640
That was why

677
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,760
I talked to refugees

678
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,640
every day.

679
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,160
I happened to find out

680
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,160
there were always ronins in that place.

681
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,720
So,

682
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,400
I contacted the NSO

683
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,000
and formally investigated

684
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,080
the Japanese boss.

685
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,080
This is a photo from the NSO.

686
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,360
Is the Japanese boss

687
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,920
you are talking about

688
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,480
Nakamura Naoki?

689
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,760
Yes.

690
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,080
I secretly

691
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,920
took this photo

692
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,200
in the restaurant.

693
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,560
Nakamura Naoki served in

694
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,800
Division No. 4

695
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,000
of Kwantung Army.

696
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,240
He was in charge of propaganda.

697
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,800
I gave this photo

698
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,960
to the NSO.

699
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
One day,

700
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,840
at the Shiliupu Wharf,

701
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,200
I saw Nakamura Naoki

702
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,560
get on a cargo ship

703
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,960
named Shinei Maru.

704
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,360
I got on the ship

705
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,440
among the porters.

706
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,160
The pictures

707
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,560
you have

708
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,760
were taken secretly by me on the ship.

709
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,400
I inquired

710
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,320
at the wharf.

711
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
The owner of the goods

712
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,320
was Nakamura Naoki.

713
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
The ship

714
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,880
was bound for Nagasaki port.

715
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,880
Are these photos of the cargo on board?

716
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,800
Yes.

717
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,880
This is bristles.

718
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,240
This is tungsten sand.

719
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,800
These are the ordnance

720
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,120
supplies to the army.

721
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,640
Do you know

722
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,320
what was in these buckets?

723
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
It was tung oil.

724
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,120
All of them are military supplies.

725
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,520
These things should be

726
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,080
in the warehouse of the Kuomintang army.

727
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,440
How did they end up

728
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,800
on a cargo ship bound for Japan?

729
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,680
The cargo boxes

730
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,000
were all covered with tea leaves.

731
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,760
These items were covered below.

732
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,560
I guess

733
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,680
they wanted to sell these goods to Japan

734
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,760
with the disguise of tea.

735
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,680
Are bristles and tung oil

736
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,880
also military supplies?

737
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,360
Yes.

738
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,320
Bristle brushes are used to

739
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,720
paint warships, airplanes,

740
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,920
and vehicles

741
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,840
and to clean

742
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,760
the barrels of machine guns and cannons.

743
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,160
About tung oil,

744
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
there is a common saying,

745
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,520
a tung tree

746
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,880
is equivalent to a machine gun,

747
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,840
a tung nut

748
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,040
is equivalent to a grenade,

749
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
and a tung seed

750
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,720
is equivalent to a bullet.

751
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,880
There is only one possibility

752
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,240
of selling these munitions to Japan,

753
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,240
and that is smuggling.

754
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,360
You're right.

755
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,040
I only took this photo

756
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,240
in the restaurant.

757
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,720
I thought

758
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,760
they were trading something.

759
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,880
Now, it looks like

760
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,840
they were trading

761
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,160
this ship of munitions.

762
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,880
Mr. Peng,

763
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
did you see the face of

764
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,640
the man with only his back in the photo?

765
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,160
No.

766
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,760
Mr. Peng,

767
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,480
I have a question.

768
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,600
The people who tried to take you

769
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,240
were trying to get

770
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,160
the pictures and the negatives,

771
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,880
right?

772
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,000
Yes.

773
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,000
The more they feared,

774
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,640
the more it showed

775
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,760
that this was matters a lot.

776
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,120
It's a pity

777
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,280
that the ship

778
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,680
should have arrived in Nagasaki.

779
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,880
I have no evidence

780
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,400
other than these photos

781
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,720
and speculation.

782
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,880
What do we do

783
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,240
next?

784
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,360
Mr. Peng needs time to recover.

785
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,840
I will keep investigating

786
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,800
until I find evidence of

787
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,360
their smuggling.

788
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,720
That's just his speculation.

789
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Maybe

790
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,400
the situation

791
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,840
is not what you think.

792
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,840
I've found the answer,

793
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,680
so do you, I think.

794
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,320
I just don't know

795
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,160
why I see

796
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,360
a glimmer of hope deep in my heart.
