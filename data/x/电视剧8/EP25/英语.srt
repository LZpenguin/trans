Shooting Stars EP25

3
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,720
Mr. Wei.

4
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,640
Welcome.

5
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,480
This way, please.

6
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,600
This is the Shanghai site

7
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,360
of the French Concession Intelligence Team.

8
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,240
From now on,

9
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
you're part of the intelligence team,

10
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,560
with your guise

11
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,440
being an employee at the AG Brewery.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,840
Right this way.

13
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Mr. Wei, this way.

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
This is the office Mr. Yu

15
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
has prepared

16
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,200
specially for you.

17
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,680
And this,

18
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,560
is a car for you.

19
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,960
If you have

20
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,840
any other requirements,

21
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,560
just let me know,

22
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
and I'll look after your needs.

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,320
I'll report

24
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,440
your findings to Mr. Yu.

25
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,920
All this...

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,560
for me, alone?

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,320
Exactly.

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Mr. Yu is the boss,

29
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
you, can I say,

30
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
are

31
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
my assistant assigned by him?

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,080
Absolutely.

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,800
Tell me,

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,440
who is Hua Zhen

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,320
currently in contact with?

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
A journalist named Peng Ganwen.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,640
Peng Ganwen,

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,200
from what I know,

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
has offended the police.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,920
Hua Zhen

41
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,560
rescued his wife

42
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
from the police

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,320
and afterwards, she disappeared,

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
likely

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,520
hidden by Hua Zhen for her protection.

46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,160
Where is Hua Zhen now?

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,960
At Jiangnan Shipyard.

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,600
He's here in Shanghai

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,560
officially

50
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,720
on a mission

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,280
of the S.M.C..

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,840
Tell me more about this Peng Ganwen.

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,720
He's a journalist for Shenbao Newspaper,

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,360
and also a member of the NSO.

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,080
As far as I know,

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,200
he's a pro-Communist.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,080
Hua Zhen's rescue of his wife

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,280
might have been

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,520
under communist directives.

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
How did he manage to cross the police?

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
He uncovered some

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,200
internal scandals within the Public Security Bureau

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
and planned to expose them.

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,240
Internal scandals of the Public Security Bureau.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,200
I see,

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
he's really stirred up trouble.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,720
Mr. Jin,

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
take a look at this.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,720
These are

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,960
all the materials I've collected

71
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,840
on the NSO.

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,760
There have been

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,440
active communists

74
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
in the so-called national salvation organization

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,720
for quite a while.

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,320
Back when I

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
was at the Shanghai Garrison Command,

10078
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,840
I didn't want to alert them,

10079
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,800
planning to let more fish flow in

10080
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
and allow the fish to multiply.

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Now,

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
Hua Zhen's involvement

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,080
has given us a chance.

84
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,200
He's saved NSO member,

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,280
and NSO has to respond.

86
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,680
Once the NSO responds,

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,080
our opportunity has come.

88
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Hua Zhen saved Mrs. Peng.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
If you save someone, you have to offer shelter.

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
Hotels and guesthouses

91
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,440
are entirely out of the question.

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,800
They're too risky.

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,440
That's why

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,240
I know of

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,680
a few houses here,

96
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
possible places they use

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
as shelters,

98
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
like

99
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Zhejiang-Ningbo Association,

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Merchant Shipping Hall,

101
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,840
and three stand-alone apartments

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,720
in the French Concession

103
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360
in which they've been

104
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
renting rooms for long.

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Shanghai is not big.

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,360
If we keep watching

107
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
and search one by one,

108
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
we'll find them eventually.

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
These people outside,

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,680
from the Special Service?

111
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,400
Can you mobilize them?

112
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
Everyone in the Special Service

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,640
is at your disposal.

114
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
How much to fill in?

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,080
Fill it up, thanks.

116
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,360
Got it.

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
Here you are.

118
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,680
Okay, thank you.

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,680
Excuse me,

120
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
I was wondering

121
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,800
if you know of any truck drivers around here.

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,560
Oh yes,

123
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,040
they often

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
come here to refuel.

125
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,840
Why?

126
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
I run an insurance company

127
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,200
and I'm interested

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,360
in finding out if these truck drivers

129
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,760
would be interested in insuring their trucks.

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,320
Asking them one by one

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,600
might annoy them,

132
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
so I thought I'd ask for your guidance first.

133
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,600
You've come to the right person.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,720
This is

135
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,360
the only gas station in this area,

136
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,480
and all the trucks

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,960
on this street come here.

138
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
I know of

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,080
only three companies that own trucks around here:

140
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,120
a post office,

141
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
a trading company,

142
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
and a

143
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,600
seafood seller right down the street.

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,400
They come here the most.

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,600
You might want to check over there.

146
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,600
Great, thanks.

147
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,800
You're welcome.

148
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
Hongyang, hurry up, let's go.

149
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,360
Come on.

150
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,120
Coming, I'm coming.

151
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,480
Let's go

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,880
Wenxiang,

153
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
hurry, let's go.

154
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,880
Let's go drink.

155
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960
Move it, quickly!

156
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,160
Mengling, time to go.

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
Goodbye.

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,120
Goodbye.

159
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,600
Did you get all the locations?

160
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,080
Got them.

161
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,840
Tonight I'll go there

162
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,680
with Xiang Yuansheng.

163
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,680
I hope your cooperation goes smoothly.

164
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
Don't forget your mission.

165
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,400
How could I?

166
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,400
By the way,

167
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,400
someone from the Fourth Station got hurt.

168
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,360
They wanted me to visit.

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,320
Forget it,

170
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
I won't go.

171
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,120
I wouldn't be of any help anyway.

172
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Goodbye.

173
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,840
What did I say?

174
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,720
I told you the Captain wouldn't be home,

175
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,880
and you didn't believe me.

176
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,560
He's not here.

177
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I just wonder

178
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
what's so busy with

179
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,320
working under Feng Guangyun

180
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,000
that he doesn't even have time to visit Dongbao.

181
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,920
Has anyone seen him recently?

182
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,120
Yuansheng,

183
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,120
you're rarely back.

184
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,880
The Captain should at least meet you.

185
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,760
Not yet.

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,040
Alright.

187
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,240
enough complaining.

188
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,160
Let's go.

189
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,080
The lad,

190
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
thirty years old,

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,440
stuck in the Fourth Station for years,

192
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,440
finally made it to the precinct.

193
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,360
He'd been through a lot.

194
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,600
I introduced him

195
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,440
many good jobs,

196
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
but he never took them.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Those jobs were well paid ones,

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,560
but he was set on being a cop.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,160
Besides,

200
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,000
he's now under Feng's roof.

201
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,800
He never got along

202
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,840
with Feng before.

203
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,760
Now he must impress Feng

204
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,000
with hardworking and good performance.

205
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,600
Am I right?

206
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
It's understandable...

207
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,400
Captain?

208
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,560
Captain?

209
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,360
Capt... Captain,

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,800
we just visited Dongbao.

211
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,200
We collected some money for him

212
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,160
to buy some good food

213
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,880
for his health.

214
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,200
He's optimistic.

215
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,280
Don't worry about him.

216
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,000
Good that you visited him.

217
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,520
I've told Erbai before,

218
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,320
I've been too busy

219
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,400
to visit him.

220
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
What about you?

221
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,520
Do you even treat us like crew members?

222
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Competing for Feng's mercy

223
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,800
against his lackeys every day,

224
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,280
and couldn't spare two more minutes

225
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,600
in Dongbao's wedding.

226
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,600
I just want to know,

227
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,000
is your Criminal Investigation Dept. really that busy,

228
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,840
or do you

229
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,120
just not want to see us?

230
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,080
That's enough!

231
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
This is my share.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
Let him buy something good.

233
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,200
Give it back to him!

234
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,600
Give it back!

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Dongbao doesn't need your money!

236
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,440
Let's go.

237
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,360
Hold on!

238
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,400
I'll make sure

239
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
Dongbao gets this money.

240
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,920
Don't let him off the hook!

241
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,760
There are three trunk owners

242
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,360
in this neighborhood.

243
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,800
First, the post office,

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
second, a trading company,

245
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,000
and third, a seafood company.

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
The first two got the wrong trunks.

247
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,760
So, it's just this

248
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,280
San Yang Fisheries.

249
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,840
We'll make our move

250
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,920
right after those two leave.

251
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,200
It's the right type.

252
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,560
Look at the wear trace

253
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,520
on this screw.

254
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,800
It seems like the license plate

255
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,840
has been frequently removed and reattached.

256
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
9521?

257
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,840
On the night

258
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,480
when you and Luo Minmin

259
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,760
took away Mrs. Peng,

260
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,200
I saw a truck

261
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
chase after you.

262
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,160
I knocked down some poles

263
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,960
to block its way.

264
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,920
When the poles fell,

265
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,600
they hit the front of the truck.

266
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,600
See these scratches.

267
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,440
Come on,

268
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,600
let's get inside.

269
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,720
How come

270
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,240
there's no one on duty?

271
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,200
It's 7:30 PM.

272
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,200
Maybe they

273
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,760
have less inventory?

274
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,320
Either their business is poor,

275
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,160
or

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,440
this place

277
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,680
is purely an assembly place for them.

278
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Let's go.

279
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,240
Damn the water pipe's broken again.

280
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,080
Never give me peace of mind.

281
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,400
When I was on the Meng murder case,

282
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,120
I suspected

283
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
that Feng Guangyun

284
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,320
hired a group of thugs on the outside

285
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,280
to handle dirty work for him

286
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,560
that the police couldn't openly

287
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,400
deal with.

288
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,520
Mr. Peng was also

289
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,760
taken by that truck.

290
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,520
No one saw it happen.

291
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,560
Now, it's just speculation.

292
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,040
Because the precinct's records

293
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,120
indicate that Mr. Peng was secretly arrested

294
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,080
by Feng Guangyun.

295
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,320
I've looked everywhere possible,

296
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,840
prisons, detention centers,

297
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,040
and couldn't find Mr. Peng.

298
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,480
I suspect

299
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,720
he's been secretly detained

300
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,800
by these thugs.

301
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
Mrs. Peng also mentioned that a truck

302
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,560
without license plates

303
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,240
was lurking around

304
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,560
near her house

305
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,720
a couple of days before Mr. Peng disappeared.

306
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,560
Without any other leads,

307
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,000
we have to start with this truck.

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,160
Fortunately, we now know

309
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
its license number.

310
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,320
Tomorrow I'll try my luck

311
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,160
in the precinct's archives.

312
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,240
I don't have many thick jackets.

313
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,880
Make do for now.

314
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,560
I'll find some more

315
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,520
for you later.

316
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,520
It's fine,

317
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
as long as I can wear it.

318
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,560
On a closer look,

319
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,400
it's alright.

320
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
Your clothes,

321
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,320
it's up to you.

322
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,400
Let's go,

323
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,480
my treat today.

324
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,560
I forgot,

325
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
last time at Dongbao's place,

326
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,560
I gave him all my money.

327
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,840
Typical.

328
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,160
When have you ever paid the bill

329
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,880
when we go out for noodles?

330
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,840
I didn't expect it.

331
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,560
Boss.

332
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Stop looking.

333
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
Yours is empty too.

334
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,520
Eat noodles without money?

335
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,640
Three bowls of Yangchun noodles.

336
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,400
Thanks, boss.

337
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,040
Coming right up.

338
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,320
I have money. It's on me.

339
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
Join me.

340
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,880
Captain,

341
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,360
I've given

342
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,520
the money to Yu.

343
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,720
She asked me to thank you.

344
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,040
Now I have a few questions.

345
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,960
Go ahead.

346
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:54,960
Have you guys

347
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,200
been working together all along?

348
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,440
You are investigating

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,480
Mr. Peng's case,

350
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,400
right?

351
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,200
I was there

352
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
for everything that happened

353
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,800
at the hospital,

354
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,560
and you still kept it from me.

355
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,360
We were indeed investigating

356
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,560
Mr. Peng's case.

357
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,080
Captain,

358
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,680
Mrs. Peng's case

359
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,800
was the last one

360
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,240
I took

361
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,320
at the Fourth Station.

362
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,120
You told me

363
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,360
to stop looking into it,

364
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,120
but since

365
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
I'm already involved,

366
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
let me in.

367
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,880
Minmin,

368
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,840
it's too...

369
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
I know what you're going to say.

370
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,040
Even though I'm no longer

371
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,960
a police officer,

372
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,840
I feel like

373
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,800
I haven't completed

374
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,320
my last case at the Fourth Station.

375
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
You're a police officer too,

376
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120
you must understand my feeling,

377
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,400
right?

378
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,480
I can stop asking

379
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,520
questions.

380
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,880
But if there's anything

381
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,400
I can help with,

382
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,240
please tell me.

383
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,160
I hope the month I spent

384
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,040
at the Fourth Station

385
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,640
can have a clear end.

386
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,960
Okay,

387
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,360
Captain?

388
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Understood.

389
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,400
Here are the noodles.

390
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,200
Take your time.

391
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Let's eat.

392
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,160
Thanks, boss.

393
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,360
Eat up,

394
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,480
and if it's not enough,

395
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,360
we can order more.

396
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,320
Wait,

397
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,160
it was you

398
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,320
who emptied the Captain's wallet, right?

399
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,800
You knew everything.

400
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,520
Why did you echo Erbai?

401
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,320
And you, Captain,

402
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,880
you care so much about the Fourth Station,

403
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,320
why argue with Erbai?

404
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,520
Couldn't you just humor him?

405
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,040
Can we eat now?

406
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,840
Go ahead.

407
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,320
Eat up.

408
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,320
Oh,

409
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,560
these noodles really need

410
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,320
vinegar to taste good.

411
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,320
Here, pour some on.

412
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
I don't like vinegar.

413
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,080
Just eat.

414
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,160
You're lucky to have food.

415
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Exactly.

416
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,080
Captain.

417
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,880
Thank you.

418
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
9521?

419
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,800
Feng Sir!

420
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,240
What are you doing here?

421
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,760
Feng Sir.

422
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,160
I'm asking you,

423
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,240
what are you doing here?

424
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,680
Checking records.

425
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,600
Who allowed you in?

426
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,600
You should be

427
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,760
patrolling the streets right now.

428
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,320
What are you doing checking records here?

429
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,000
Speak up!

430
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,160
It was Officer Wang.

431
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,240
He asked me to write

432
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,520
a summary report for this month's work.

433
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
Wang Yong!

434
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,520
Feng Sir.

435
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,480
Is that true?

436
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,720
Yes, it is.

437
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,160
I thought

438
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,920
his last meeting notes

439
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,720
were well done,

440
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,600
so I gave him some more tasks.

441
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,800
You arranged this?

442
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,520
Yes.

443
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,720
How come I wasn't informed?

444
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,280
You weren't here.

445
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,000
Get lost!

446
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,640
Yes Sir.

447
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,320
Chen Hao,

448
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,080
this isn't like your

449
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,920
Fourth Station archives

450
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,320
where you could come and go as you pleased.

451
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,000
Feng Sir,

452
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,080
I really didn't know

453
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,640
there were additional rules

454
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,920
for entering the archives.

455
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:53,960
Did I miss

456
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,880
some other procedure?

457
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,120
You're here to look up previous cases?

458
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,400
Which case?

459
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,920
The Miss Wang burglary case.

460
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,760
The Miss Wang burglary case?

461
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,320
Then why are you looking

462
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,760
in the vehicle records cabinet?

463
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,880
It's my first visit.

464
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,480
I wasn't clear on the layout.

465
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,680
Then you better

466
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,120
know your place.

467
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,600
Understood.

468
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,640
Listen up,

469
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,120
from today onwards,

470
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,800
if you want to access the archives,

471
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,920
you must apply through me.

472
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,160
I have to

473
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,320
approve it first.

474
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,400
Yes, Sir!

475
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880
Get out.

476
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,680
Hi.

477
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,360
As usual.

478
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay.

479
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,320
Take care.

480
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,760
Everything alright?

481
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,200
All good.

482
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Boss, boss.

483
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,480
With so many guards at the door,

484
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,120
Mr. Peng is probably detained inside.

485
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
We should leave.

486
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,720
Today, we went to

487
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,840
the address registered for the truck.

488
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,360
The building was heavily guarded,

489
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,880
so we speculate

490
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,720
that Mr. Peng

491
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,840
is likely held inside,

492
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,120
which is why we're considering taking a risk.

493
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,480
However, Xiang Yuansheng and I

494
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,040
need

495
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,400
another hand for our plan,

496
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,880
so I wanted to ask

497
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,440
if Luo Minmin

498
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,600
could join us.

499
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,280
The former female officer from the Fourth Station?

500
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,680
Yes, you remember?

501
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,760
Of course,

502
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,520
I have a deep impression.

503
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,880
She saved Li Qiushi.

504
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,440
When Mrs. Peng

505
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
first came to report at the Fourth Station,

506
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,360
she was the officer who took the call.

507
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,400
She's been involved from the start

508
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
and now she wants to see the investigation through

509
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,160
to the end.

510
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,920
What reason do I have

511
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,720
to refuse?

512
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,840
Great,

513
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,160
I'll inform her

514
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,880
right away.

515
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Stay safe.

516
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,960
Am I late?

517
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,320
Come over, we're planning right now.

518
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,800
Here's the route for tomorrow.

519
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,200
Minmin,

520
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,000
can you read the map now?

521
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,040
Yes.

522
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
When she first came to the Fourth Station

523
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
she couldn't even tell north from south.

524
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,720
Captain,

525
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,640
I've seriously memorized the Shanghai map

526
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
at the female police training class.

527
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,160
No matter where you drop me,

528
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,720
I can find my way back.

529
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,200
I'm the squad leader

530
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
at our training class.

531
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,000
Looks like you can handle things on your own now.

532
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,200
But tomorrow

533
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,480
will be your first field operation.

534
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
You must follow Xiang Yuansheng's lead,

535
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,160
understood?

536
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,520
Understood.

537
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,160
Don't worry,

538
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,120
I'll take good care of her.

539
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,240
Good.

540
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,000
Alright, let's assign the tasks.

541
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,920
Since they're looking for Mrs. Peng,

542
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,280
we'll lead them into our trap.

543
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,520
Captain Chen.

544
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,320
What are you up to?

545
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Captain Wang,

546
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,960
just keeping an eye on this rickshaw

547
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,240
while the driver's gone to the bathroom.

548
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,320
Getting tired

549
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,960
and slacking off, huh?

550
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,840
No.

551
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
Any instructions?

552
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,720
No instructions.

553
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,440
Get in!

554
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,520
Police work.

555
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,400
You stay here.

556
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,200
Stay alert. I'm going to inform Feng Sir.

557
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,800
He must be going to notify Feng Guangyun.

558
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,680
There are still people at the door.

559
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,400
Now, hurry and through the window.

560
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,200
Here.

561
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,800
I'm not cold.

562
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,480
These are navy sailor gloves.

563
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,400
For preventing blisters.

564
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,240
They'll probably

565
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,400
be after us soon.

566
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,640
You sure you won't come with me?

567
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,960
If Feng Guangyun comes

568
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,680
and doesn't see me here,

569
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
he'll get suspicious.

570
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,080
I need to buy Chen Hao

571
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,240
as much time as possible.

572
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,240
Be careful.

573
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,240
Watch your head.

574
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,440
Slowly.

575
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,600
Take it slow.

576
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,800
You saw her go in?

577
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,800
Yes, Sir.

578
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,520
Did you get a good look at the woman's face?

579
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,680
Clear as day.

580
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,320
She's wearing

581
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,360
the same clothes

582
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
as the journalist's wife.

583
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,040
It's definitely her.

584
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,600
Stay at the door, don't alarm her.

585
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,480
I'm on my way.

586
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,400
Bring your team

587
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,040
and head to No. 23 Wangyun Road immediately.

588
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
I'm pulling back the Criminal Investigation Dept. officers.

589
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,360
Take action when you arrive.

590
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,880
Hurry up and draw a card.

591
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,840
What are you dawdling for?

592
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,680
Play that one.

593
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,880
You,

594
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,200
come with me to the bathroom, quick.

595
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,280
You need company to use the bathroom?

596
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,920
Go by yourself!

597
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,040
You're just sitting there

598
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,400
not playing, come on!

599
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,200
Why do you

600
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,120
need me to come with you?

601
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,640
Oh, right,

602
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,000
take the key.

603
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,680
It's pinching me.

604
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,560
I can't believe you...

605
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,000
you...

606
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,880
you sure know how to take a shit.

607
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,440
You've made me want to take a dump, too.

608
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,240
Give me some paper!

609
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,440
No, no, no!

610
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,840
Leave me some!

611
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,800
Am I supposed to use my hands?

612
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,200
Use your hands then!

613
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,440
Who did it? It stinks!

614
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,600
Hey,

615
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,960
be careful not to drop the keys.

616
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,880
Hello?

617
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,440
Hello?

618
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,960
I asked you to accompany me

619
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,200
and now you're all worked up.

620
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,560
Sounds like you're straining.

621
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,080
Fine, I'm not waiting for you.

622
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,280
I'm heading back.

623
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,680
Play your card, come on!

624
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,480
Don't rush me.

625
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Hurry up!

626
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,880
Always so slow.

627
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,360
Nine bam!

628
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,920
Nine bam!

629
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,200
Think twice

630
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,800
Peng!

631
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,400
Peng Ganwen!

632
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,200
South wind!

633
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,560
Yes!

634
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,200
I won!

635
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,640
Really?

636
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,400
Stop dawdling, play!

637
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,520
This round is mine!

638
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
Come on, play your card!

639
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,640
You want it?

640
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,680
Take or drop?

641
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,920
Stop dawdling.

642
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
Shuffle up.

643
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,240
Let's go.

644
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,000
Satisfied?

645
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
That works. It's actually quite good.

646
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,160
A big hand, right?

647
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,120
Mr. Feng,

648
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,920
they've been inside the room

649
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,680
and haven't come out.

650
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
The same room as before?

651
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,120
Yes.

652
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Man guarding the door?

653
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,000
Yes.

654
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,360
Take him back to the station.

655
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,440
You don't need to handle this here anymore.

656
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,760
Okay.

657
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,080
That journalist's wife

658
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,200
is in that room,

659
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,240
and so is Xiang Yuansheng.

660
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,640
He might be armed,

661
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
so be careful.

662
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,640
Our target is that woman.

663
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,120
Understood!

664
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,760
You guys, go in!

665
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Mr. Feng.

666
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
The room down the corridor?

667
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,120
Yes.

668
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,200
Give me the money!

669
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,400
Get some water!

670
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,640
Water!

671
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,760
The door won't open!

672
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,320
Move aside! Water's coming!

673
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,920
Peng!

674
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,120
Where's the water?

675
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,120
Mr. Feng, no one inside.

676
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
They must have jumped out the window.

677
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,120
Of course!

678
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,840
You think I didn't know?

679
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Go find them!

680
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,840
Understood!

681
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,600
Let's go.

682
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,600
Wait a second.

683
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,720
What is it, Mr. Feng?

684
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,240
How many men are guarding the journalist?

685
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,160
Seven.

686
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,400
Call and check on them now!

687
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,240
Yes!

688
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,640
Stop!

689
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
Don't run!

690
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,400
Quick!

691
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,000
Halt!

692
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,880
Stop right there! Stop!

693
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,960
Come back here!
