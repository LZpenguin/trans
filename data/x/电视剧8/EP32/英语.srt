00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,120
Ms. Shi!

4
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,240
We're old friends.

5
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,320
We just met

6
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
not long ago at the tailor shop.

7
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Mr. Wei, is there

8
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
something you need from me?

9
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,920
I'm truly sorry

10
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
for disturbing you so late,

11
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,360
but there is a matter

12
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,320
that requires your cooperation

13
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,800
for an investigation.

14
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
It's quite late today.

15
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,920
Perhaps another time.

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,160
I apologize, Ms. Shi,

17
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,680
but you know who I am

18
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,960
and why I'm here.

19
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,080
Mr. Wei, it's very inconvenient for you

20
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,840
to come uninvited.

21
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not here to socialize,

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Ms. Shi.

23
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,000
No point in pretending.

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,160
As a member of the French Concession's

25
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,760
Council Police,

26
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,080
you

27
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,600
must be aware of

28
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,760
what A.G. Beer does?

29
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,360
If there's something you need,

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
you can find me

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,840
at the Council tomorrow.

32
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,880
Sorry,

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,000
it's not strictly official business.

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,760
Tsvetaeva?

35
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
Ms. Shi, you and I

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,280
go way back.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
I've

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
made acquaintance with you

39
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
since the Meng family murder case,

40
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,560
a peculiar connection indeed.

41
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,760
Connect me

42
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,640
to the Central Patrol.

43
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,640
Apologies.

44
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,840
Ms. Shi,

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,320
Mrs. Ji from Zijin Tailor Shop

46
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,840
has been arrested,

47
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,280
and that puts you in a difficult position, doesn't it?

48
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
Just because I had clothes

49
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,080
made there,

50
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm a suspect?

51
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,760
This dress, did Mrs. Ji make it as well?

52
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Come,

53
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
take me downstairs.

54
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
Let's take a look at your car.

55
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
What's wrong with my car?

56
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's check it out

57
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,920
and see.

58
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,880
I know all too well

59
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
what you did

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
when arresting Communists.

61
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
Don't put on a show with me.

62
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,880
Ms. Shi,

63
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,080
when it comes to combating Communism,

64
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,800
your Council

65
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,240
and our Reviving Society

66
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,320
stand side by side.

67
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,440
So you wouldn't recline

68
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,480
a cooperation request, right?

69
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,280
Go downstairs

70
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
and show me your car.

71
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,280
Here's my car.

72
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,920
Want me to open

73
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,800
the doors for you?

74
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,920
No need.

75
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
Apologies for the trouble.

76
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
We were

77
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,920
pursuing a Communist,

78
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,280
who was rescued by his accomplice

79
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,760
driving a car just like this.

80
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,560
You know,

81
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,840
you're the only one I know

82
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,120
who happen to drive

83
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,640
the same model

84
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,720
and you just happen

85
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
to know Mrs. Ji,

86
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,280
whom we arrested.

87
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,680
It's my duty

88
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
to verify this.

89
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,760
I hope

90
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,640
when you report back,

91
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,920
you'll let the others at the Secret Service know

92
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
to stop bothering me.

93
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Don't be upset, Ms. Shi.

94
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
Maybe I can make it up to you

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,160
by inviting you out for a beer sometime?

96
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,400
I've always loved stargazing.

97
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,400
In my early days at Shanghai,

98
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
I used to

99
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,560
lie by the window and gaze at the stars.

100
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
During my sea training,

101
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,120
I spent long periods lying on the deck, gazing into sky.

102
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
Can you see more stars

103
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
at sea?

104
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,400
Yes,

105
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,880
like shooting stars.

106
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,920
Do you know

107
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,560
which one is the brightest?

108
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
Sirius,

109
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,600
that one there.

110
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,240
It's the brightest star in the night sky.

111
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
You can find it

112
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,400
by following the belt of Orion.

113
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Lying on the deck,

114
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,080
I watched it rise from the southeast

115
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
a few hours after midnight,

116
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
reaching the south by dawn.

117
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,600
Especially in

118
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,080
the winter months at dawn,

119
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,280
it shines

120
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,400
brilliantly white.

121
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
In ancient Egypt,

122
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
people used Sirius

123
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
to predict the flooding of the Nile;

124
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,280
in ancient Greece,

125
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,120
it marked

126
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,240
the dog days of summer;

127
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,840
and in the Southern Hemisphere,

128
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,000
Polynesians

129
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,560
used it to mark the winter.

130
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
I've heard

131
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
that when people sail across the ocean

132
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
for days and nights,

133
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,560
seeing only water

134
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
with no landmarks

135
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,080
to tell them where they are

136
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
or where they are going,

137
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
sailors observe

138
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
the stars

139
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
because the stars

140
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
can show them the way.

141
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
That's still true today.

142
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,960
Enemies can jam

143
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
mechanical detectors

144
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,800
and disrupt compasses and chronometers,

145
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,320
but they can't destroy the stars.

146
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Look,

147
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,480
some stars dim

148
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,080
and others brighten.

149
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,640
Instead of the brightest star,

150
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,480
I prefer watching

151
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,440
many stars shining.

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,760
Drive them away!

179
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,120
[Feng, show yourself!]

180
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,640
[Smuggling tung oil to the Japanese,]

181
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,440
[are you trying to be]

182
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
[a lapdog for the Japanese?]

183
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,680
[Quiet!]

184
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
[We demand answers!]

185
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
[Everyone, calm down!]

186
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,560
Feng Sir,

187
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,000
this is bad!

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,640
The place is swarming

189
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,520
with reporters looking for you!

190
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,560
For me?

191
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes.

192
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,560
What do they want with me?

193
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,320
They want an interview.

194
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,880
That Peng

195
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,000
yesterday at the Guotai Theatre

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,280
spilled everything about you

197
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,000
and Deputy Director Tan,

198
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
especially about you!

199
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,920
He claimed

200
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,400
the kidnapping was under your orders

201
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,520
and that the smuggling is also connected to you.

202
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,480
Nonsense!

203
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,120
What does that

204
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
have to do with me?

205
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
I don't know either!

206
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,720
But now everyone's

207
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
asking about it!

208
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,200
Drive them away!

209
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,880
All of them!

210
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,400
Well...

211
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,400
I...

212
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,480
What are you waiting for?

213
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,080
Drive them away!

214
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
Yes, Sir!

215
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,320
[Disperse!]

216
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,080
[Everyone disperse!]

217
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,280
[Break it up!]

218
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,320
[Go away!]

219
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,000
Sorry, Feng Sir.

220
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,280
What happened

221
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,960
at the Guotai Theatre yesterday?

222
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
We thought it was just

223
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,520
a fan meeting with a playwright,

224
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
nothing significant,

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
but unexpectedly,

226
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,720
that journalist Peng

227
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
suddenly appeared

228
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,600
and started making bold statements.

229
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,960
He also brought a dozen

230
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,240
of his journalist colleagues,

231
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
and I just found out

232
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
that the playwright

233
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,680
is actually a leftist.

234
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,200
So, I suspect

235
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
that the CPC

236
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,160
might be

237
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,680
plotting something behind the scenes.

238
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,080
Right now, I'm only concerned

239
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,600
about the port clearance permits.

240
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Two shipments

241
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,720
are due at Shiliupu Wharf tomorrow.

242
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,880
With this incident,

243
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,800
are the permits still releasable?

244
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,520
Rest assured,

245
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,400
Mr. Gao of the Shanghai Customs District Anti-smuggling Section

246
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,320
has promised me

247
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,880
the permits

248
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,560
will be issued on time.

249
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,760
Deputy Director Tan,

250
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,320
for me,

251
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,280
this isn't just about

252
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,520
whether a shipment

253
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,760
can get to Nagasaki Port.

254
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,880
It's about whether this supply chain

255
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,680
can continue

256
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,120
to operate.

257
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,320
This matter affects

258
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
the strategic plans of the Army Ministry

259
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,640
and, consequently, your...

260
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,920
career prospects.

261
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,640
I understand.

262
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,000
I will

263
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,760
personally oversee this

264
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,560
and ensure your shipment

265
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
boards on schedule.

266
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,240
Mr. Hua? There's a call for you.

267
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,520
Hello?

268
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,120
Feng Sir!

269
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,800
Mr. Feng, you really can't go in!

270
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,600
I need to see the Deputy Director urgently.

271
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
Deputy Director Tan specifically instructed...

272
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,840
Feng Sir!

273
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,440
Deputy Director,

274
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,480
have you heard

275
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
about Peng's statement?

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
He's now coming out

277
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,240
accusing me of kidnapping, murder,

278
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,440
and smuggling involvement.

279
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,840
I was just helping you

280
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,080
pick up and deliver things.

281
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,560
How could that be smuggling?

282
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,600
You're well aware of all I've done.

283
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,000
Why the panic?

284
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,600
The precinct entrance

285
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,200
is swarming

286
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,560
with journalists demanding answers from me.

287
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,600
What should I do?

288
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,560
What do you want to do?

289
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,840
Arrest the journalists,

290
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,440
keep an eye on the NSO people.

291
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,760
We need to shut them up.

292
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,080
What do you think

293
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
we should do?

294
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Right now,

295
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,600
you don't need to do anything.

296
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,480
Just go home and lie low.

297
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,880
I don't quite follow.

298
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,840
That means

299
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,760
you're being suspended.

300
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,440
Suspended?

301
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,840
Yes,

302
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,960
We'll tell them that you're under investigation.

303
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,480
Now that things have escalated to this point,

304
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
let them come at me

305
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,120
whatever they got.

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,280
But even if I'm suspended,

307
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,760
the permits and manifests are still out there.

308
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Will they really let me go?

309
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
I've already suspended

310
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,840
my best men for investigation.

311
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,200
What more do they want?

312
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,240
Don't worry,

313
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,000
the suspension is just for a few days,

314
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,480
mainly

315
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
to appease the public.

316
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,800
I've already discussed it

317
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,400
with Mr. Nakamura.

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,280
Once this blows over,

319
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,960
business will continue as usual,

320
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,440
and you

321
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
will be back

322
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,000
at my side soon enough.

323
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,280
Leave it to me.

324
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,760
Tomorrow the shipment arrives

325
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,040
at Wusong Port.

326
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,840
It's our last chance

327
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,920
to intercept the Shinei Maru.

328
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,200
This could

329
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,360
sever the smuggling route

330
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
once and for all.

331
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,640
They usually hand over

332
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,600
the permits and manifests

333
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,080
to Feng Guangyun.

334
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,520
Early tomorrow,

335
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
I'll follow Feng Guangyun

336
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,000
and see if I can

337
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,520
retrieve those documents.

338
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,640
I'm going with you.

339
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,720
Why?

340
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,600
I can do it myself.

341
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,480
That's an order.

342
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,160
Orders?

343
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,480
Are you still my Captain?

344
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,480
Am I still your crew?

345
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,840
I'm not your captain,

346
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,040
but your comrade

347
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,760
from now on.

348
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,680
What?

349
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,680
Your application for

350
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,960
joining the Party has been approved.

351
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,240
Has his application

352
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,720
been approved?

353
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,280
Yes.

354
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,040
He's been one

355
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,960
of our members.

356
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,080
And you're

357
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,040
a CPC member

358
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,640
from now on.

359
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,840
Really?

360
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,160
Yes.

361
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm arranged

362
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,280
as your superior.

363
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
My code name is 307.

364
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
And we'll contact

365
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,200
each other directly in the future.

366
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,040
[Sir,]

367
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,160
[do you]

368
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,120
[join the Party]

369
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,080
['cause you believe]

370
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,440
[it's a necessary path]

371
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,520
[to achieve the ideals?]

372
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,840
[Regardless of life or death,]

373
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,320
[dedicate all to the country.]

374
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,560
[I wanna become]

375
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,640
[a man like Deng Mingyuan.]

376
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,040
[We will]

377
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,400
[do.]

378
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,720
[May you]

379
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,880
[understand my choice one day.]

380
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,720
The day finally comes.

381
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,920
Minmin.

382
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
Go back home after dinner.

383
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
Pardon?

384
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,920
You should

385
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,320
go home after having dinner.

386
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,960
No.

387
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,040
I must work

388
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,000
with you tomorrow.

389
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,040
Feng Guangyun

390
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,280
has long wanna hurt you.

391
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,200
What if

392
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
he doesn't cooperate

393
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,600
and kills you

394
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,120
directly?

395
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,560
That's why we asked you to go home.

396
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,040
This is your task.

397
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,440
Is my task to go home?

398
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
Don't you wanna be a person

399
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,560
like Ms. Shi and Mrs. Ji?

400
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Then you should learn to obey the order.

401
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,760
But

402
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,480
I just want to

403
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,120
do something

404
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,360
to help you.

405
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,400
Not run away

406
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,360
in times of crisis.

407
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,720
I understand.

408
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,840
But we three can't

409
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,120
take actions at the same time.

410
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,080
When there is war,

411
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,480
people are sent to the front

412
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,480
and rear lines.

413
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,440
This is the tactic.

414
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,880
If any emergencies,

415
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,920
you can help us

416
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,800
at any time.

417
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
Do you understand?

418
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,440
Moreover,

419
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,040
since in Sanyang Fisheries

420
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,880
you haven't got back home for several days.

421
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,720
Your family must

422
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
worry about you.

423
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,480
How can you perform

424
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,320
the next tasks

425
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,480
before handling your own business?

426
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,280
Chen Hao's right.

427
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,080
I'll send you back after dinner.

428
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,360
But you're...

429
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,120
No worries.

430
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,960
I've almost

431
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,680
recovered.

432
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,960
And,

433
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,800
Yuansheng is by my side.

434
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,400
Go back home

435
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,160
to make your family feel at ease.

436
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,040
We'll meet you

437
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
when we finish the task.

438
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,080
OK.

439
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,200
I'll do it,

440
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,080
and prepare tasty food,

441
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,680
including what you like most,

442
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,160
waiting for your back.

443
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,680
Captain,

444
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,120
is it called

445
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,360
a victory meeting?

446
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,040
Yes.

447
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,880
A victory meeting.

448
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,120
Have a dinner.

449
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,560
[Dad.]

450
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,680
[Dinner is ready.]

451
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm coming.

452
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,840
What food do you cook?

453
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,920
Courgette.

454
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,880
It's good.

455
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,040
Help me.

456
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,680
Dad.

457
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,920
Minmin

458
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,880
disappeared for three days.

459
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,160
We can't find her anywhere.

460
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,920
Why don't you worry?

461
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
It's not salty.

462
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,880
Dad,

463
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
you're right to stop her

464
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,440
after she's seriously injured last time.

465
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,360
[The Fourth Station was disbanded,]

466
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,280
[she stays]

467
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,480
[with Chen Hao all day.]

468
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,160
[He's wanted through the city.]

469
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't you worry about her?

470
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,480
Have your dinner.

471
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,640
Enjoy yourself.

472
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,360
It tastes good.

473
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,680
Well, dad,

474
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,400
I need

475
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,000
some fresh air outside.

476
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,920
Go back

477
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,640
soon.

478
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,640
Minmin.

479
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,040
Dad.

480
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,880
Minmin is back!

481
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,320
Minmin.

482
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,280
Are you injured?

483
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,280
What happened?

484
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,520
Why

485
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,120
so long?

486
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,240
You okay?

487
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,160
Any injuries?

488
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,560
No.

489
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,920
I'm fine.

490
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,280
I plan to

491
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,680
dismantle your bed,

492
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,000
if you don't come back.

493
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,680
Where did you go?

494
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
I can't have the meal.

495
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
Tell us.

496
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,960
We don't know nothing.

497
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,680
Dad is waiting for you every day.

498
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,160
Dad, Minmin is back!

499
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,440
Dad, here!

500
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,360
Come in.

501
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,120
Hurry up.

502
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,800
Come in.

503
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,200
Good.

504
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,960
Dad,

505
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,080
don't be angry.

506
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,240
I've been back safely.

507
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,280
I went on a trip

508
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,200
with Captain Chen

509
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,080
and

510
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,040
Xiang Yuansheng.

511
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,160
We went to the suburbs.

512
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
And they took a good care of me.

513
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,600
We...

514
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,800
Sorry, dad.

515
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,480
I made you feel worried again.

516
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,160
Minmin.

517
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,200
I can guess

518
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,280
how you spent

519
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
these days.

520
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,200
I was furious

521
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,320
that you're seriously injured.

522
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,240
But I'm more afraid that

523
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,200
you can't wake up anymore.

524
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,560
You should understand

525
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,560
that

526
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,360
the three

527
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,760
of you

528
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
mean everything

529
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,440
to me.

530
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,000
Did you remember what you'd said

531
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,120
when you got injured last time?

532
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,760
Yes.

533
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,240
I said that

534
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,560
I would remember your words.

535
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,920
You told me that

536
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,560
if

537
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,200
I couldn't protect myself,

538
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,160
then I couldn't protect others.

539
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,560
Can you protect yourself now?

540
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,920
Dad.

541
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
I'm not sure

542
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,000
whether

543
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,520
I have the confidence

544
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,920
to protect myself

545
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
or

546
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,160
anyone

547
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
else.

548
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,080
But I've learned a lot

549
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,000
these days,

550
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,920
which has made me

551
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,480
realize that there are many things

552
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,800
that I have to do.

553
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,520
I thought

554
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,360
if I worked hard to

555
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,240
protect my family,

556
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,360
I'd have a better life.

557
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,640
But later,

558
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,800
I find a better life

559
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,080
can't bring me

560
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,200
real happiness.

561
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,880
We can't only live a happy life ourselves.

562
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,280
Dad.

563
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,880
I've felt

564
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,240
the spirit of dedication

565
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,520
from people

566
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,920
like Captain Chen,

567
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,080
Xiang Yuansheng

568
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,320
and

569
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,320
other new friends.

570
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,480
They're

571
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,360
taking me to do

572
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,240
something meaningful

573
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,480
every day.

574
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,240
I

575
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,200
can feel

576
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,680
that they can sacrifice

577
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,480
everything for their ideals.

578
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,200
It has made me

579
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,880
feel empowered

580
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,560
and fulfilled every day.

581
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,080
Dad,

582
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
the Captain

583
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,440
told me

584
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,880
that is

585
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,880
the power of belief.

586
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,240
I should

587
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,480
learn from them

588
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,440
to use faith

589
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,240
as support

590
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,440
and devote myself

591
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,200
to the ideals.

592
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,640
Let me

593
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,920
carry you up.

594
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,360
C'mon.

595
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,760
Take care, dad.

596
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm heavy.

597
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,200
Actually,

598
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,080
you've been grown up.

599
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,800
[We're coming.]

600
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,560
Have a sit.

601
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,240
I'm not that old.

602
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,640
Right.

603
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,440
Press it.

604
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,960
Wait.

605
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,080
Change the light.

606
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,560
OK.

607
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,480
Press it, right?

608
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,800
Yes.

609
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,520
Close it.

610
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,400
OK.

611
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,360
Hurry up.

612
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,120
OK.

613
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm ready.

614
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,640
Fine.

615
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
Ready?

616
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,960
Make sure everyone is in the picture.

617
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,520
OK, smile.

618
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,400
Ready.

619
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,800
Three,

620
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,600
two, one, go!

621
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,160
[One more time.]

622
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,440
[Three,]

623
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,200
[two, one, go!]

624
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,680
[Where should we send]

625
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,920
[the evidence to tomorrow?]

626
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,120
Back here.

627
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,240
Someone will

628
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,360
contact the newspaper office

629
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,160
where printing will be done

630
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
at 1 p.m. every day.

631
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,480
The organization wanna make it aired

632
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
on the evening paper.

633
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,360
So, we must

634
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,880
get it earlier.

635
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,960
and send it back.

636
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,920
OK.

637
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,520
No matter

638
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,680
what happens tomorrow,

639
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,320
take the evidence back.

640
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,760
We'll meet here.

641
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,760
Both of us and the

642
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,680
two certificates

643
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,440
must be back here safely.

644
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,520
Feng Sir.

645
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,520
It's

646
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,400
the notice

647
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,280
of suspension.

648
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
You need to sign.

649
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm sorry for that.

650
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,040
Wang Yong,

651
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,640
it's temporary,

652
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,160
used to silence the reporters.

653
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,440
Indeed.

654
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,280
I'll be back soon.

655
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,640
Yes.

656
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,680
Don't be nervous.

657
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,000
And

658
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,920
tell others

659
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,840
to be careful.

660
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,160
Don't make remarks.

661
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,480
You understand?

662
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I got you.

663
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
All of us

664
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,640
will wait for you.

665
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,520
Can you go check if my police ID

666
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,880
is in the car?

667
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,320
OK.

668
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,760
Stop watching.

669
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,240
Don't stay here.

670
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,720
[Why isn't Mr. Feng waiting here]

671
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,120
[for picking up like before?]

672
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,040
It's not your business.

673
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,080
Put it here.

674
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,920
Mr. Feng,

675
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,480
why are you here?

676
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,440
Give me the pass.

677
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,160
I called you Mr. Feng

678
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,200
because of the relationship.

679
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,600
Well.

680
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,360
Why not wear the uniform?

681
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Since you're no longer an officer,

682
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,520
I cannot

683
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,200
give you such an important thing.

684
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,320
You said that I was your dog.

685
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
C'mon,

686
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,080
you're the real dog!
