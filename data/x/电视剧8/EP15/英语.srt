Shooting Stars EP15

3
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Xiang Yuansheng!

4
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,440
Are you okay?

5
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
I'm fine.

6
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,800
I'll call the others.

7
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,440
Be careful,

8
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Captain! Are you in there?

9
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,600
Who locked the door?

10
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,920
Step aside.

11
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm not an ordinary foreigner.

12
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,960
You have no right to arrest me.

13
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,400
A soldier?

14
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
Yes,

15
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,080
I am a soldier of the Empire of Japan.

16
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,080
Japanese Special Marine Corps in Shanghai?

17
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,800
Sure enough.

18
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,000
When our people arrive,

19
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,560
we'll bring him

20
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440
back to the Fourth Station.

21
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,160
What are you doing?

22
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,880
We can't handle this case.

23
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,160
I'll take you to Shiliupu.

24
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
What?

25
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
Shiliupu?

26
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,080
Yes. I should do this.

27
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,160
Tell me!

28
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,120
Will you bring him to Feng Guangyun?

29
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm suspended,

30
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,080
not dismissed.

31
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,400
I still have a chance to be a cop.

32
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Chen Hao,

33
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,640
do you know what you're doing?

34
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
Erbai will open it for you.

35
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,520
Go!

36
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,280
Chen Hao!

37
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,080
Do you work for Feng?

38
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
You know what I mean.

39
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,000
This is not

40
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
the way to Shiliupu.

41
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Why?

42
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,600
For Luo Minmin,

43
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,840
I've not gotten even with you.

44
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
Shut the fuck up!

45
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,400
Go!

46
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,080
Captain Chen, nice to meet you again.

47
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,840
What do you want?

48
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,400
He is suspected

49
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
of a criminal case

50
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
in the French Concession.

51
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
This is the arrest warrant.

52
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,880
I study

53
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
in the Japanese Youth

54
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,640
Industrial School.

55
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
I've never been to there.

56
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,560
On the 26th last month,

57
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
you stabbed

58
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,040
a middle-aged man with a dagger

59
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,560
at an apartment on Wangyun Road.

60
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,320
There are no more than

61
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,840
100 daggers of this type in total,

62
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,320
and each batch is different.

63
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,880
It's easy to trace the source.

64
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,040
In February this year,

65
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,840
a British inspector

66
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
was killed on

67
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,640
Folkson Road.

68
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
After this,

69
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,040
the dagger that he had with him

70
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,200
disappeared.

71
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,400
By coincidence,

72
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,840
it's the one lost.

73
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,560
We have reason

74
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,640
to believe that

75
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,840
you're the murderer.

76
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
Captain Chen,

77
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
can you hand him over to us now?

78
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm the one who caught him.

79
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,840
You're in the French Concession,

80
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,200
you must follow the rules.

81
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:07,960
Let's go.

82
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
What happened?

83
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,000
Where's Captain Chen?

84
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,560
Where's the Japanese?

85
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,320
Chen Hao took him away.

86
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
Who handcuffed you here?

87
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,000
We're also locked

88
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,960
in the corridor just now.

89
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,480
I don't know which jerk did this.

90
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
Who handcuffed you here?

91
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,400
Chen Hao has already handed the man over.

92
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,880
What?

93
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,880
To whom?

94
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
It's all over.

95
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,640
Let's go.

96
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Takagi Tamaki has been

97
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,520
imprisoned in the Central Police Station.

98
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
That day, you said

99
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,120
it's almost impossible to give him a sentence.

100
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,760
Is it still working even with

101
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,800
the ironclad evidence?

102
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
There is no

103
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,360
Japanese concession

104
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
legally in Shanghai.

105
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,680
But there are

106
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,760
Japanese military power

107
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,880
in Hongkou,

108
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,400
full-time directors

109
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
in the Council,

110
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,640
and

111
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,000
patrol policemen and officers

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
at various levels

113
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,400
in the police station.

114
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,160
In recent years,

115
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,040
Japan has greatly

116
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,160
increased their penetration.

117
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,800
The Japanese against the law

118
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,240
will only be

119
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,400
handed over to the consulate.

120
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,280
No one

121
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
has the right to interpose at all.

122
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,480
But then,

123
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,800
athletes will be dealt with

124
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,000
by their own referees.

125
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,640
That's right.

126
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,160
Fines are the most.

127
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,600
But some will be

128
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,440
extradited back

129
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,760
because of

130
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,680
the charges of councils.

131
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,160
If arrested

132
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,960
by the police of the

133
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,880
National Government,

134
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,560
a quiet release

135
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,280
would be done by Tan Shiyuan

136
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,080
through black case work.

137
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm eager

138
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
to see an immediate execution

139
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
by shooting.

140
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
But I know it's impossible.

141
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Extradition back to Japan

142
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
is at least

143
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
equivalent to being driven out of Shanghai.

144
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,280
Xiang Yuansheng

145
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,800
actually paid the most for this.

146
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,800
But it's not

147
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,360
the time to tell him the truth.

148
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,680
If he knew that

149
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,800
Tan Shiyuan was involved,

150
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,120
he'd take advantages of his identity

151
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
to investigate Tan.

152
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
This will bring too many new twists

153
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,680
against us to save people.

154
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,160
His identity?

155
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,760
Right.

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,720
Chen Hao,

157
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,240
you may

158
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,400
not know this.

159
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,240
I know it.

160
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,880
Our leader

161
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
was arrested at the home

162
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,040
of the Undersecretary Hua.

163
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,480
Although he didn't say anything,

164
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,680
I can guess that

165
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,360
he is

166
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,000
the son of Mr. Hua.

167
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,400
Ms. Shi,

168
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,520
I've been troubled by a question.

169
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,680
Is he

170
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,880
our comrade but just

171
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,960
not connected

172
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
to us yet?

173
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,040
Just like I did before.

174
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,800
When he came to the Fourth Station,

175
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
his certificate was given

176
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
to the leader by me in person.

177
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,880
I was thinking of this at that time.

178
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,440
But apart from

179
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,720
what's mentioned,

180
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
he's also a student

181
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
of the elite class

182
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,560
of the naval school

183
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,040
in direct line with Chiang Kai-shek.

184
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,120
After graduation,

185
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,000
he may be the backbone of the New Navy

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
of the National Government.

187
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,280
He used to

188
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,000
live in Yihe Road,

189
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,360
and studied

190
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,040
in an army school for 2 years.

191
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,360
His track of development

192
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,000
is different from most people.

193
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,120
My answer

194
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,160
to your question

195
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,760
is that it's impossible,

196
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
even

197
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,680
in the future.

198
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,880
I always thought

199
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,360
that he's

200
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
just wasting a month

201
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,200
investigating

202
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,400
the murder case in Shanghai.

203
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Surprisingly,

204
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
he traded his future for it.

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,160
Although he is on the

206
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,640
different road from us,

207
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,560
our goal

208
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,240
is the same.

209
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
To better protect the organization,

210
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,640
we could neither tell him

211
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,160
nor get him involved in.

212
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,880
I understand.

213
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,240
Out of protection

214
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,480
for the organization

215
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,880
and him,

216
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,480
I won't

217
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,000
reveal anything about Tan Shiyuan,

218
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,520
but keep him as far away as possible.

219
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,800
However...

220
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,240
I've already

221
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,800
considered him as my best friend.

222
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Why don't you go in?

223
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,880
I planned to hand him over to Shiliupu.

224
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,880
But he's taken away

225
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,640
by the Council

226
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,040
in the French Concession.

227
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,320
Then...

228
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,880
Why not to the Fourth Station?

229
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,040
You are afraid that he'll

230
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,800
be taken away from you?

231
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,600
Yes.

232
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
I've told you.

233
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,480
I don't want to be dismissed.

234
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
I wanna continue being a policeman.

235
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
So, you're clear that

236
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,120
Feng Guangyun will protect the killer.

237
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,120
I don't believe

238
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
you still planned to

239
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,640
hand over the man to him.

240
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,840
Do you really think

241
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,120
I'll never compromise?

242
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Even if he's not trustworthy,

243
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,760
there are many

244
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,120
higher-ups

245
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,680
in Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

246
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,800
If you don't trust

247
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,160
the police system

248
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
of the National Government,

249
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,080
why do you

250
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,880
insist on being a policeman?

251
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Those two Japanese

252
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,280
will be charged with murder.

253
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,400
The best result

254
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
is to extradite them back.

255
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
Is it the best?

256
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Yes, it is.

257
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
I tried my best.

258
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,400
After such a long investigation,

259
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,880
we only have one final step left!

260
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,840
One more!

261
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Why didn't you

262
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,640
compromise earlier

263
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,640
but wait until now?

264
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,720
Do you want all our efforts

265
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,600
to be in vain?

266
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm easy to act on impulse.

267
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,160
But I'm not stupid!

268
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,880
I know what I'm supposed to do!

269
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Have you ever thought of Li Qiushi?

270
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
She's only 8.

271
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,440
She saw her parents killed

272
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,120
being killed with her own eyes.

273
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,880
More than this.

274
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,920
To catch the murderer,

275
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,840
Luo Minmin was almost

276
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,000
beaten to death.

277
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,160
Have you ever thought of them?

278
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,680
And

279
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,680
the dead pawnshop worker

280
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,520
and the parlor owner.

281
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,160
The result should not be like this.

282
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,200
We've been working for a long time.

283
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
I thought you'd discuss with me beforehand.

284
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,480
You're a cop just for fun.

285
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,800
It's not what you wanna do most.

286
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
If you're tired in Shanghai,

287
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,680
you can go back to Nanjing.

288
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,160
But I'm not like you.

289
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,400
It's related to my future.

290
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
I can't make fun of it!

291
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,720
I don't need to discuss with anyone.

292
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,360
Never mention this

293
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,680
again from now on!

294
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
I hope you have reasons

295
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
that you cannot express,

296
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,840
and I won't ask too much about them.

297
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
But you're just talking nonsense.

298
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,400
I don't believe a single word.

299
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,800
Qiu Shi can't wait

300
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,640
to see you.

301
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,120
I've already bought her

302
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,680
a ticket to Hong Kong.

303
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,920
There are trusted friends

304
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,400
of her parents.

305
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,680
All well arranged.

306
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,800
When to leave?

307
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,840
2 days later.

308
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,920
Those two Japanese

309
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,480
haven been confirmed

310
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,880
as members of

311
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,400
Japanese Special Marine Corps in Shanghai.

312
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,600
Qiushi's parents

313
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
are important taxpayers.

314
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
They're murdered.

315
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
It made the Council furious.

316
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,080
The Council's interests

317
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,680
were also damaged after all.

318
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
Besides,

319
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
other businessmen with properties

320
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,480
in the French Concession

321
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,520
also asked the Council

322
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,240
to protect taxpayers.

323
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,200
So the Council

324
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,320
formally demanded that

325
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,600
the Japanese consulate

326
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
severely punish the killer

327
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,240
and

328
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,160
not interfere with the taxpayers' assets.

329
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
I know you fought for it

330
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,960
from the Council.

331
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,440
Thank you very much.

332
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,160
I should be the one to say thanks.

333
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,760
Mr. And Mrs. Meng

334
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,840
are my good friends.

335
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,160
I appreciate

336
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,600
what you've done for them.

337
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
The killer wouldn't have been

338
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,800
caught so fast without you.

339
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,760
Is sentencing

340
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,680
impossible?

341
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,880
In past cases,

342
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,200
extradition is the best possible result.

343
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,800
Only a piece of paper?

344
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,600
Dedicate everything

345
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,880
to the country construction.

346
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,200
What does

347
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,080
that mean?

348
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,800
If something

349
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,040
is good for the country,

350
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,080
do it even if

351
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,880
it costs your life.

352
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,640
You know Mr. He of the

353
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,200
Ministry of Military Affairs?

354
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,320
His driver

355
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,400
is my old friend.

356
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,040
Thanks to him,

357
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,800
ladies from official families

358
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,280
often come to my shop.

359
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,080
Amazing.

360
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
You'd have many

361
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,160
of the Ministry visiting here, innit?

362
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,880
Honestly,

363
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,800
in the decades since opening the store,

364
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,080
I've been

365
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,440
gonna Shanghai twice a month.

366
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,800
I can get

367
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,880
everything new there into my store

368
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,640
within half a month.

369
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,160
So

370
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,680
the rich people in Nanjing

371
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,120
often come to my shop.

372
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,600
To be honest,

373
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
I come here

374
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
to find a belt

375
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,480
just like

376
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,680
this one.

377
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,800
Look.

378
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,560
There's "Shunchang",

379
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,160
the same name

380
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,640
as your store.

381
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,800
Isn't this

382
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,960
what you made?

383
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,800
If I

384
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,400
recall correctly,

385
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,800
this belt was made

386
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,880
for Mrs. Hua

387
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
for her second son.

388
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,880
Mrs. Hua?

389
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,480
You mean the wife

390
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,720
of the Undersecretary Hua?

391
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,120
Yes.

392
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,680
But,

393
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,480
how...

394
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
did you get it?

395
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,600
By chance!

396
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,560
What a coincidence!

397
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,200
Measure me, please.

398
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,520
Captain Wei.

399
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,040
Sorry to keep you.

400
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,240
Never mind.

401
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,640
What did the Secretary-General say?

402
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,400
Did he allow me to arrest Hua Zhen?

403
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,160
He asked

404
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,600
do you have any other evidence?

405
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,840
No.

406
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,080
But this belt is

407
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,680
a direct proof that Hua Zhen

408
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
has a connection with the Communist Party.

409
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,240
Our team

410
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,200
have reason to arrest him.

411
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
Please tell the Secretary that

412
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,320
it's only been a short time

413
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,000
since I arrested Zhang Runjin.

414
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,040
Hua Zhen may not

415
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,960
even know that

416
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,160
I've obtained such evidence.

417
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,120
It's the best time to arrest him!

418
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,200
Have you found

419
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,080
any other relationships

420
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,320
between them

421
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,840
besides

422
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,080
Deng Mingyuan being his teacher?

423
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,680
Not yet.

424
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,080
Deng

425
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,160
is no longer useful.

426
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,240
As long as

427
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm allowed me to arrest Hua Zhen,

428
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,400
I can get

429
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,640
anything I want from him.

430
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,640
Captain Wei,

431
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,600
Deng

432
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,400
will be escorted to Nanjing tomorrow.

433
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,960
He can only stay

434
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,400
in your area

435
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,640
for one last day.

436
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,880
If you can not

437
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,560
seize the opportunity

438
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,800
to find more,

439
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,560
I'm afraid the Secretary

440
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,600
will not grant your request.

441
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,400
The belt...

442
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Isn't

443
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,880
it enough?

444
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,360
The Secretary

445
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,840
has always called for solid evidence.

446
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,520
By the way,

447
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,760
don't come here

448
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,800
next time.

449
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
After all, we're in the capital,

450
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,680
and it's easy for people

451
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
to think we're interfering

452
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,600
with the investigation.

453
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,880
You're right.

454
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm sorry.

455
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,440
I didn't think it through.

456
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,560
You might leave now.

457
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,400
Captain.

458
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,760
Where's Hua Zhen now?

459
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,160
In Jinmen Hotel.

460
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,400
How about Deng Mingyuan?

461
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,120
All handover procedures

462
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,640
have been completed.

463
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,960
The departure is 1 hour later.

464
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,880
You hurry back

465
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,920
and update the chief

466
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,200
on our progress in Nanjing.

467
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,880
Make sure

468
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,080
to buy me another hour.

469
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,520
Got it!

470
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,120
I have to interrogate Deng again.

471
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,160
Sorry, Sir.

472
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,960
The guest had made it clear that

473
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
he wouldn't see anyone.

474
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
I have an emergency.

475
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,440
As a rule,

476
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,200
we can't tell you

477
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,240
his room number.

478
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,840
I'm Wei Daiqing

479
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,840
from Shanghai Garrison Command.

480
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,800
May I see your

481
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,880
identification, please?

482
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,160
Thanks.

483
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,920
Sit down please,

484
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,200
Mr. Hua.

485
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,920
I don't seem to

486
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,880
have seen you before.

487
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,040
What can I do for you?

488
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,040
This is not

489
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,920
the first time we've met.

490
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
I met you

491
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,800
at your father's

492
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,960
birthday party

493
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,680
in Nanjing.

494
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
But I was on a mission then.

495
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,720
And I arrested Deng Mingyuan.

496
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,200
He's now

497
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,280
prisoned in

498
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,960
the Shanghai Garrison Command.

499
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
I know that

500
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,600
you've always

501
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,120
looked up to him

502
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,040
because he's your teacher.

503
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,880
We're in opposition with him,

504
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,480
but after all,

505
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,320
one can not be too ruthless.

506
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,680
I can understand

507
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,480
how much you respect him.

508
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,120
If

509
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,520
you wanna

510
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,200
see him for the last time,

511
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,400
I can arrange it.

512
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,320
And

513
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,120
if you wanna avoid suspicion,

514
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,240
then just pretend I haven't come.

515
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,480
The last time?

516
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,240
What does that mean?

517
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,160
1 hour later,

518
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,680
Deng will be taken to Nanjing.

519
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,400
And once he arrives,

520
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,720
he'll be shot.

521
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,800
Mr. Deng.

522
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,680
Hua Zhen.

523
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,080
Mr. Deng,

524
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,320
I have nothing more to ask you.

525
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,440
Out of my kindness,

526
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,400
I've made

527
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,240
a special request

528
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,200
to the chief

529
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,840
for your student

530
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,200
to see you here.

531
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,840
You can write down anything

532
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,520
you want to say.

533
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
By the rules,

534
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,720
the condemned person is allowed

535
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,400
for a family meeting before execution.

536
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But as far as I know,

537
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,680
you don't have

538
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,120
any relatives in Nanjing.

539
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,320
And no one would

540
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,720
go to the prison for you.

541
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,120
So whether you two

542
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,360
are on good terms or not,

543
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,760
he's the only one

544
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,040
to bid you

545
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,440
farewell.

546
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,320
Write down anything

547
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,680
you want to say.

548
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,360
Or you'll never

549
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,760
have a chance later.

550
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,200
Thank you.

551
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,280
Last time in Nanjing,

552
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,880
you said you're ready

553
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,000
for navy training.

554
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,840
At that time,

555
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,280
I was thinking

556
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,080
I should take you aboard myself.

557
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,600
I'm sorry

558
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
to meet you here

559
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,280
in this way.

560
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,360
They say

561
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,720
you've joined the Communist Party.

562
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,680
Is that true?

563
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,800
You've fought with the former PM

564
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,880
for many times.

565
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,840
You're a warrior and hero.

566
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,800
I really don't

567
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,880
understand your choice.

568
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,760
Everyone has an ideal,

569
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,160
which will

570
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,840
affect judgements

571
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,520
and the direction of progress.

572
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
That's how

573
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,080
I was influenced.

574
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,720
What's your ideal?

575
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,080
When you're 12,

576
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,360
You boarded the

577
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,920
Ship Yongfeng with me,

578
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,000
telling me to

579
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,720
defend our country no matter what.

580
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,000
Actually,

581
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
it's also my dream when I was in the navy.

582
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,200
Until today,

583
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm still committed to

584
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,880
dedicating everything

585
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,840
to the peace and security of the country.

586
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,440
In your opinion,

587
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,520
it can't be separated

588
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,680
from the Communist Party.

589
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,760
So you become

590
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,080
a member of them.

591
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,240
5 years ago,

592
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,120
the northeastern area fell.

593
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,920
And now,

594
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,160
the north China is in a precarious situation.

595
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,120
People may say

596
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,680
we compromise to avoid wars.

597
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,000
But what is war?

598
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,080
It often

599
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,000
breaks out

600
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,320
when you're powerless.

601
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,480
We lost Taiwan

602
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,120
in the First Sino-Japanese War.

603
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,200
There's no one but knows

604
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,440
that people who can fight can stop war.

605
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,840
Compromise can never

606
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,360
finally solve problems,

607
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,120
but only aggravate contradictions.

608
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,680
At present,

609
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,720
our country is in danger.

610
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,800
Regardless of party or origin,

611
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,720
we should all fight together.

612
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,280
The Chinese nation

613
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
has a history of over 5,000 years.

614
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,080
How could it

615
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,320
be defeated by a tiny country?

616
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,840
Mr. Deng,

617
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,040
I've asked you

618
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,240
in Nanjing...

619
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,160
Resisting aggression is not politics.

620
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,000
The northeast China has fallen.

621
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,280
The north China is endangered.

622
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,080
We will finally be at war

623
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,280
with those Japanese invaders.

624
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,080
If we have to fight one day,

625
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
will you return to the battlefield?

626
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,760
Sure.

627
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,680
I will.

628
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,240
Now I understand

629
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,800
that you never stop fighting.
