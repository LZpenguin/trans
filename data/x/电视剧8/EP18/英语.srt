00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,160
Shooting Stars EP18

3
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
I merely believe that

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,720
a person must excel in one thing

5
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,200
in his life.

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,640
He must know

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,040
what he wants.

8
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,800
And he can't become

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,080
a good-for-nothing.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
What about you?

11
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,760
Why did you join the Navy?

12
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,240
When I was transferred

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,520
from the Army University to the S.M.C.,

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,320
many people told me

15
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,960
it was a shortcut for promotion.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,520
But it isn't.

17
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,120
Our country's navy force

18
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
is weak.

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,160
But why do you want to be part of it?

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
To date,

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,360
the main force of our naval fleet

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,080
are antique warships

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
inherited from the Qing Dynasty.

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,520
They are outdated,

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,000
low-speed and firepower-weak.

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
But the world maritime powers

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,800
have been

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
through revolutionary evolution.

29
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Obsession with big warships and cannons

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
has been abandoned.

31
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
A new mode of carrier-based aircraft

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,360
striking the enemy's fleets

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
is more and more dominating battlefields.

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
These countries have many battleships,

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,280
cruisers, destroyers

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,920
and even aircraft carriers

37
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,080
equipped with advanced propelling system

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,720
and weapons.

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,440
Including Japan.

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,960
It has been 40 years

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
since the First Sino-Japanese War.

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,880
and our country's navy made no progress.

43
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,760
Japan had developed into

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,320
a maritime power.

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
The tonnage of its warships

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
is well over 1.15 million tons.

47
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,120
Ours is

48
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,320
poorly 60,000 tons.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,760
That is like

50
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,320
an ant fighting with an elephant.

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,880
The strength disparity is appalling.

52
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,160
That is why

53
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,880
I decided to do my part in the Navy.

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
Your attitude is completely different from

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
that

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,520
when you were in the Fourth Station.

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,720
Because this is my ideal.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
I used to think

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,400
many simple

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,840
and joyful things

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,240
could make a person

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,280
feel satisfied.

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,920
For instance,

64
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,120
I wear a pair of shoes I like today.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,960
I feel lucky it is not a rainy day.

66
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
As I come back home,

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,080
dinner I like

68
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,120
is ready.

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
I have watermelon with my family

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
in the courtyard in summer.

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
I pick up osmanthus flowers

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,560
on the ground in fall.

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,680
Now I realize

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
a person should have

75
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,280
something to dream of.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Maybe

77
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,840
this is the so-called ideal

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
you defined.

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
Come on, brother.

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,240
Coming.

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,280
I get it.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,120
Let's go.

83
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,920
Brother, did you notice

84
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,520
while

85
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,280
they were talking,

86
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
their eyes were twinkling.

87
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,600
Luo Minmin

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,640
is a careless girl.

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,240
But she got serious just now.

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,520
You are right.

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,400
Yuansheng is not only handsome

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,520
and family-prominent,

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,160
but also knowledgeable and kind.

94
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,840
To be his girlfriend

95
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,360
is a very happy thing.

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,680
Minmin is an above-average girl.

97
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,280
Of course.

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,840
But they two

99
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,160
are far different.

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
Officer Xiang is like a tree.

101
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
Minmin is like a flower.

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,480
That's why

103
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,080
they can find

104
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,840
each other's unique good qualities.

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Yuansheng appreciates

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,040
Minmin's lively personality.

107
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,200
Minmin admires

108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,760
Yuansheng

109
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,040
as an aspirational man.

110
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,120
Though different,

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,920
they complement each other.

112
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,840
Agreed.

113
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,040
OK, we need to hurry up.

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
The rain has eased.

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,400
I have to go.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When will your train depart?

117
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,360
At one o'clock tomorrow noon.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
The captain and I will see you off

119
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,360
tomorrow.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
Please don't.

121
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
Someone will take me to the train station.

122
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,800
Let's bid farewell now.

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,320
Xiang Yuansheng,

124
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,440
why did you come here?

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Did you come here for the police manual?

126
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
But,

127
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,040
during the time you worked here,

128
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,960
you never

129
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
read it.

130
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
I was thinking,

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,600
maybe

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
we won't meet each other anymore.

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
But fortunately,

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,520
I had spoken out what I wanted to say.

135
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,480
I saw

136
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,800
the one I want to see.

137
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,040
The one you want to see?

138
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,120
Mr. Hua.

139
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
I was looking for you in Jinmen Hotel.

140
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,680
But you weren't there.

141
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
I guess

142
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,920
you are here.

143
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,360
You are under arrest.

145
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,920
You are on suspicion of communist membership.

146
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,800
This is the warrant issued

147
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,680
by the Shanghai Garrison Command.

148
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Do you have proof?

149
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Of course, I have.

150
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
I will show you

151
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,040
one by one.

152
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,520
We can begin with Xiang Yuansheng,

153
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,440
your alias.

154
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Captain,

155
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,680
should we take the girl as well?

156
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Yes.

157
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,640
I will interrogate them

158
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,320
tomorrow morning.

159
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,280
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,400
Take them away.

161
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,520
Don't touch me.

162
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,320
Don't move.

163
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,800
Let me go.

164
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,320
Heading back.

165
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Captain Wei,

166
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,480
is Luo Minmin

167
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
a communist suspect?

168
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,320
We suspect

169
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
she is your accomplice.

170
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,920
So tell me.

171
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
Why didn't she go home at night?

172
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
Did she have a meeting

173
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,880
with you?

174
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
I thought you knew our relationship.

175
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
Miss Luo is my girlfriend.

176
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
We didn't plan

177
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
to make the relationship public.

178
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,440
At least not now.

179
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,560
Now that you came across us,

180
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,320
we don't need to conceal that anymore.

181
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,400
I met my girlfriend

182
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,200
one last time

183
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,080
before I left the city.

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,560
It is reasonable, right?

185
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,400
You...

186
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,280
and her?

187
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,280
We have a lot of time

188
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
to solve the problem between us.

189
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,960
If you don't have enough proof

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,800
to say

191
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,480
Miss Luo is a communist,

192
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,160
you should let her go home.

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Sorry.

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,440
We tracking team

195
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,080
got procedures to go through.

196
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,320
If she is innocent,

197
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,920
she will be released.

198
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,160
Hello.

199
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,960
Secretary Guo,

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,120
it's Wei Daiqing.

201
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,080
Hua Zhen has been arrested.

202
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,840
He is taken into custody

203
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,800
in a cell of the Garrison Command.

204
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
What should we do next, secretary?

205
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,840
His family will get the information soon.

206
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,080
They will take him back

207
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
to Nanjing.

208
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,120
You go as planned.

209
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,000
The rest

210
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,600
is not your concern.

211
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, sir.

212
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,360
Captain.

213
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
We have brought

214
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,160
Hua Zhen's all belongings

215
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,240
from his hotel.

216
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
Nothing special.

217
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,960
Miss Luo.

218
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Luo Minmin.

219
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,280
Your father

220
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
is running a photo studio.

221
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,760
Your mother died

222
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,520
when you were eight years old.

223
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,360
Your brother

224
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,400
Luo Tianxiang was conscripted in 1932.

225
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,800
After he deserted and came back,

226
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,280
he didn't have regular employment.

227
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,360
He was often blackmailed by scumbags.

228
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,960
And then

229
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,920
he did odds and ends in a mahjong parlor.

230
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,600
But not long,

231
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,280
the owner of the mahjong parlor was dead.

232
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,040
He lost his job once again.

233
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,360
Your younger sister Luo Qinqin

234
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
is in senior year of high school.

235
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
According to my calculation, Miss Luo,

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
minus living expenses,

237
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,880
the rest of your family's income merely

238
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,240
affords your younger sister's tuition fee.

239
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,880
And you, Luo Minmin.

240
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,400
You performed bad in school time, and

241
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,600
failed three police admission exams.

242
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,560
This year, you were recruited and ranked

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,080
at the bottom of the admission list.

244
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,200
You are not smart.

245
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,760
You don't excel in anything.

246
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,000
You are neither pretty

247
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,800
nor talented.

248
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,200
What do you want to say?

249
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,000
I want to say that

250
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,800
you know

251
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,960
Hua Zhen's family background well.

252
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,800
But it doesn't mean his prominent identity

253
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,680
can make him immune to investigation.

254
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,920
The Establishment won't prosper forever.

255
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,480
But, given his family background,

256
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,840
do you think he would

257
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,760
fall on an ordinary girl?

258
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,920
Does he really like you

259
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,080
or just use you

260
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,880
and the relationship

261
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,080
to cover something?

262
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,560
The answer is obvious.

263
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,680
God

264
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,440
doesn't always like

265
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,120
a smart and pretty girl.

266
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,000
Sometimes he likes a dumb girl

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
as well.

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,440
So does Xiang Yuansheng.

269
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I'm certain

270
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,560
he likes me.

271
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,200
I know him very well.

272
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,560
He is not who you think.

273
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,800
He wouldn't attain any goal

274
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
by doing naive behavior.

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,800
We just

276
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,760
like each other

277
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,200
simply.

278
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,000
It looks to me that

279
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,560
you've never

280
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,840
experienced anything like it.

281
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
You have no idea

282
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,280
how stupid you are!

283
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,160
Dad,

284
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,240
I have it prepared

285
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,440
to deal with the problem of Hua Zhen.

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,440
M.M.A. agreed if Shanghai allows it,

287
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,800
he would be transferred to the Ministry

288
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,240
of Military Affairs for interrogation.

289
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,360
We still have time.

290
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm going to set off to Shanghai.

291
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,840
I know what you are worried about.

292
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
I have got everything in order.

293
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,720
Don't worry about it.

294
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,680
He is in 20s

295
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,560
and still acts childish.

296
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,520
He should be cultivated more.

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,480
He was out of line this time.

298
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,920
But he will never help out any communists.

299
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm certain of that.

300
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,080
You must cope with it carefully.

301
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
He must learn a lesson

302
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,280
this time.

303
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Mr. Hua,

304
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,320
your tutor

305
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,440
stayed in this cell before.

306
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,000
Do you enjoy it?

307
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
This is your statement of confession.

308
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,960
If you press your fingerprint

309
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,160
on it

310
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,520
before the court hearing,

311
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,840
I'll intercede on your behalf.

312
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
Don't waste your time.

313
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,760
Nobody will help you

314
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,520
plead not guilty.

315
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,480
Did we investigate

316
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,520
Miss Luo's family?

317
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,200
Not yet.

318
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,680
So,

319
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
we should get them all here for interrogation.

320
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,480
Why is Luo Minmin still in custody?

321
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,440
'Cause I have authority

322
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,520
to keep her here.

323
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,920
I just talked with Miss Luo.

324
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,200
The little girl

325
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,040
is unbelievably naive.

326
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,920
She thought

327
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,600
you really crushed on her.

328
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,560
I told her the good and the bad

329
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,960
of the current situation.

330
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,480
I hope she will acknowledge the fault

331
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,080
she made.

332
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,640
I intend to keep her

333
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,840
in her cell for a long time,

334
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,920
When I call her,

335
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,280
she has to come.

336
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,320
'Cause I need to interrogate her

337
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,520
whenever I want to.

338
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,520
Mr. Hua,

339
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,440
I know

340
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,280
you never suffered setbacks.

341
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,480
As a man,

342
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,720
you will use up your good luck

343
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,320
one day.

344
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,160
I mean it.

345
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,600
Think about

346
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,280
what the real world is.

347
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,600
Director An,

348
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
It will be a long time

349
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,240
before we meet again.

350
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,960
Stay in touch.

351
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,000
OK.

352
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,920
What's more,

353
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,640
if you need

354
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,280
any assistance

355
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,560
in Shanghai,

356
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,600
just call us.

357
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,640
We will help you.

358
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,280
Come to me

359
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
as you go to Suzhou.

360
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,760
We will.

361
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,760
OK, I need to go.

362
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,280
OK.

363
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,200
Goodbye, Director An.

364
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,040
Take care, Director An.

365
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,040
Staff Chief Tong.

366
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,640
Are you leaving?

367
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,480
Yes, Sir.

368
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,840
I came to say farewell to others.

369
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,960
Then I'm going to pick up Hua Zhen.

370
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,560
You don't

371
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,080
need to do that.

372
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Captain Wei arrested him

373
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,400
in this morning.

374
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,480
You did?

375
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,600
Yes, sir.

376
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,080
What for?

377
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,120
We believe

378
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,560
he is a member of the Communist Party.

379
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,360
Do you have proof?

380
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,560
Suspicion or certainty?

381
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,120
It's almost certain.

382
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,800
He is Deng Mingyuan's accomplice.

383
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,640
Of course,

384
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,080
if you want

385
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,040
to see him

386
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,280
before leaving,

387
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,640
I can arrange the visit.

388
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I told Hua Zhen that

389
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,360
If he has any association

390
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,440
with Deng Mingyuan,

391
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,000
our friendship

392
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,280
will end.

393
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,560
This is my attitude.

394
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,000
I know

395
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,600
you got along with him

396
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,320
in the Army University.

397
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,760
But now

398
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,120
you can't do anything for him.

399
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,880
His brother is

400
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,320
on the way to Shanghai.

401
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,080
You don't have to delay yourself here.

402
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,160
Captain Wei,

403
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,360
you've been working so hard on him.

404
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,680
Finally, you got what you want.

405
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,800
Congratulations.

406
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,240
It is my duty

407
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,920
to stay loyal to our country.

408
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,120
It has been almost nine hours

409
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,720
since they were taken away

410
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,600
last night.

411
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
Why are they still put in custody?

412
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,800
Yes, brother.

413
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,560
My sis and Xiang

414
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,680
are in real trouble, are they?

415
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,440
His elder brother

416
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,960
is the secretary of the Office of Aides, isn't it?

417
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,840
She is losing her mind

418
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,120
and talking foolishly.

419
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm not.

420
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,960
Yesterday,

421
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,800
I heard Xiang said so with my own ears.

422
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
He said his brother was

423
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,280
the Secretary of the Office of Aides,

424
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,800
and his dad was the Undersecretary of

425
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,120
the Ministry of Military Affairs.

426
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
Are you crazy?

427
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
If she's not crazy,

428
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,680
Xiang Yuansheng is crazy.

429
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,880
They don't believe me.

430
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,280
I don't want it.

431
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,640
What she said is true.

432
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,560
Although Xiang Yuansheng didn't tell it,

433
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,240
it is a fact.

434
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,600
Brat,

435
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,000
Are you crazy too?

436
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,560
You're all crazy.

437
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,320
Secretary Hua,

438
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,440
it must be a tiring journey from Nanjing.

439
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,680
Are you Captain Wei?

440
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,520
Yes, sir.

441
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,720
I'm Wei Daiqing, the leader of

442
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,280
the investigation team.

443
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,040
Staff Chief Tong told me

444
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,560
you'd be attending the trial.

445
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,680
He ordered me to stay at your service.

446
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
I know very well

447
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,800
about Hua Zhen.

448
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,280
I can report it to you in detail.

449
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,520
It can wait.

450
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,520
Come in.

451
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Uncle Tong.

452
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,560
Hua Liang.

453
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,120
The long journey must have worn you out.

454
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,520
Glad you are here.

455
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,920
Before my departure,

456
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,680
my dad kept reminding me

457
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,040
to apologize to you

458
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
as soon as I arrived in Shanghai.

459
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm sorry

460
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,480
to trouble you.

461
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,560
Don't be a stranger.

462
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,960
Have a seat.

463
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,440
OK.

464
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,480
I can understand Undersecretary Hua.

465
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,840
I told your father on the phone

466
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
about the situation.

467
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
This time,

468
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,120
Hua Zhen made a mistake of principle.

469
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
My dad won't interfere

470
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,680
with any procedures.

471
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,280
I think we can send

472
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,520
Hua Zhen to Nanjing to be interrogated

473
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,440
by the Ministry of Military Affairs.

474
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,800
I think it's doable.

475
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,600
Mr. He is in charge of

476
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,360
Shanghai Garrison Command.

477
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,400
Hua Zhen is a relative of an officer

478
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,600
of the Ministry of Military Affairs.

479
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,280
Mr. He has known him well since he was little.

480
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,960
We can manage to solve it internally.

481
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,800
The situation

482
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
is much more complicated than it was

483
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,680
when I spoke

484
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,800
to your father.

485
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,520
Hua Zhen was classified

486
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,880
as a Category III political prisoner.

487
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,960
His trial will not

488
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,720
be carried out alone

489
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,640
by the Military judiciary of

490
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,960
the Shanghai Garrison Command.

491
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,200
Are you saying

492
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,320
that he will undergo a joint trial?

493
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,360
Yes.

494
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,920
An interim joint trial Military Justice

495
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,560
commission has been set up.

496
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,040
In addition to the Command,

497
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,560
people from the Shanghai government,

498
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,800
the Shanghai party department,

499
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,480
and the second branch of

500
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,120
the Jiangsu High Court will join the trial.

501
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,760
I'm afraid that

502
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,320
Hua Zhen couldn't go back to Nanjing.

503
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,280
How could it be so serious?

504
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,400
What evidence does

505
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
Wei Daiqing have?

506
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,160
About this,

507
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,040
I can not disclose.

508
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,200
The key to this case

509
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,560
does not lie in evidence

510
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,960
but the timing.

511
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,360
Mr. He sentenced

512
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Deng Mingyuan to death

513
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,440
himself.

514
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,480
Immediately after his case was closed,

515
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Wei Daiqing claimed

516
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,120
Hua Zhen and Deng Mingyuan colluded.

517
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,960
What can you expect

518
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,600
from Mr. He?

519
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Hua Liang,

520
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,800
I am an old friend of your father.

521
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,600
I have a question for you.

522
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
Did Hua Zhen

523
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,440
join the CPC?

524
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,040
He has a great future awaiting.

525
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
He will never join any CPCs.

526
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,560
Brother.

527
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,960
I'm sorry, Secretary Hua.

528
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,200
I shouldn't have stayed here

529
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,520
to get in your way.

530
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,680
But I have to stay

531
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,560
according to the rules of the Command.

532
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,000
Someone has your back.

533
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,520
You don't take orders from me.

534
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,240
Do whatever

535
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,440
you want.

536
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,840
Could you open the door for me?

537
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Had fun in Shanghai?

538
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,600
And ended up in prison.

539
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,880
And they said

540
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,360
you were a communist.

541
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,120
Brother,

542
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,120
you know where I stand.

543
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,120
Everything I did in Shanghai

544
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,040
has nothing to do

545
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,520
with politics.

546
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,360
I know

547
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,800
where you stand.

548
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,800
But it's no use talking about it now.

549
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,560
I was planning to take you back to Nanjing,

550
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,160
having you interrogated there,

551
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,120
and solve the case internally.

552
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,120
But it won't work.

553
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,440
Then I'll stand

554
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,520
the interrogation here.

555
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,120
OK.

556
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,320
Good for you.

557
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,120
I am here to tell you that since

558
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,120
you're not a communist, don't admit it.

559
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,560
Don't lose your footing.

560
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,800
Dad misses you.

561
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,440
Things will work out.

562
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,000
I got it.

563
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,640
Do you need to change,

564
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,760
take a shower,

565
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,680
and have some palatable food?

566
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,840
I have a request.

567
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,240
I have a friend

568
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,800
who is innocent and has been implicated.

569
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,320
She's detained here too.

570
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,360
Could you take her out?

571
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,200
I can't.

572
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,520
I didn't travel a long way

573
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,320
to rescue

574
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,040
your friends.

575
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
Now, I'm convinced you're fine.

576
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,960
You're thinking about someone else.

577
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,120
She's not just a friend.

578
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,840
I like her.

579
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,480
Are you serious?

580
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,520
Yes.

581
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,240
She's a policewoman.

582
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,360
Her name is Luo Minmin.

583
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,120
Secretary Hua,

584
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,520
this is Miss Luo.

585
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,600
What else

586
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
can I do for you?

587
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,800
See you at the trial.

588
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,240
Please excuse me.

589
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,480
Feel free to come to me

590
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,800
if you need anything.

591
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,800
Thank you.

592
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,720
Are you

593
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,520
Officer Luo Minmin?

594
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,760
Yes, I am.

595
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,360
What's going on with Xiang Yuansheng?

596
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,920
They won't let him go, huh?

597
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,960
Did you mean Hua Zhen?

598
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes, Hua Zhen.

599
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,920
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

600
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,400
I'll send you back to the police station.

601
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,240
Thank you. I'll go back myself.

602
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,360
Hua Zhen asked me

603
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,240
to escort you back.

604
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,000
And I want to see what the place is like,

605
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,240
which holds my brother

606
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
from

607
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,800
going back to Nanjing.

608
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,000
Please.

609
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Thank you.

610
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,440
Excuse me.

611
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,800
Here it is.

612
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,680
Minmin, are you all right?

613
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,080
Why are you two here?

614
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,600
This way.

615
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
Director,

616
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,520
this is Xiang Yuansheng's brother,

617
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,240
Secretary Hua.

618
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,480
He came

619
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
from Nanjing.

620
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,840
Nice to meet you, Secretary Hua.

621
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm Zuo Ronghua, the police director.

622
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,000
Welcome you.

623
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,080
It's a great honor.

624
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,360
Hello, Director.

625
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,640
Welcome.

626
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,200
Please come in.

627
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,760
Get a glass of water.

628
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,080
Don't bother.

629
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,200
I'll leave in a minute.

630
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,800
This is where Xiang...

631
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,720
No.

632
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,760
This is where Mr. Hua lives and works.

633
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,880
Do you want me to show you around?

634
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,240
No.

635
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,640
Stool.

636
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,840
Come on.

637
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,240
Water.

638
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,600
Have some water.

639
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,240
Thanks.

640
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,040
Let me

641
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,240
introduce you.

642
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,360
They are police officers here.

643
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,680
They are Mr. Hua's

644
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,400
colleagues.

645
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,120
Introduce yourselves.

646
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,840
I'm Erbai.

647
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm Sun Hongfa.

648
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm Tian Dongbao.

649
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,320
Mr. Hua,

650
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm Chen Hao, the Captain.

651
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,880
Nice to meet you, Captain.

652
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,760
How is he?

653
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,400
I'm here

654
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,720
to tell you

655
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,040
about him.

656
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,200
Shanghai Garrison Command suspected him

657
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,280
of being a communist.

658
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,760
Comm...

659
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,280
Communist?

660
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,760
And they have

661
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,000
some evidence.

662
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,720
He can't be a communist.

663
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
They said they had

664
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,240
some evidence.

665
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,360
But I have no idea.

666
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,120
From what I know about my brother,

667
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
he would be the last to become a communist.

668
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,840
Yeah.

669
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,720
Fortunately,

670
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,680
Hua Zhen is optimistic.

671
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
He wanted me to tell you

672
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
that he was fine.

673
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Don't be upset.

674
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,040
Don't worry about him.

675
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,880
As his brother,

676
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,680
I would like to thank you

677
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,840
for taking care of him

678
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,600
for more than a month.

679
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,160
Thank you.

680
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,680
It's what we should do.

681
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,720
It's what we should do.

682
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,320
I hope you

683
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,000
don't get involved in this.

684
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,840
OK, that's all I wanted to say.

685
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,360
I've given you his message.

686
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,480
I won't bother you further.

687
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,600
See you.

688
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,000
Secretary Hua...

689
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,400
Secretary Hua...

690
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,000
You came from far,

691
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,320
why not have a cup of water?

692
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,400
What about...

693
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,000
Director, you are so kind.

694
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,880
Please stay.

695
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,200
Yes.

696
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,320
Mr. Hua.

697
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,600
Mr. Hua.

698
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,080
I want to say something to you.

699
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,360
Although he hasn't been here long,

700
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,960
we took him

701
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,280
as one of us.

702
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
If you need any help

703
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
from us,

704
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
feel free to come to us.

705
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,200
I hope he can

706
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,440
leave Shanghai safely.

707
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,080
I will.

708
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,200
Now I understand

709
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,880
why Hua Zhen

710
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,200
doesn't want to leave.

711
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,640
Captain Chen, thank you.

712
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,400
My pleasure.

713
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:09,960
Erbai,

714
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,200
pinch me.

715
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,560
Pince at me.

716
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,240
It was not a dream.

717
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,360
What an honor!

718
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,080
I never thought

719
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,840
I'd meet

720
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,480
the Secretary of the Office of Aides,

721
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,720
the son of the Undersecretary in my life.

722
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,640
He doesn't have

723
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,800
any air of superiority.

724
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,280
Talking to him

725
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,360
is like

726
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,280
dreaming of the autumn wind.

727
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,880
Dreaming of autumn wind?

728
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,720
Like bathing in the spring breeze?

729
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,440
By the way,

730
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,480
shouldn't we care

731
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,880
what to do to help Xiang Yuansheng?

732
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,160
Why bother?

733
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,000
His brother is here.

734
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,200
Director,

735
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,400
can his brother

736
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,080
ask the Command to release Xiang?

737
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,560
Girl,

738
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,680
do you know who the secretaries

739
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
of the Office of Aides are?

740
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,720
They serve Chairman Chiang

741
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,800
directly.

742
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Not to mention

743
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,920
that his dad is the Undersecretary of

744
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,080
the Ministry of Military Affairs.

745
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,240
Don't worry.

746
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,160
He will be all right.

747
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,880
You can be rest assured.

748
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,880
But he said the leader of

749
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,360
the investigation team has evidence.

750
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,160
Will that work?

751
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,520
Even if there was more evidence,

752
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,320
it would not work

753
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,600
as well as some people's words.

754
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,640
Do you feel that Xiang's brother

755
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,840
is better to get along with

756
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,880
than him?

757
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,480
I don't think so.

758
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,800
Listen to yourself.

759
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,920
Who once had grudge against

760
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,400
Xiang Yuansheng

761
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,200
at the beginning?

762
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,480
Who...

763
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Don't drink my water.

764
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,560
Don't...

765
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,200
I will put that mug in my collection.

766
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,800
Give it.

767
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,640
I borrowed the background documents

768
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,040
from the Public Security Bureau.

769
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,920
None of them are communists.

770
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,200
Have you investigated every one of them?

771
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:17,800
Yes.

772
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,040
Their relatives?

773
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,480
Investigated.

774
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,880
Could Chen Hao

775
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,640
ever intersect

776
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,520
with Hua Zhen

777
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,160
before?

778
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,240
Probably not.

779
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,040
He was born in a village

780
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,600
by the river in Fengxian.

781
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,360
His parents are both fishermen.

782
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,360
Neither of them could read.

783
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,560
He graduated from

784
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,320
the Zhejiang Police Academy.

785
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
He has been working as a policeman

786
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,680
in Shanghai since his graduation.

787
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
Judging by the background documents,

788
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,800
no connection

789
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,520
has been found

790
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,440
between the police station

791
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,400
and Deng Mingyuan.

792
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,880
Secretary Hua,

793
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,800
do you suspect that,

794
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,600
other than Deng Mingyuan,

795
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
there are other communists

796
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,680
around Hua Zhen?

797
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
My brother

798
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,720
is 24 years old.

799
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,080
Before coming to Shanghai,

800
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,160
he had not done anything

801
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,280
that exceeds what is proper.

802
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,400
I wonder

803
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,680
what magic power

804
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,960
this police station has.

805
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,720
How did it

806
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,520
take him off track step by step?

807
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm even more curious after reading this.

808
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Such a place.

809
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Such a group of people.

810
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,520
How did they attract him

811
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,040
so much?

812
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,680
Did Hua Liang surprise at

813
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,440
his setback?

814
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,160
Yes.

815
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,080
He requested to be present at the trial.

816
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,640
Secretary,

817
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,960
what should I do?

818
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,400
Do you know

819
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,800
what is the most important link

820
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,720
in a legal argument?

821
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,920
Evidence.

822
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,600
What if there is no evidence?

823
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,120
Secretary Guo,

824
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,720
if there is no evidence,

825
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,680
I will

826
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
get some.

827
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,720
Captain Wei.

828
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,960
Yes, Sir.

829
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,400
I've been trying to find

830
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,840
the right person to be my assistant

831
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,200
at the military prosecution.

832
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,280
The candidate has not been decided.

833
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,680
If you can

834
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,600
enrich your resume

835
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,920
by the end of the year,

836
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,760
maybe we will

837
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
work together at the military prosecution

838
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,720
after the New Year.

839
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,360
I...
