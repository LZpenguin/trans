3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,160
Who's after

4
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,360
the girl in the photo?

5
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,720
Officer, you must be joking.

6
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,040
This is a pawnshop.

7
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,360
I don't quite understand

8
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,440
what you're getting at.

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
You do.

10
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,480
Just a moment.

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,000
Going to call someone?

12
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,400
Just need to pee.

13
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,440
Hold it.

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,560
Yes.

15
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
Just two of them.

16
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,280
One looks like a rustic,

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
the other's in a police uniform.

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
Not sure what his deal is.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,720
Yes, they're here right now.

20
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,720
Haven't seen you two before.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,120
First time here?

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
Right.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
Then I'll assume

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,520
you don't understand the rules.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm paid

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,440
to find this girl.

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
I can't take any money

28
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
to give away my client.

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,520
No double deals from me.

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Even if your friend here

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,960
comes in uniform,

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
it makes no difference.

33
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,520
Quite a stickler for rules, aren't you?

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,240
But without answers,

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,480
we're not leaving today.

36
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,560
I know a few friends

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,680
in the Public Security Bureau, too.

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,440
May I ask, officer,

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,760
what's your background?

40
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
It would be a shame if we upset

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,440
each other unnecessarily.

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,160
From the Police Dept?

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
A police station?

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,520
Surely not just a station house?

45
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
Take them out! Both of them!

46
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,960
Get out!

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,880
Out!

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,600
Out!

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,440
You two rookies from some station house

50
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,800
burst into my shop in broad daylight,

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,720
breaking my rules.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
Did you ever think you might not walk out?

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,680
Deputy Hong.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,400
This is

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
Deputy Hong, from the

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,720
Shanghai Garrison Command.

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,920
If you have any requests,

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
you can talk to him.

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,920
This has nothing to do with him.

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,280
What sort of rookie bull do we have here,

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,440
reckless and foolish?

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,560
A local station officer?

63
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,960
You're just a local station stray dog.

64
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,320
What power are you trying to flex here?

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
Young man,

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
I've warned you.

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,400
How dare you mess with a place under

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Deputy Hong's watch?

69
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,720
Xiang Yuansheng!

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,200
Don't move! Stay still!

71
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,520
Put it down!

72
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,120
Don't move!

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Xiang Yuansheng!

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,200
Nobody move!

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,880
Get backup!

76
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,840
Call for backup!

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm not leaving

78
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
until this runt is dealt with!

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,240
Yes, Sir!

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,200
Some local station cop.

81
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,280
Have you ever used a gun before?

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,240
Is this your first time?

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,960
Know where you are?

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,480
This is...

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,840
this is Shanghai Garrison Command

86
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,520
territory!

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
You think you can just act up here?

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Listen up,

89
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,240
if you are to stir up trouble here,

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
you'd better check

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,000
if the Staff Chief agrees!

92
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,800
Alright then,

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
I'll check if he agrees.

94
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,440
[Hello.]

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,240
Connect me to the Shanghai Garrison Command.

96
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,200
I need to speak with Staff Chief Tong.

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,120
Director An.

98
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,000
Captain Wei, you are here too?

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
Has the Staff Chief returned yet?

100
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
No.

101
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm also waiting for him.

102
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,320
Hello?

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,960
Staff Chief Tong's office.

104
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,280
The Chief is out at a meeting.

105
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,520
This is Deputy An Yin speaking.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,840
[It's me, Xiang Yuansheng.]

107
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
Is this Hua Zhen?

108
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,000
Sorry

109
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,160
for the grudge with your men.

110
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,320
I understand.

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm heading over now.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Director An.

113
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,840
It's Mr. Hua, isn't it?

114
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,920
Has he

115
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,480
run into any trouble?

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,400
Captain Wei,

117
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
still so concerned about him, huh?

118
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,720
By the way,

119
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
has your investigation of Hua Zhen

120
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,360
been cleared?

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,280
Investigation?

122
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,280
I know

123
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,920
your men are scrutinizing

124
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
Hua Zhen lately.

125
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,480
It's merely a misunderstanding.

126
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,000
My last inquiry

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,640
about Mr. Hua

128
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,000
was purely out of personal curiosity.

129
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,080
We've already clarified

130
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,480
that tiny bit of mentorship connection

131
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,840
he had with Deng Mingyuan.

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,640
I see.

133
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,880
He is currently

134
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,920
with our

135
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,520
deputy's team,

136
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
and I'm about to meet him.

137
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,440
How about

138
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,800
joining me, Captain Wei,

139
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
adding some excitement?

140
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
No, no.

141
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,480
Our investigation team

142
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
is just swamped with work.

143
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
I really can't spare any time.

144
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,880
It's fine,

145
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,800
Director An.

146
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
How about this:

147
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,120
I'll pass on the documents

148
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
to Chief Tong for you.

149
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,200
You go ahead.

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,520
Don't keep your friend waiting.

151
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,200
Thanks for that.

152
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,120
Don't mention it.

153
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,360
Really not coming?

154
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,440
No.

155
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll pass.

156
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,120
Line up!

157
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
Line up!

158
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,040
Director An.

159
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,160
I won't go in.

160
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,480
Sort everything out,

161
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
then bring Deputy Hong.

162
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,800
Go on.

163
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,600
Yes, Sir!

164
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,680
Follow me!

165
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
Put the guns down!

166
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,680
Captain Jia,

167
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,360
what... what brings you here?

168
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Deputy Hong, flexing your authority

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,280
and calling in backup?

170
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,360
Is the Shanghai Garrison Command

171
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
run by you now?

172
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,360
No, no,

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,840
it's all a misunderstanding.

174
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,160
Director An is here as well?

175
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Why?

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,160
Were you expecting Director An

177
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,720
to personally summon you?

178
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,520
No, no, absolutely not.

179
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,920
It's all... It's all Mr. Fan's fault...

180
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,560
Take him away!

181
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,040
Yes, Sir!

182
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,520
Mr. Xiang, sorry for the trouble.

183
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,040
Director An

184
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,480
sent me to escort you out.

185
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,600
I apologize

186
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,280
for the confrontation with your people.

187
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,000
There were

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,360
urgent matters I needed to handle.

189
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,200
It's we who have inconvenienced you.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,880
About the urgent matter

191
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,680
you mentioned,

192
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,160
is there anything we can help with?

193
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,920
No need.

194
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
I can manage it on my own.

195
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,280
Everything will be fine.

196
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,320
Don't worry.

197
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,800
It seems the trouble is over then.

198
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,240
Alright,

199
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,280
I won't disturb you further.

200
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
Director An will be waiting for you outside.

201
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,840
Mr. Fan,

202
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
back to the matter at hand.

203
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,840
Who's looking

204
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,200
for the girl in this photo?

205
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,120
About half a month ago,

206
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,080
someone called our pawnshop

207
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,840
to set up this deal.

208
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,720
They sent the photo

209
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,840
and payment,

210
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,200
along with a phone number.

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
They instructed me to call that number

212
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,880
once I found the person.

213
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
I've never met them

214
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,800
in person.

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Don't even know

216
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,600
who they are.

217
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,320
So, you gave the address on Wangyun Road

218
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,520
to the person

219
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,320
who left the phone number?

220
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,120
That's right.

221
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,440
And where does that number lead?

222
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
Fetch the notebook.

223
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,680
Here it is.

224
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,440
Fuqingli No. 16.

225
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,200
The Shanghai Garrison Command?

226
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
I'll go over and say hi.

227
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,080
Thank you, An Yin.

228
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,840
Don't mention it.

229
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,440
You said, outside the Fourth Station that day,

230
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
once things settled down,

231
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,840
you'd explain everything to me.

232
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,560
Can you tell me

233
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,240
what exactly

234
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
brought you to Shanghai?

235
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,920
Have some fruits.

236
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
Can we speak privately?

237
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,680
It's fine.

238
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
He's a friend

239
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,080
and also an officer from the Fourth Station.

240
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
When I first arrived at Shanghai,

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,800
I inquired information from you.

242
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,040
You mean the Meng case?

243
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,880
Right.

244
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,160
A friend asked me to do him a favor.

245
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,280
Initially, I just planned

246
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,800
a couple of days in Shanghai,

247
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,560
but I came across something.

248
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,320
I didn't return Nanjing

249
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,520
because I wanted to

250
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
clear up this case.

251
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
What friend?

252
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,880
A friend from Nanjing.

253
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,720
You wouldn't know him.

254
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,840
I asked you once before,

255
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,040
and I need to

256
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,080
ask again.

257
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,800
Deng Mingyuan from the Navy Dept., a Communist,

258
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,200
does he have any connection

259
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,560
to this case you're investigating?

260
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,480
This is my own business.

261
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,000
It has

262
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,680
nothing to do with him

263
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
or my family.

264
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,600
Investigating cases

265
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
is the duty of policeman.

266
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,160
Why are you always

267
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
mixing with those low-tier cops?

268
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,040
Do you have any information on Deng Mingyuan?

269
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,160
Where is he being held?

270
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,040
You know nothing?

271
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Neither do I.

272
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,600
I rarely pay attention

273
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,920
to things outside the Deputy Office.

274
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
He's probably under investigation.

275
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,560
If there's any result,

276
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,600
it would be communicated internally.

277
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,200
Let me have a word with the shop owner.

278
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,560
Mr. Fan,

279
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
I have a favor to ask.

280
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
If anyone inquires

281
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,640
who gave you the address

282
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,920
for the girl on Wangyun Road,

283
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
just act as if you don't know.

284
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,400
Sorry for

285
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,680
the disruption to your business.

286
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,320
Here's some compensation.

287
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,440
No need.

288
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
How could I possibly take your money?

289
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,560
Well, I'll accept it.

290
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,720
What's your relation to the mahjong parlor?

291
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,320
That's irrelevant.

292
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,200
It's just about protecting an innocent family.

293
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,800
I don't want to drag them into this.

294
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
Shall we

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,320
grab a meal together?

296
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,280
There's a new Italian restaurant

297
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,560
near the Garrison Command

298
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,040
that offers good food.

299
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,720
No, thanks.

300
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,240
Aren't you

301
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,720
a fan of Italian food?

302
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,280
You've done enough for me already.

303
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,560
You realize that, huh?

304
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Seriously though,

305
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,040
does he

306
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,440
know you're a military academy student?

307
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,160
He doesn't.

308
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,880
I heard

309
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,440
you made it into the elite class.

310
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,840
Getting involved in brawls off-campus.

311
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,400
If the academy finds that out,

312
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,680
you could face serious disciplinary actions.

313
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,320
Not just rejected by the elite class,

314
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,680
but kicked out of the academy altogether.

315
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
Did you think about that before you came here?

316
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,440
I did.

317
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,200
But I couldn't worry about that anymore.

318
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,120
Hua Zhen,

319
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,560
I consider you as my brother,

320
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,880
and helping you out

321
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,320
is no big deal for me.

322
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,800
But if I ever find out

323
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,720
you have any ties to Deng Mingyuan,

324
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,560
then let's not see each other anymore.

325
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,800
You can go now.

326
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,400
Director,

327
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,600
is he your friend?

328
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,400
Yes,

329
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,560
my best friend from Army University.

330
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,360
I always admired

331
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,200
his cool head and discipline.

332
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,680
Lately, I just can't make sense of him anymore.

333
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,200
How about some food?

334
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,560
Sure.

335
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,080
What do you want to eat?

336
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,960
Anything.

337
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,440
Whatever you usually have

338
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
is fine with me.

339
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,720
Then I'll show you a really good place.

340
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,840
Captain Chen is here.

341
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,960
How're you doing?

342
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,080
Captain Chen!

343
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,680
Hi.

344
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,440
Captain Chen, welcome.

345
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,040
Table for two.

346
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,080
Sure.

347
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,000
Sit.

348
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,040
This is the good place you said?

349
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,520
Give it a try.

350
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,160
Haven't eaten at a place like this before?

351
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,360
You used to work

352
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,720
for the Shanghai Garrison Command?

353
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Not exactly.

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,560
Gentlemen,

355
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,720
here are your noodles.

356
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,600
Enjoy your meal.

357
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,640
Have a try.

358
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,720
Boss,

359
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm leaving the money here.

360
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,280
Smells pretty good.

361
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
It's even better with vinegar.

362
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,080
Vinegar,

363
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,800
boss.

364
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,200
Here, give it to me.

365
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
I don't like vinegar.

366
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
Take mine.

367
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,640
You mentioned the Communist

368
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,720
Deng Mingyuan.

369
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you know him?

370
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,440
He was my teacher.

371
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,520
Why?

372
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
Nothing. Just asking.

373
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,320
You're not going to eat?

374
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,560
I'm eating.

375
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,160
Is it delicious?

376
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,560
Not bad.

377
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,280
Your treat.

378
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,920
Who?

379
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,760
You.

380
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,920
I give all my money to pawnbroker.

381
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,840
Naughty boy.

382
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,520
I'm going.

383
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
[OK, welcome next time.]

384
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,320
Where is the previous gatekeeper?

385
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,920
Well,

386
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720
I don't know,

387
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,080
Officer.

388
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,120
I just began to work here.

389
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,960
The last gatekeeper...

390
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,560
Who told you to change the gatekeeper?

391
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,120
I registered in

392
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,240
in an employment agency.

393
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,120
The agency asked me to come,

394
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,760
so here I am.

395
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,160
I want the guest register of this building.

396
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,480
We have it.

397
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,040
Now!

398
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,840
I'm on it.

399
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,840
From the previous gatekeeper.

400
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,760
In the apartment,

401
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
besides Hua Zhen,

402
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,200
there should also live a girl.

403
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,320
Why didn't you register her?

404
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Officer,

405
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,240
I'm new here

406
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,600
and I really don't know

407
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,320
what happened before me.

408
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,080
Sir, someone cleared out the room.

409
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,840
Feng Sir,

410
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,560
I've been to Dongguang pawnshop.

411
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,080
All get out.

412
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,880
Yes, sir.

413
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,040
It's pawnbroker

414
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,960
who gave this address

415
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
to Nakamura's subordinate,

416
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
but he said the address

417
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,240
had been written on a note

418
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,800
and slipped under the door

419
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
of the pawnshop.

420
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
He didn't see who it was.

421
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,640
But there were other cops

422
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,440
besides us

423
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,720
who asked about it today.

424
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,440
Who?

425
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,560
Staff of the Fourth Station House,

426
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,880
one surnamed Chen and the other surnamed Xiang.

427
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,880
They asked

428
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,400
who is looking for

429
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,640
the girl in the photo.

430
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,320
The pawnbroker

431
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,360
gave them

432
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,200
the phone number and address.

433
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,880
No. 16 Fuqingli?

434
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,760
Yes.

435
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,720
Hello?

436
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,240
[Hello.]

437
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,120
[Is this]

438
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,320
[No. 23, Wangyun Road?]

439
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,880
Yes.

440
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Who are you?

441
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm the Second Secretary of Office of Aides.

442
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,680
Who's speaking?

443
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,320
Second Secretary of Office of Aides?

444
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,560
I'm the Chairman Jiang.

445
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,200
Hello?

446
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,400
Hey!

447
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,480
What's up, Liang?

448
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,280
I wanted to call Hua Zhen

449
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,120
and asked when he would be back.

450
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
But the phone number

451
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
seems to be wrong.

452
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,760
Secretary.

453
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,800
Every day I'm here wiping butts.

454
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
constantly cleaning up the mess

455
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,760
they leave behind.

456
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,440
They're up front,

457
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,040
constantly causing me trouble.

458
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,520
What do they think I am, a nanny?

459
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
Sir, sir.

460
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,760
Thank you.

461
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Good day.

462
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Something went wrong to Zhang.

463
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,920
What happened?

464
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,880
I went to his house,

465
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,840
and if he had come back safely,

466
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,040
he would put the flowerpot on the windowsill,

467
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,360
as usual.

468
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,080
But I found

469
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,040
there was no security signal.

470
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,040
Anything abnormal

471
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,760
before he went to the hospital?

472
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,200
No, he was conscious.

473
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,880
He said he would go home

474
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
after treating the wound.

475
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,720
Junyu,

476
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,120
we have to prepare

477
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,280
for the worst situation.

478
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,280
The gatekeeper of Qiushi's apartment

479
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,600
knew her and Xiang Yuansheng.

480
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm afraid of troubles after that,

481
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,560
so I changed the gatekeeper.

482
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,760
Zhang gave this to Xiang Yuansheng

483
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,080
before he went to the hospital.

484
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,280
He wanted to leave us clues.

485
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,240
The murderer used this dagger

486
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,560
to stab his leg.

487
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,120
I had it checked.

488
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,720
It's FS dagger,

489
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,800
a popular

490
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,480
patrol dagger.

491
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,960
The murderer

492
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,760
must have gotten it

493
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,840
through a private source.

494
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,120
I'll check with the Municipal Council.

495
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,160
The lost records of this dagger

496
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,520
should be found soon.

497
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,760
I left Zhang in the apartment

498
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,000
to protect Qiushi.

499
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,080
I worked with him for five years.

500
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,480
He helped me through numerous difficulties.

501
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,080
But I couldn't protect him.

502
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,520
How did he die?

503
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
We used too much torture.

504
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,520
Never excuse.

505
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,840
Did he have anything

506
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,360
with him?

507
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,280
It's all there.

508
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,440
This

509
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,320
was tied to his wound.

510
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Tied on the wound?

511
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,760
Correct.

512
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,640
Probably,

513
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,240
it belongs to the cop

514
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,320
who took him to the hospital?

515
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,480
Are you kidding me?

516
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Impossible.

517
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Look at this belt.

518
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,160
This belt buckle alone

519
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,240
is worth six months' pay

520
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,480
of a cop.

521
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,640
[Shunchang.]

522
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,640
Hurry and organize personnel

523
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,800
to help me look into

524
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,080
all the high-end clothing stores

525
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,640
and leather shops

526
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,840
that bear the name Shunchang.

527
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,720
All over Shanghai?

528
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,320
No,

529
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,960
check Nanjing

530
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,800
first.

531
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,560
You're back, Captain Chen.

532
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
Are you cooking?

533
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
You're back, Captain Chen.

534
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,040
Yeah, I'm off duty.

535
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,880
This Chinese medicine has such a strong odor.

536
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,080
[One more, please.]

537
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
[Off duty, Captain Chen?]

538
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,080
[Back home, bro?]

539
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,760
[You're back, Captain Chen.]

540
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,960
Leek, I know you like it.

541
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,440
It smells so good.

542
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,960
I'll keep one for you.

543
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,480
Ok.

544
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,120
I'll call you later.

545
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,040
Thank you.

546
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,760
Xiaomei,

547
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,800
boil a few more.

548
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
[Captain Chen,]

549
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,400
[come over.]

550
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
[Come.]

551
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,640
[Back, Captain Chen?]

552
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,760
[You play cards every day.]

553
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,320
[You bet.]

554
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,400
[Don't you care about anything at home.]

555
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,760
[It's okay, let him play.]

556
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,800
[It's your fault.]

557
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,760
[You set a bad example.]

558
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,800
[Don't get addicted. Go!]

559
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,640
Come on in.

560
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,080
You can't live in the apartment anymore.

561
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,280
You can live with me.

562
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,080
Just make do with it.

563
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,840
There are two

564
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,240
rooms of similar size.

565
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I'll get you a glass of water.

566
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,080
[Captain Chen,]

567
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,840
[dumpling is ready, come and eat.]

568
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,080
I'm coming.

569
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
Drink some water.

570
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,280
Sister.

571
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,320
Are two pans enough?

572
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,280
Come again if not.

573
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,760
It is enough.

574
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,360
Please feel free to ask.

575
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,200
Thank you.

576
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,720
Eat dumplings.

577
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,160
Is that book again?

578
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,680
You do like the book, right?

579
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,160
You carry the book with you.

580
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,600
What does this mean?

581
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,240
Its literal translation is

582
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,280
Moment for Human to Make Choice.

583
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,360
The person who gave me this book said

584
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,080
it also can be translated into

585
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,040
Decisive Moments in History.

586
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,160
Have a look?

587
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,080
And this?

588
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,880
The greatest fortune in life

589
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,400
is to discover one's destination

590
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,800
when still in his prime.

591
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,480
-You've finished it all?
-I did.

592
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,760
What is it talking about?

593
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,840
Moments.

594
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,800
Some decisive moments

595
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,880
that change human history,

596
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,200
are also decisive moments of lifetime.

597
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,920
Let me read for you.

598
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,720
[Such dramatic]

599
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,000
[and fateful moments]

600
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,880
[are rare]

601
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,560
[in an individual's life]

602
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,640
[and in the course of history.]

603
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,000
[And such moments]

604
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,680
[often occur only on a single day,]

605
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,400
[at a single hour,]

606
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,600
[and even]

607
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,120
[at a single minute.]

608
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
[But their decisive impact]

609
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,720
[extends beyond time.]

610
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,240
[I want to review such decisive]

611
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,440
[and shining moments]

612
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,520
[in different eras]

613
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,400
[and regions]

614
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,960
[in this book.]

615
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,400
[I call them so]

616
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,720
[because they are]

617
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,240
[like stars,]

618
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,760
[radiating their light forever]

619
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,840
[and illuminating]

620
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,880
[the vanishing darkness,]

621
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,640
As the author

622
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,200
wrote the words in the preface.

623
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,960
Anyone home?

624
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,440
I'm coming.

625
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Captain Chen,

626
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,040
I just heard from someone in the alley that

627
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,640
you got a roommate.

628
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,640
I have to register it

629
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,760
according to the regulations.

630
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
You know

631
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,440
how strict the management is now.

632
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,240
A friend of mine

633
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,320
will stay here for a few days.

634
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,160
Can you show me

635
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,200
his ID certificate?

636
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480
My peer.

637
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,560
Captain Chen,

638
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,520
I'll go to the Household Registration Section

639
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,480
to cross check it.

640
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm leaving.

641
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,280
He is a new recruit

642
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,960
of the Fourth Station this year.

643
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,240
His identification

644
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,440
has been confirmed to be fine.

645
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
By whom?

646
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,760
Me.

647
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,400
Alright then.

648
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,960
See you.

649
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,760
Bye.

650
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,240
The dumplings are getting cold. Let's eat

651
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,680
When did you know

652
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I use a fake ID?

653
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,680
From the very beginning.

654
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,800
Since I came to the Fourth Station?

655
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,920
Almost.

656
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,200
Back at Wenhua Hotel,

657
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,640
in addition to Li Qiushi's parents,

658
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,640
there was

659
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,840
a 20-year-old man got killed.

660
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,360
The ID is his.

661
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,200
He was Xiang Yuansheng.

662
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
The real Xiang Yuansheng

663
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,400
is a missing person.

664
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,720
He has been missing for over three years.

665
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,240
No immediate family in Shanghai,

666
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,640
and his landlord

667
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,600
is his only

668
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,920
stakeholder.

669
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,400
The court has passed

670
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
the landlord's application

671
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,360
and declared the man dead.

672
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,080
But his household registration file

673
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,960
has not been cancelled yet.

674
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
How do you know this?

675
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,640
On the way out of the pawnshop,

676
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,400
you asked me if I knew Deng Mingyuan.

677
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,920
And you?

678
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
You know him?

679
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,760
No.

680
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,600
You said this certificate

681
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
was entrusted to you by a friend.

682
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,120
Whoever gave it to you,

683
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
I think he trusted you enough

684
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,960
to give it to you.

685
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,000
I knew a person

686
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,760
who believed in me very much,

687
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,600
and he said I could be a good cop.

688
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,800
I think

689
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,640
when he said that,

690
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
it was a decisive moment for me.

691
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
I just don't know

692
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,680
if I'll ever see him again.

693
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,240
Come in.

694
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,960
Warden Liu.

695
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,720
Staff Chief Tong.

696
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,480
When did you arrive at Shanghai?

697
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,760
Just arrived this afternoon.

698
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,040
The Ministry of Military Affairs has decided

699
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,240
to extradite Deng Mingyuan to Nanjing,

700
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,000
and transfer him to the Central Military Prison.

701
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,560
Mr. He ordered me

702
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,360
to handle the relevant procedure in person.

703
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,200
Here is the handover paperwork.

704
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,320
I got a call from Mr. He.

705
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,160
Is there a verdict on Deng?

706
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,240
Not yet,

707
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,000
but Navy Dept. has confirmed that

708
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,880
he is linked with a leak case

709
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,360
three years ago.

710
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,520
His death penalty

711
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,200
is only a matter of time.

712
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,680
Go,

713
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,200
and handle procedures for the Warden.

714
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,680
Yes, sir.

715
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,480
This is handover paperwork.

716
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,720
He's even in the mood to paint.

717
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,320
What kind of boat is it?

718
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,480
Take him to verification,

719
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,800
and make an inventory of his items.

720
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,840
All his carry-on items are here.

721
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,720
Have a check.

722
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,720
This way.

723
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,760
Comrade 037,

724
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,840
I'm ordered

725
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,960
by the Nanjing underground party

726
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,800
to rescue you now.

727
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,600
Step on it.

728
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,000
We'll take action

729
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
before you're handed over to Nanjing.

730
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,640
The handcuff key will be delivered to you.

731
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,200
The first yard time in tomorrow afternoon.

732
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,600
You go near the southeast sentry post,

733
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,480
which is

734
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,920
a blind spot of the watchtower.

735
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,480
A rope will be thrown down there,

736
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,640
and when the guards are distracted,

737
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,360
you must get rid of

738
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,480
the man in the booth,

739
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,320
and get over the wall.

740
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,440
Our comrade

741
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,120
will meet you outside.

742
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,400
Teach him a lesson.

743
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,240
I want him not to go against me

744
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,600
forever.

745
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,280
Keep him alive or not?
