00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,200
Shooting Stars EP21

3
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,640
Young master.

4
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,040
I ‘ve talked to

5
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
your brother

6
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,120
on the phone.

7
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,520
You didn't pass the political check.

8
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,160
So you can't join the elite class.

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,400
Someone else

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,920
took the spot.

11
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
Although you were acquitted

12
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
of Wei Daiqing's accusation,

13
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,080
the school took it seriously.

14
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,720
The Chairman himself proposed

15
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
the opening of the elite class.

16
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,400
So,

17
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,600
the political check is strict.

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,600
I know.

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,760
Of course, you still have a chance.

20
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,800
But given that the aftermath of that event wears on,

21
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,880
It's better to stay cautious.

22
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
When it

23
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
blows over,

24
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,720
I'll find a way for you.

25
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,480
What's more,

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,240
Dad has talked

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,480
with your principal.

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,120
When you go to ocean training

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
next semester,

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,080
he'll make you Second Mate.

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,800
Though you can't join the elite class,

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,320
but

33
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,880
you don't have to be a sailor,

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,640
right?

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,440
What about the original Second Mate?

36
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
What do you mean?

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,760
The one

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,640
I'm going to replace.

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,200
We don't know him.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,440
Why bother?

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
The school will

42
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,240
take care of him.

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,200
You don't need to worry about him.

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,960
Brother,

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,800
do you remember

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
I asked you

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,160
to help me get a position

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,680
in the Fourth Station House

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,960
when I was in Shanghai?

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,800
If I hadn't cut the line,

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
an officer's brother

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,680
would have joined

53
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,200
the Fourth Station House.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,160
It seems, I always

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,280
take opportunities away from others.

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,840
My father told me

57
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,400
never

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,080
steal another's opportunity.

59
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,920
Because it would change

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,640
more than

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
our own life paths.

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,000
But, I think the opportunity

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
belongs to

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,240
the people who can seize it.

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
Opportunity makes

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
geniuses

67
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
and heroes.

68
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,960
It's bad luck

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,440
that gets people in trouble.

70
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,920
From now on, no one is allowed

71
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,920
to mention Xiang Yuansheng

72
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,440
in my house.

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,680
Help yourself.

74
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,040
Go on.

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,640
Take this.

76
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,520
Have some fruits.

77
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,400
Why are you so behaved?

78
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,520
Like a visitor.

79
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Yeah,

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,800
I've been long gone.

81
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,680
Mrs. Liu cleans your room every day

82
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,080
and doesn't touch anything.

83
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,680
The room is

84
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,080
exactly as you left it.

85
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
Give me your wallet.

86
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
What do you want?

87
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,200
Just give it.

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
At home,

89
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
you have drivers

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,040
and servants at your service.

91
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,400
You don't need money.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I'll keep it for you

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
and I'll give it back

94
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,080
when you return to school.

95
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
In case you run away again.

96
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,560
It's 160 silver dollars.

97
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,080
I want it back then.

98
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,520
When you are ready,

99
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,920
I'll take you back to school.

100
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,080
Have some fruits.

101
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,680
Dad,

102
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,680
are you heading for M.M.A.?

103
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,320
Hua Zhen is going back to school.

104
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,240
I took time off to drop him off at school

105
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
and will return later.

106
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,200
Take him for a haircut on the way.

107
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,640
Look at him.

108
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,720
He doesn't look like a soldier at all.

109
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,960
Remember not to cause any trouble

110
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
for your family

111
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,400
with your personal issues.

112
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,240
Zhen,

113
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,840
I had Mrs. Liu prepared some food

114
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,920
and daily necessities.

115
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Your brother will

116
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
take them with you.

117
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,880
If you need anything,

118
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,200
just call us.

119
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes, mom.

120
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
One more thing.

121
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
Mom,

122
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,080
I'll tell him about it.

123
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,280
OK.

124
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,440
Take care.

125
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
Are you going to the barbershop?

126
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,960
No.

127
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,200
People may mistake

128
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,800
Dad for your commanding officer.

129
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,800
Why,

130
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,840
can't you care about him

131
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
once in a while?

132
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Say something nice.

133
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,080
He would return the care.

134
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,680
The communication between people

135
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,400
is mutual.

136
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,400
I don't know what to say to him.

137
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,800
Say whatever you want.

138
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,680
Whatever you said to me,

139
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,920
say that again to him.

140
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,600
I know.

141
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
When you were little,

142
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,640
you didn't see him often.

143
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,480
He was on a war.

144
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,440
Dad took me with him.

145
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,560
Mom had to take care of family elders.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,280
They got no choice

147
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
but kept you at home alone.

148
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,760
Noted?

149
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
You know what?

150
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,480
Before I went to Shanghai,

151
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,280
Dad talked to Chief Tong

152
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,240
on the phone for an hour.

153
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,920
Do you think

154
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
I was able to postpone the trial for three days?

155
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,120
You're the Secretary.

156
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
Of course you can.

157
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Let me finish.

158
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,920
I'm being serious.

159
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,480
I just don't know

160
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
what to talk to him.

161
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,400
When I was a kid,

162
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
I wished he would stay at home.

163
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,840
Now, things turned out quite the opposite.

164
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,160
If me and him at home,

165
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,000
I will feel uncomfortable.

166
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,880
I'd rather stay in my room

167
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,480
all day

168
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
and not see him.

169
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,400
Have a smoke.

170
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,640
I don't smoke.

171
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,960
I thought you learned to smoke

172
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,280
in Shanghai.

173
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
It will be all right.

174
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
After your graduation,

175
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,200
you have enough time to get along well with him.

176
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,280
We are family.

177
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,920
Family is complicated.

178
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Well.

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,760
One day, I accompanied Mom to the home of

180
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,640
Vice President Jia of the Executive Office

181
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,480
to play mahjong.

182
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
His granddaughter was there.

183
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,280
She graduated from Ginling College.

184
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,440
Do you know her?

185
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Do you remember her?

186
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,480
No.

187
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,200
Really?

188
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,000
Shall I

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
introduce you to her.

190
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,680
You may want to write to her

191
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
at school.

192
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,680
No, thanks.

193
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I don't like to write letters.

194
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,640
Don't be so absolute in what you say

195
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,120
before

196
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
you meet her.

197
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,880
I can't remember faces.

198
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,320
You must be thinking about

199
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,960
the policewoman in Shanghai.

200
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,000
Miss Luo told me

201
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,200
you talked a lot that night.

202
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,560
You went from small talk

203
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,720
to ideals.

204
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,440
I was shocked.

205
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
If I'm right, except for me,

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,400
you never talk so much

207
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,200
to any other people, right?

208
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,280
And

209
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,640
Do you hit it off well?

210
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,760
Did she say that?

211
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,840
In my opinion,

212
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,520
the intimacy between people

213
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
begins with small talk.

214
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
About Vice President Jia's granddaughter,

215
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,280
whom I mentioned on the way,

216
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,960
Mom attempted

217
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,760
to tell you about her

218
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,240
before we left.

219
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,080
Our parents have arranged

220
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,320
your marriage to her.

221
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,440
Brother,

222
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,600
are you kidding me?

223
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,360
Vice President Jia and Dad

224
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,000
had a deep discussion

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
about your future.

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,720
Vice President Jia

227
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,680
needs our support.

228
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,480
You

229
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,760
need a backer

230
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,160
in the Party.

231
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,360
So they have

232
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,000
arranged

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,920
your marriage.

234
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,680
Vice President Jia and Dad

235
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,920
discussed my future?

236
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,840
Hua Zhen,

237
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,320
I think

238
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
you need the marriage,

239
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,400
especially because of where you are.

240
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,120
Luo Minmin

241
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,920
is simple and nice.

242
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,960
But she is

243
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
too simple and too ordinary.

244
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,960
You will not have a future.

245
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,440
Brother,

246
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,440
I haven't even met

247
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,960
Vice President Jia.

248
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,400
How could they

249
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,920
discuss my future

250
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,360
and decide my life?

251
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,120
Your life

252
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,200
has already been planned.

253
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,000
You are going to

254
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
assist the Chairman

255
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,880
in building a Revolutionary Navy.

256
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,760
Your romance

257
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,040
with Luo Minmin

258
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
is like a spring dream

259
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,960
that leaves no trace.

260
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,600
Your romance in summer

261
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,280
will disappear

262
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,920
before winter

263
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,880
comes.

264
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,960
All right.

265
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
Remember to call home.

266
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,200
Do you remember these photos?

267
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,560
This photo

268
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
was taken by a reporter

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,400
of the National Salvation Organization.

270
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,240
You know the person on the right.

271
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
Tan Shiyuan, the Deputy Director.

272
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,920
The identity of the man on the left

273
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,120
with the wine glass remains unknown.

274
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,400
The man in the middle is Nakamura Naoki.

275
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,960
He's running

276
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,600
Hongji Benevolent Society in Shanghai.

277
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,200
And

278
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
he was rated as a law-abiding citizen

279
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,600
by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

280
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,160
It was published in the newspapers

281
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,520
when Tan Shiyuan gave him

282
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,200
the reward.

283
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,920
I remember that news.

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,960
Police officers often go to

285
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
Hongji Benevolent Society

286
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,160
to keep the refugees in order.

287
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,640
They were sent by Feng Guangyun.

288
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,400
The photo was shot by a Shenbao reporter.

289
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,280
His name is Peng Ganwen.

290
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,240
We just got the information

291
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,720
that he and his wife, Yao Xiulin,

292
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,640
have disappeared.

293
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
It may have something to do with

294
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,880
Tan Shiyuan and the Japanese.

295
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,680
The organization ordered us

296
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,640
to locate them.

297
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,840
According to intelligence,

298
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,040
Feng Guangyun of the Shiliupu Station

299
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,600
may have something to do

300
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,920
with it.

301
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,000
You need to

302
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,160
get into the station

303
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
and find

304
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,280
concrete evidence and

305
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,160
probe into his real intentions.

306
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,560
Considerate

307
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
it done.

308
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,680
Stay safe.

309
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,080
No worries.

310
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,120
It's freezing in here.

311
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
It's about closing time.

312
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,160
Hurry up.

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,800
They don't even turn off the lights.

314
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
Shit in their heads.

315
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,160
Did you lock it?

316
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,480
I did.

317
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,920
This.

318
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,480
Let's go.

319
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
Let's go get a drink.

320
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,160
Can't wait.

321
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,040
You got me drunk last time.

322
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,280
I will get you drunk today.

323
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,240
Cleaner,

324
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,120
remember to turn off the lights.

325
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,520
The organization was right.

326
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,920
I found Mrs. Peng's medical record

327
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,960
in Feng Guangyun's office.

328
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,120
He must

329
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,560
be part of it.

330
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,320
What is

331
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,160
our next task?

332
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,080
Mr. Peng is a member of the NSO.

333
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,800
He writes news

334
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,600
and collects stories

335
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,480
for Shenbao Newspaper.

336
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
He discovered the relation of Hongji Benevolent Society

337
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,840
and Nakamura Naoki by accident.

338
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
The NSO feared

339
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,400
he was murdered.

340
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,880
What else

341
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,800
did he take in his photo shots

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,000
besides the three?

343
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,680
He gave the photo

344
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,320
to the National Salvation Organization.

345
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,120
And had been to

346
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,200
the Shiliupu Wharf several times.

347
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,440
Before he reported to

348
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,600
the National Salvation Organization,

349
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,640
he disappeared.

350
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
No one knows

351
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,880
what happened to him

352
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,800
at the wharf.

353
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,360
Superiors want you to investigate

354
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,480
from inside.

355
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
I will put you

356
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,160
in the Criminal Investigation Department,

357
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,440
lurking beside Feng Guangyun.

358
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
The Shiliupu Wharf

359
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,240
is Feng Guangyun's territory.

360
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,720
It's safer

361
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,680
for you

362
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,640
and the Fourth Station.

363
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,680
Got it.

364
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,600
This is for you.

365
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,240
For me?

366
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,880
Yes, it's your tuition.

367
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
We can't keep meeting each other

368
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,560
in secret.

369
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,680
People will get the wrong idea.

370
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
What wrong idea?

371
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,680
Bro,

372
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,480
buy a flower for the lady.

373
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,000
No, thanks.

374
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,520
She is beautiful.

375
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,920
Buy one for her.

376
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Here you are.

377
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
Thank you, Miss.

378
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,720
What a coincidence.

379
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,240
Now you see it.

380
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,240
Me and you?

381
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,080
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

382
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,920
But we can't always meet

383
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,400
in the same place.

384
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,920
I teach French

385
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
in the French Concession

386
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,240
church.

387
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,760
It's a place open to everyone

388
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
and Chinese police men are frequent there.

389
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
You go there for classes.

390
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,040
But I have no knowledge of French.

391
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,920
That's why you should come.

392
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,640
You can say

393
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
that you went to learn French

394
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,440
to deal with people

395
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,040
in the French Concession.

396
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,720
It's a safer way

397
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
for us to meet.

398
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,240
Got it.

399
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,280
Here's your tuition

400
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,400
and teaching aids fee.

401
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,680
Don't be late

402
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,440
for next week's class.

403
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,400
I have to go.

404
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,920
Do you want this?

405
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,320
It's yours now.

406
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,920
1, 2, 1.

407
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,880
1, 2, 3, 4.

408
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,920
1, 2, 3, 4.

409
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,760
1, 2, 1.

410
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,120
1, 2, 1.

411
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,240
I can't hear you.

412
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,240
1, 2, 1.

413
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,280
1, 2, 3.

414
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,240
That's it.

415
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,040
Do you have an eye for beauty?

416
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,440
Hua Zhen,

417
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
tell them.

418
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,200
Look.

419
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
How is this girl?

420
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,320
Come on.

421
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,520
He's never held a woman's hand.

422
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,560
It's useless to ask him.

423
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,360
Right?

424
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,400
Hua Zhen,

425
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,240
what kind of girl do you like?

426
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,400
Yeah, do you have a photo?

427
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
Show us.

428
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,120
Letter collecting!

429
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,400
Hurry up.

430
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,440
I got one.

431
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,920
Be quick.

432
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,760
On my way.

433
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,520
Anyone home?

434
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,920
Is anyone in the room?

435
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,920
How can I help you?

436
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,800
I want to report a missing person.

437
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,640
My husband's name is Peng Ganwen.

438
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,320
He's a reporter.

439
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,880
About half a month ago,

440
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
he asked me to move

441
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,960
to the hotel alone.

442
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,000
And I'd never reach him ever since.

443
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You know

444
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,720
as a reporter,

445
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
he often discloses

446
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,720
someone else's news.

447
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,440
I'm afraid

448
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,040
that he's in trouble.

449
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,600
Disclosing news?

450
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,840
Do you know what news

451
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,520
is your husband reporting?

452
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,720
He's composing

453
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,040
a report about refugees

454
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,360
and now collecting material.

455
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,560
Some days ago,

456
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,400
he visited Shiliupu Wharf

457
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,440
and took some pictures.

458
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,800
OK,

459
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,120
I've written down your words.

460
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,680
We will

461
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,840
enter investigation procedure tomorrow.

462
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,080
By the way,

463
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,760
can you leave your address?

464
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,680
No.5, Shiliu Lane, Jifu Road.

465
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,240
What should I call you?

466
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,160
Just call me Mrs. Peng.

467
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,600
Got it.

468
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,520
If you recall

469
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,640
any detail about the case,

470
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,320
report to the Fourth Station.

471
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,680
If it's not working hours,

472
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,120
come to find me at my home.

473
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm Luo Minmin,

474
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,400
living at No.39,

475
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
Xihua Lane, Nan District.

476
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,000
Luo's photo studio,

477
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,160
is my father's property.

478
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,200
Thank you, Officer Luo.

479
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,720
Never mind, goodbye.

480
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,080
Mrs. Xu, letter from your son.

481
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
My son wrote me a letter again.

482
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,280
Officer Luo.

483
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
Any letters for the station house?

484
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,200
Yes.

485
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,280
I'm about to send you letters

486
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,200
after delivering others.

487
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,560
Where are those lazybones?

488
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,120
Why do you

489
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,560
get mails on your own recently?

490
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,120
They are

491
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,080
still busy working.

492
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,720
What are they working for?

493
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Busy drinking tea and reading newspapers.

494
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,000
Huang,

495
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,760
are these

496
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,160
all the letters we get?

497
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,640
Yes.

498
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
I will double check

499
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,480
in post office.

500
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,360
Never mind.

501
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,840
Thank you Huang.

502
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,480
You're welcome.

503
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,000
Director.

504
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
They haven't come back from shopping.

505
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,680
Hongfa,

506
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,760
grab me some water.

507
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,280
OK.

508
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm exhausted this morning.

509
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,000
Oh my god.

510
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,600
Well,

511
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,440
what do you want for lunch?

512
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,600
Let Director cook for us.

513
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,680
Anything will do.

514
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,280
Minmin, what about you?

515
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,120
Minmin.

516
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,320
Minmin.

517
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,080
She's missing Yuansheng.

518
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,120
I'll go on duty outside.

519
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,840
We're going with you.

520
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,280
Together.

521
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,000
Aren't you

522
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
just coming back?

523
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,480
You should

524
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,200
have a rest first.

525
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
Are you tired?

526
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,280
No.

527
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,520
See, we are good.

528
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,040
Captain told me

529
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
we're recruiting new constables.

530
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,440
He will assign

531
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,120
the greatest one

532
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,280
to be my partner.

533
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,000
Don't worry.

534
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,720
I can go on duty

535
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,800
by myself.

536
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,240
The greatest partner.

537
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,240
Who else can be better than us?

538
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,600
Nobody.

539
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,120
Is there?

540
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,840
No.

541
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,360
I can't find anybody

542
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,760
better than us.

543
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,280
Nobody.

544
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,760
Nowhere.

545
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
Don't be still.

546
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,280
Let's go.

547
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,000
We're the best.

548
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Officer,

549
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,360
Mr. Peng and his wife

550
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,560
are not living here.

551
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,720
Do you know

552
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,280
where had they gone?

553
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,200
They just

554
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,080
paid me rents for three months.

555
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,680
But they

556
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,080
only lived here for ten days

557
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
and never came back.

558
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,960
That's weird.

559
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,600
Why didn't you

560
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,720
register on tenant information?

561
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,600
Officer,

562
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,240
it's hard to

563
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,840
keep the book updated.

564
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,800
so I...

565
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,800
Just this time.

566
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,000
We are from the Fourth Station.

567
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,160
If the tenement comes back,

568
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,280
don't forget to inform us.

569
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,720
OK.

570
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,680
Goodbye.

571
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,280
Take care.

572
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,640
Why do so many

573
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
policemen come here?

574
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,800
Captain,

575
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,160
I have something to report.

576
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,280
Do you know

577
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,960
a reporter named Peng Ganwen?

578
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,560
What's wrong?

579
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,160
His wife just reported

580
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,640
his disappearance to us.

581
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,400
These days

582
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,040
I've been working on it,

583
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,880
but still find no clues.

584
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,320
Captain,

585
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,760
have you been to the Shiliu Lane?

586
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,400
I had been there,

587
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,480
but for household registration.

588
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,960
I never heard about any reporter.

589
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,920
I went there just know.

590
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,040
But the landlord

591
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,960
said they hadn't lived there

592
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,400
for a while.

593
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,560
So I feel strange.

594
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,920
You?

595
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,920
You, Erbai and others?

596
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,560
Did Mrs. Peng

597
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
leave her contact information?

598
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,440
How to find her?

599
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,840
She only left an address.

600
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,800
You leave it to me.

601
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,680
I'll take charge of it.

602
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,360
OK.

603
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,200
Go ahead.

604
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,240
OK.

605
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,160
Superiors want you to investigate it

606
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,280
as a member of police force.

607
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,120
So I will put you

608
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,880
to Criminal Investigation Department

609
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,400
and get close to Feng Guangyun.

610
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
After all, Shiliupu Wharf

611
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
is under his control.

612
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,120
It'll be safer

613
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,160
for both you

614
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,120
and the Fourth Station.

615
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,880
I know.

616
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,840
Left right left.

617
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,720
One two three four.

618
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,720
One two three four.

619
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,200
Halt!

620
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,920
Left face!

621
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,800
Here's all the letters

622
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,600
he sent.

623
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,360
They're to the same people.

624
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
Burn it.

625
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,840
Mr. Hua

626
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,960
If I may,

627
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,720
please don't

628
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,560
make me do things

629
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,960
irrelated to training.

630
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,440
Thank you.

631
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,880
Come in.

632
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,240
Master Hu, you want to see me.

633
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,400
Brother.

634
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
What are you doing here?

635
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,960
To deliver daily necessities to you.

636
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,280
Brother,

637
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,240
did you take a leave and came from Nanjing

638
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,240
just to deliver me this stuff?

639
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,360
Mum asked me to visit you.

640
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,960
She got a plan for you

641
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,440
for your last vacation.

642
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,360
But you

643
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,440
went to Shanghai.

644
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,760
I've explained it to mother.

645
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,880
I know.

646
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,280
I'm not to blame you.

647
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,760
No need to see me off.

648
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,720
My car's just over there.

649
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,440
By the way,

650
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,960
I want to ask

651
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,440
do you still have contact

652
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,360
with those polices of the Fourth Station

653
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,520
after leaving Shanghai?

654
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,920
No.

655
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,320
Really don't?

656
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,400
Any phone calls?

657
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,480
No.

658
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,160
Brother,

659
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,040
why do you

660
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,960
ask?

661
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,400
A reporter named Peng

662
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,440
is missing.

663
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,160
He's one of my

664
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,480
friends' relative.

665
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,520
Now many people

666
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,160
are searching for him everywhere.

667
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,560
I heard that this case

668
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,240
was put on record

669
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,280
by the police station

670
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,040
you worked for.

671
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,200
So I help him ask you.

672
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,280
I'm sorry

673
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,360
I can't help.

674
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,840
Do you have their

675
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,000
contact information?

676
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I want to enquire more.

677
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,560
Brother,

678
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,680
you told me not to care

679
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,960
about what happened in Shanghai.

680
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,400
But you

681
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,680
are asking me now instead.

682
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,800
He is a good friend of mine,

683
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,400
otherwise I wouldn't give a hand.

684
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,200
I really don't

685
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,160
have any contact with Shanghai.

686
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,920
Got it.

687
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,080
Remember to study well

688
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,120
and discipline yourself.

689
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,280
Try the orange, quite sweet.

690
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,400
Don't just eat apples.

691
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,800
Hua Zhen, thanks for your oranges.

692
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,960
Take it.

693
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,520
Ermao, give me a break.

694
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,200
Hua Zhen brought us some fruits.

695
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,120
Quiet.

696
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,400
I ‘m almost done.

697
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,160
Class Three,

698
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,240
your letters arrive.

699
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,480
Help me out.

700
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,720
Let me see.

701
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,160
This's mine.

702
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,200
Sun Ze,

703
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,360
Got letters?

704
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,120
Is there any letter for me?

705
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,360
Here you are.

706
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,080
Hua Zhen, no letters for you.

707
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,320
Where did you send

708
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
all those letters?

709
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,400
Maybe the post route is blocked.

710
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,320
So they were not received.

711
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,920
Shanghai.

712
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,840
No way.

713
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,000
I sent a letter to my friend there before

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,080
and he received it.

715
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
You can call the post office

716
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,320
and ask about it.

717
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,400
Left right left.

718
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,360
One two three four.

719
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,920
Hello.

720
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,040
I want to make a long-distance call to Shanghai.

721
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,840
Hello, this is Shanghai.

722
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,120
Hello, please transfer the call

723
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,080
to the Fourth Station House

724
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,000
under Shiliupu Police Station

725
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

726
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,400
Hongfa.

727
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Erbai.

728
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,920
Let's go to the Shisi Lane and check residence registration.

729
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,280
OK.

730
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,760
Let's go.

731
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,840
Captain, we'll go now.

732
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,480
Household check doesn't need baton.

733
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,600
Captain,

734
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,840
there's a scuffle at the Donghua Lane.

735
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,640
I'm going there.

736
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,600
Be careful!

737
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:25,920
OK.

738
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,000
Wait for me.

739
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,240
I'm going to the Station.

740
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,800
Are you all going on duty?

741
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,480
Will you come back for lunch?

742
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,400
No.

743
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,520
Happy to be leisure.

744
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,000
Director, everyone has gone.

745
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,360
Do we need someone to stay here?

746
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,240
No.

747
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,800
You'll come back soon.

748
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,880
I'll address some private affairs.

749
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,360
Sorry sir,

750
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,160
the number you checked does not exist.

751
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,480
Doesn't exist?

752
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,560
Yes.

753
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,480
The owner of an invalid number

754
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,680
may have moved

755
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,200
or changed to a new number.

756
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
Could you please help me

757
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,880
check the new number of the Fourth Station House?

758
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Sorry

759
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,240
I don't find a new registered number.

760
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,880
But the telephone station was informed before

761
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,080
that many police stations

762
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,680
will log off their numbers

763
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,120
because of some system reform.

764
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,360
I heard instructor Hu said

765
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,520
last year our school

766
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:27,920
had ordered

767
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,240
torpedo boats

768
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,480
from Thornycroft, a British company.

769
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,360
Now eight of them have arrived.

770
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,200
The 55-inch-torpedo boat

771
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,680
is the latest model after WWI.

772
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,240
Yes.

773
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
Two petrol engines provide a cruising speed of

774
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,880
34 to 42 knots

775
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,560
with an endurance of

776
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
300 nautical miles.

777
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,000
Two Whitehead Torpedoes it got.

778
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,760
Its maximum speed reaches 41 knots,

779
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,680
and a firing range of

780
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,400
1000...

781
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,080
Hua Zhen,

782
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,760
is it 1400 or 1600?

783
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,920
What?

784
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,560
What's the maximum range

785
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,280
of Whitehead Torpedoes?

786
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,400
1400.

787
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,920
1400 meters at max.

788
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,400
Last year

789
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,760
you're the most excited one

790
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,240
after knowing we bought torpedo boats.

791
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,040
Do you

792
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,640
feel like you're going

793
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,720
to meet your girlfriend now?

794
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,280
Hua Zhen,

795
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:04,920
Yes, Sir.

796
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,880
In my office.

797
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,560
Yes, sir.

798
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,000
Coastal torpedo boats we ordered

799
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,440
have arrived

800
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,080
at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai.

801
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,920
They will be transported

802
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,160
to the campus after testing.

803
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,240
Now

804
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,000
the task to take over torpedo boats

805
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,560
is on your Class Three.

806
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,640
Your brother told me

807
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,080
what happened to you in Shanghai.

808
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,600
The assignment

809
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,160
is given by the Director.

810
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,400
But if you have any concerns,

811
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,400
you may request to opt out.

812
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,640
I can do it.

813
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,280
Nothing inconvenient?

814
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,640
No,

815
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,960
Sir.

816
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Then pack your luggage.

817
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,960
We'll set out tomorrow

818
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,560
and come back a week later.

819
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,640
Yes, sir.

820
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,240
Yuansheng.

821
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,440
Yuansheng.

822
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,200
Yuansheng.

823
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,200
It's me, Tian Dongbao.

824
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,280
Officer Tian.

825
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,040
Instructor Hu.

826
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,560
What's up?

827
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,360
Sir,

828
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,840
I encounter a friend of mine.

829
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,600
You have two minutes.

830
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Quick.

831
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,040
Yes, sir.

832
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,920
Let's go.

833
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,480
Officer Tian,

834
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,880
Why are you working at the dock?

835
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm not a police man anymore.

836
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,160
Just call me Dongbao.

837
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,960
Don't you know

838
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,200
the Fourth Station has been dismissed?

839
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,720
When did it occur?

840
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,400
Not long after you left.

841
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,840
We were dissolved

842
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,640
because of some municipal reform.

843
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,280
I got a job at the dock.

844
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,120
After all, I'm strong enough.

845
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,240
Dongbao,

846
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,720
hurry up!

847
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,920
I'm coming!

848
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,800
Yuansheng,

849
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,120
are you available

850
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,280
to have dinner at my home tonight?

851
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,640
I can gather up

852
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,400
officers of the Fourth Station.

853
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,120
And one more thing,

854
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm married.

855
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,240
You're married!

856
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,960
I live at

857
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,880
No.5, Anren Lane,

858
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,240
on the west side of Gaochang Temple Town.

859
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,520
Back to work, or I'll dock your pay.

860
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
One minute!

861
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,960
Don't forget to come.

862
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,120
No.5, Anren Lane,

863
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,520
on the west side of Gaochang Temple Town.

864
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,920
Hurry up!

865
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,200
OK.
