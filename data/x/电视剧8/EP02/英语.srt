Not sure.

8
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,560
They're making arrests.

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,720
Have they caught anyone?

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,400
Not a clue.

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,080
Can I leave it here with you for now?

12
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,200
I'll come back for it shortly.

13
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Sure, no problem.

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,400
Thanks.

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,160
I'm telling you,

these days

17

Hi, Captain Chen.

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
Captain Chen, you're back.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,160

What did you say?

24
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
I put your letter inside your room.

Captain,

34
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,760
they're from the household registration.

35
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,680
These are all invalidated,

36
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
yet to be canceled

37
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
at the Public Security Bureau.

38
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
These are empty households.

39
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,280
The owners have moved out of the area.

40
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
I'd like to borrow

41
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,080
this card for a week.

42
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,080
Then I will destroy it.

43
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
No matter what happens,

44
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,640
no one will use

45
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,120
this card again.

46
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,000
After a week,

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,480
you just need to go through the normal procedure

48
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,200
at the registration office to cancel it,

49
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
nothing else.

50
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,800
Understood.

51
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,360
Are you trying to ask me

52
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,200
when I'll end your dormant state?

53
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,240
When?

54
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,360
We need to wait a bit longer.

55
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
The central committee has sent

56
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,000
someone to Shanghai

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
for organization rebuilding.

58
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
But our force was

59
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
greatly weakened in the KMT controlled area.

60
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,960
Now, the most important thing

61
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,680
is to preserve our strength.

62
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
If it weren't for this

63
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,400
particular situation,

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I shouldn't have asked you

65
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,200
to help me with the documentation.

66
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,440
I understand.

67
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
I'll wait patiently.

68
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Can't find anywhere

69
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
to stay?

70
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,640
I don't know who to turn to.

71
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't you have any relatives in Shanghai?

72
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,880
What about your parents' friends?

73
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,760
I don't know them.

74
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,520
In fact, I had a French teacher.

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,320
However,

76
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
she left Shanghai

77
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,320
a few days ago

78
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,360
and I don't know

79
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,000
when she will return.

80
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,600
I can't go back

81
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,880
to my own home now,

82
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,400
can I?

83
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,760
The bedroom is yours. I'll take the couch.

84
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,800
Sir,

85
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
did you come to Shanghai

86
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,400
from somewhere else?

87
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,200
I've already bought a train ticket

88
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,240
back to Nanjing in three days.

89
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,040
Until then,

90
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,200
you can stay here.

91
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,240
I'll also

92
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,640
cover your meals.

93
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
Other than that,

94
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm not responsible for anything.

95
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,560
Deal?

96
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,440
Deal.

97
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
What grade are you in?

98
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,400
Second grade. I'm 8 years old.

99
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
If anyone asks,

100
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,840
we'll say

101
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
we're cousins.

102
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,760
Okay.

103
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,640
Any more questions?

104
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,320
What's your name?

105
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
I'm Hua Zhen.

106
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,120
What's the matter?

107
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Brother Hua Zhen,

108
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,120
how much do you

109
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
earn a month?

110
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,520
What?

111
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,560
Is it a lot?

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
40 silver dollars every month.

113
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,680
I'm not sure if that's a lot.

114
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,360
[Hua Zhen,]

115

[Does it matter a lot to you?]

117
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Extremely.

118
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,200
[It must remain a secret]

119
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
[from anyone else.]

120
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Liang, this is Zhen speaking.

121
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,080
I need your help

122
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
with something.

123
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm stepping out.

124
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,960
You should keep a low profile.

125
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,680
But I have

126
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,240
an important call to make.

127
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,560
I know you're looking

128
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,600
for a place to stay,

129
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,880
but it's best to keep out of sight

130
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,960
until the culprit is caught.

131
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,800
How about you come with me?

132
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,320
I've said before,

133
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
I only provide you with food and shelter,

134
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,000
not

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,080
anything else.

136
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,600
Excuse me,

137
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,160
may I use the phone,

138
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,840
please?

139
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,320
Why

140
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,240
are you alone?

141
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
Where are your parents?

142
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
Why aren't they with you?

143
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,480
They're in the room.

144
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
If

145
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,440
something happens to

146
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,360
a child like you

147
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,200
in our hotel,

148
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,560
we would be blamed.

149
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,840
Could you

150
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,320
write down your room number here?

151
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,200
In case of anything special,

152
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,360
I can contact your parents,

153
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,960
okay?

154
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,040
Just write it here.

155
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,920
Thanks, but...

156
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,280
my parents are upstairs,

157
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,440
I just need the phone

158
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,560
and I won't wander off.

159
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Alright then.

160
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,880
Thank you.

161
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,040
Duoci, this is all I have.

162
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
It's yours now.

163
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,760
Thank you, Yimo.

164
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,040
It's just...

165
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,520
could I possibly borrow

166
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,040
some money from you?

167
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
Not much.

168
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Here, Duoci.

169
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,760
I'll pay you back for this.

170
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,160
Where are your mom and dad?

171
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,680
Um...

172
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
is Luoyan home?

173
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,800
Bye.

174
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,920
Bye.

175
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,160
See you.

176
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,680
Is this Yubai speaking?

177
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh, okay, thank you.

178
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
I only have 6.2 Silver dollars,

179
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,560
here you are.

180
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,040
Thank you.

181
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,080
You're welcome.

182
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,440
Take care.

183
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,400
Bye.

184
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,000
Staying in your room all day?

185
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,920
There's nowhere to go.

186
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,080
Hello?

187
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,920
Brother,

188
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,680
how's the investigation

189
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,400
I asked you about?

190
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,880
I was about to tell you about that

191
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
even if you didn't call.

192
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,440
[Deng Mingyuan is in big trouble.]

193
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,840
[From now on,]

194
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,960
[you must distance yourself from him,]

195
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,760
[or you'll end up in trouble too.]

196
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,280
What kind of trouble?

197
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,280
He's been found out as a communist.

198
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,800
[The day he came to Dad's birthday party,]

199
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,440
he was taken away right after leaving.

200
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,400
The Party Affairs Investigation Bureau

201
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,040
has already visited Dad.

202
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,040
Everyone in our family

203
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,280
will be investigated.

204
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,000
Who took him away?

205
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,640
[Does that matter?]

206
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,160
I know you used to

207
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,920
say Deng Mingyuan

208
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
was your mentor,

209
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,080
[but you should stop]

210
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,680
[saying that now, Okay?]

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,560
He couldn't possibly be a communist.

212
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,040
He accompanied the former premier to the north,

213
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,400
and followed the Chairman on the Northern Expedition.

214
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,280
He has convictions and qualifications.

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,520
How could he

216
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,680
join the Communist Party?

217
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,920
Exactly, that's why it's foolish.

218
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,560
He threw away a promising future

219
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,080
to join

220
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,960
the Communist Party.

221
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,720
Brother,

222
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,160
if he is a communist,

223
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,000
what will they do to him?

224
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,160
[If he really is a communist,]

225
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,320
[he and everyone close to him]

226
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
[could be executed.]

227
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,560
By the way, I must ask you,

228
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,240
did you go to Shanghai

229
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,280
at your will

230
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,960
or did Deng Mingyuan

231
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,160
send you there for something?

232
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,760
[Why did you rush off to Shanghai]

233
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,000
[right after meeting him?]

234
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,320
I was just bored at home

235
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,280
and wanted to go out.

236
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,320
Oh,

237
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,840
I met a kid

238
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,800
in Shanghai.

239
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,160
Her family has undergone some changes.

240
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
[If I bring her back to Nanjing]

241
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,400
[when I report to the fleet,]

242
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,760
[could you guys help look after her?]

243
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,680
What kid could you possibly know?

244
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,720
Did Deng Mingyuan

245
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,800
ask you to find her?

246
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,920
[Hua Zhen,]

247
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,800
[I'm officially warning you now,]

248
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,160
Deng Mingyuan has accomplices in Shanghai too.

249
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,680
You must distance yourself not just from him,

250
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,120
but also from his associates

251
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,040
and their affairs!

252
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,160
[If you dare bring back someone]

253
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,120
[related to Deng Mingyuan,]

254
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,880
[our whole family could be involved!]

255
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960
It's just a kid

256
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,680
I happened to meet.

257
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,200
I was just asking.

258
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,680
Brother,

259
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,640
if he is a communist,

260
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,000
he must know he couldn't escape

261
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,040
when he stepped into the Hua's house.

262
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,720
Why would he still come?

263
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,160
Who knows what these communists are thinking?

264
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,080
Aren't you due to report back

265
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,640
to the fleet in a month?

266
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,760
You want to watch movies, visit fairs,

267
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,320
eat eight-treasure duck, sweet and sour fish,

268
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,200
go ahead.

269
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
[Immediately return to Nanjing once you've had enough fun,]

270
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,120
[and stop snooping around at night,]

271
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,920
[got it?]

272
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,360
Understood.

273
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
[Deng Mingyuan is in big trouble.]

274
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,560
[He's been found out as a communist.]

275
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,240
[From now on,]

276
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,360
[you must distance yourself from him,]

277
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,880
[or you'll end up in trouble too.]

278
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,320
Through a thousand books, one walks with the ancients.

279
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,400
[You must distance yourself not just from him,]

280
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,920
[but also from his associates]

281
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,200
[and their affairs!]

282
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,720
[If you dare bring back someone]

283
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,320
[related to Deng Mingyuan,]

284
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,960
[our whole family could be involved!]

285
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,160
[Sir, here's your receipt.]

286
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,400
Thank you.

287
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,400
I've handled the paperwork

288
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,280
and reserved enough for the room.

289
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,320
You can

290
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,960
stay here

291
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,680
as long as you like.

292
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,960
You can eat

293
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
all your meals at the hotel restaurant.

294
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
The chefs here are quite good.

295
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,480
I just read in the newspaper

296
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,400
that

297
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,680
the representatives from the city's labor and commerce unions

298
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,240
have petitioned the Public Security Bureau

299
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,560
to pursue the murderer vigorously

300
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,000
and maintain order in Shanghai.

301
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,480
So, you don't have to worry about

302
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,880
this case being ignored.

303
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
The demon

304
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,760
was wearing

305
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,320
a police uniform, though.

306
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,400
Will the police really handle it?

307
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,960
At least that's what the paper says.

308
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,400
After my parents and I

309
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,480
moved into the Wenhua Hotel,

310
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,560
they never opened the door for anyone.

311
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
They definitely wouldn't have opened it

312
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,160
if the killer hadn't been dressed

313
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
as a police officer.

314
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Apart from

315
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,640
the prominent business figures

316
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,920
as stated in the paper,

317
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,840
do your parents have

318
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,600
any other identities?

319
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,160
Any other identities?

320
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,400
My parents

321
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,360
own a large

322
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,760
herbal medicine factory.

323
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Other than that...

324
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,920
I don't know.

325
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Never mind.

326
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
The paper also mentioned

327
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,800
that it's likely you were also killed.

328
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,800
It's great, in some way.

329
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,920
At least

330
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,760
the killer won't know

331
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,840
your whereabouts.

332
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,240
After I leave,

333
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,280
you can go to the restaurant downstairs

334
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,120
for lunch.

335
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,560
Just take the keys and go.

336
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,520
You won't need to pay.

337
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,560
The keys are on the table.

338
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,320
Brother Hua Zhen,

339
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
if I give you some money,

340
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,800
could you stay in Shanghai

341
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
a little longer?

342
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,840
Hello?

343
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,840
Okay, I understand.

344
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,200
I'll come down right now.

345
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,120
My ride is here.

346
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,440
I...

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,280
This envelope

348
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,960
has 23 silver dollars in it,

349
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,600
borrowed from my classmates.

350
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,920
They're just kids too,

351
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,960
so they don't have much pocket money.

352
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,400
I've asked

353
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
all the classmates I could,

354
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,880
and only

355
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,240
borrowed 23 silver dollars.

356
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,720
This ruby necklace

357
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,080
was a birthday gift

358
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,520
I picked out myself when I went to a temple fair

359
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,040
with my parents

360
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
for the first time when I was six.

361
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,120
Can l hire you

362
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,520
to find

363
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,080
the killer

364
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,240
with them?

365
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,720
Weren't you out making

366
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,280
a phone call yesterday

367
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,480
to find a place to stay?

368
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,760
I already have a bed to sleep in.

369
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,280
Brother Hua Zhen,

370
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
you said

371
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,760
you earn 40 silver dollars per month.

372
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I don't know

373
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,400
how much this ruby necklace

374
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,760
can fetch,

375
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,840
but it's the best thing

376
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,240
I have right now.

377
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,440
Can I hire you for a month

378
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,640
with them?

379
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,120
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,520
This is...

381
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,600
glass,

382
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,120
not a gem.

383
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,800
Brother Hua Zhen!

384
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,880
This book, I don't understand it.

385
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
I'd like to give it to you.

386
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,040
Brother Hua Zhen,

387
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,600
thank you for saving me.

388
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,600
Hua Zhen!

389
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,600
Long time no see, An Yin.

390
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,520
Watch your tone.

391
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,240
I'm now the director

392
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,800
of the Assistant's Office

393
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,960
at the Shanghai Garrison Command,

394
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
Director An.

395
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,840
Just kidding.

396
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,640
Get in and we'll talk.

397
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,640
You called me yesterday

398
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,600
about that case.

399
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,760
I checked,

400
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,800
and it indeed was filed by the Fourth Station House

401
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,280
of the Shiliupu Police Station.

402
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,000
Did you know

403
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,680
the murdered couple?

404
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,360
No,

405
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,160
just someone

406
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,920
asked me to inquire.

407
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,880
This case is a bit unusual.

408
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
That couple were well-known

409
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,600
in Shanghai.

410
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,960
Usually,

411
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,000
a case this big

412
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,440
should go directly to the Public Security Bureau,

413
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,560
not just a police station.

414
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,680
I went to the bureau to ask about it,

415
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,560
and they were evasive.

416
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,600
I personally went,

417
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,560
and if it were

418
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,640
just a normal criminal case,

419
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,440
they wouldn't be secretive,

420
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,920
at least out of respect for our family.

421
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,680
So,

422
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,120
it might be something fishy.

423
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,640
You just mentioned

424
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,600
that the Shanghai couple

425
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,400
were well-known.

426
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,280
Do you know anything

427
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,160
about them specifically?

428
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,680
I'll spare you

429
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,640
their official titles.

430
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,520
This couple had no party affiliations

431
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,360
but were well-connected with government officials.

432
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,200
It might be because

433
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,120
of their business,

434
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,640
they were especially close with people

435
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,600
from the Navy Shipyard.

436
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,280
Why are you

437
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,960
so interested

438
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,040
in this case?

439
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,000
How about

440
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
let me give you a tip?

441
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,120
The Public Security Bureau is recruiting new police officers.

442
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,320
Just arrange someone

443
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,560
to apply for the position.

444
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,520
What's that saying,

445
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,680
all's fair in war?

446
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,920
If they won't tell us,

447
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,560
we'll infiltrate them.

448
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,640
Isn't that what you learned in

449
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,280
espionage and reconnaissance?

450
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,600
I'm joking.

451
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,680
Why so serious?

452
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,920
I know.

453
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Look at you.

454
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,760
Officer,

455
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,960
you mentioned the name Meng Duoci,

456
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,200
but there's no record of that name.

457
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,640
However, a girl

458
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,400
who looked a lot like her

459
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,560
did make a phone call here

460
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,440
a few days ago.

461
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,440
I saw she was alone

462
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,880
and took a bit more care with her.

463
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,120
I asked her

464
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,400
to write down her room number.

465
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,560
She wrote a five,

466
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,120
but then she erased it.

467
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,400
Alright, you can drop me off here.

468
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,880
Give your friend a word of advice:

469
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,640
don't get too curious.

470
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm afraid that the complexity of this case

471
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,600
lies not in the case itself,

472
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,600
but in what's hidden behind it.

473
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,320
Got it,

474
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,280
thanks.

475
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,120
Safe travels.

476
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,760
The train to Nanjing

477
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,600
is about to depart.

478
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,280
Dear passengers, please hurry up.

479
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,920
The train to Nanjing

480
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
is about to depart.

481
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,640
Please hurry up, passengers.

482
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,040
[Dear passengers,]

483
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,160
[The train will soon depart.]

484
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,480
[Please stow your luggage, and mind your safety.]

485
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,640
[Your attention please,]

486
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,720
[please stow your luggage.]

487
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,680
[The train is about to depart.]

488
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,800
[Dear passengers,]

489
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,760
[the train is about to depart.]

490
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,680
[Dear passengers,]

491
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,040
[please show your tickets]

492
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
[as the ticket checks will soon begin.]

493
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,200
[Duoci.]

494
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,520
[Duoci, it's me.]

495
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,840
Duoci?

496
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,000
Duoci?

497
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,320
Hello,

498
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,760
I was staying in room 530.

499
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,360
There was a girl with me.

500
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,520
Have you seen her leave the hotel?

501
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,440
She's about this tall,

502
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,520
wears a pink dress every day,

503
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,480
and has two braids.

504
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,560
Was her family name Meng?

505
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,440
How did you know?

506
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,680
An officer was just here

507
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,160
asking about

508
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,680
the same little girl you mentioned.

509
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,560
Was she taken away by him?

510
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,440
Sorry,

511
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,000
I didn't pay much attention.

512
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,480
Duoci!

513
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,280
Hello,

514
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,080
have you seen

515
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,000
a girl of about this height?

516
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,800
No.

517
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,760
Duoci!

518
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,040
[I definitely]

519
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,280
[made the bed this morning.]

520
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,840
[How did it get so messy?]

521
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,320
[You know what? The door]

522
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,480
[was open when I came earlier.]

523
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,960
[Don't know who would do such a thing.]

524
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,720
Meng Duoci.

525
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,080
Meng Duoci,

526
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,280
it's me.

527
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,720
That policeman came back again.

528
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,320
Are you hurt?

529
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,120
No,

530
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,240
I was hiding under the blankets the whole time.

531
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,080
I'm fine.

532
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,440
Okay, no more crying now.

533
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,240
Don't cry.

534
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,800
I wanted to follow him

535
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,080
to see what he looks like,

536
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,880
but

537
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,360
I was afraid he might notice me.

538
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,360
You did very well already.

539
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,160
I'm sorry,

540
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,160
I almost made a big mistake.

541
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,240
Where are we going?

542
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,840
To a different place to stay.

543
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,680
Will the killer

544
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,800
come back?

545
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,520
If he does,

546
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,400
I could ask the hotel staff for help.

547
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,920
They might help me.

548
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,480
But if I leave,

549
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,200
won't the killer lose track of me?

550
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,680
Whether or not

551
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,640
we can catch the killer,

552
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,280
I can't use you as bait.

553
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,480
What's wrong?

554
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,280
Are you staying to help me?

555
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,240
You're not leaving?

556
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Well...

557
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,640
I already missed the train.

558
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,400
Hello.

559
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,200
Can I help you, Sir?

560
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,280
Do you have any rooms available?

561
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,240
Yes,

562
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,680
we have a suite still available.

563
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,040
But our rents

564
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,480
are a bit high.

565
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Price is not a problem.

566
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,040
Sir, you've come

567
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,600
to the right place.

568
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,280
Of all the streets around,

569
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,880
our apartments are the best.

570
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,280
Not only is it quiet here,

571
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,320
but our residents are

572
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,200
all reputable ladies and gentlemen.

573
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,680
The rent for your room

574
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
is a bit high,

575
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,080
but it's the best.

576
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,160
It has everything you need,

577
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,520
including a telephone.

578
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,720
Please.

579
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,760
Feel free to take a look.

580
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,080
Do a lot of people

581
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,680
come and go from this apartment?

582
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,480
Are you worried about theft?

583
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,400
Rest assured,

584
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
everyone must register with me,

585
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,720
so no thieves can slip in.

586
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,680
Okay,

587
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,280
I'll take the room.

588
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,200
Please sign in here.

589
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,400
Here are the keys.

590
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,200
Let me know

591
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,280
if you need anything.

592
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,280
Sure,

593
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,640
thank you.

594
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,520
The reason I came to Shanghai

595
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,520
was to deliver a book for someone.

596
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,680
It wasn't until

597
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,040
I saw the ship tickets and identity papers inside the book

598
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,840
that I realized

599
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,400
I wasn't just delivering a book,

600
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,840
[but a chance for your family]

601
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,800
[to survive.]

602
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,080
Is he a very important friend to you?

603
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,640
More important than a friend.

604
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,760
To me,

605
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,920
he's like

606
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,680
the morning star.

607
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,200
Now that I've decided to stay,

608
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,120
there are two things you need to know.

609
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,880
First,

610
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,800
for some reasons,

611
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,160
I can't take you back to Nanjing,

612
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
nor can I send you to an orphanage

613
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
or foster care,

614
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,760
as it might

615
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,960
bring them trouble.

616
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,680
So, for now,

617
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,800
you'll have to stay with me.

618
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,200
Okay.

619
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,000
Second,

620
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,200
to others, we will

621
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,240
call each other cousins.

622
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,120
No problem.

623
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,120
But I don't know how to take care of a child.

624
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,080
I'm not really a child.

625
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,640
Alright... Okay.

626
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,760
Actually, I still

627
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,000
have some doubts.

628
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,880
Maybe catching the killer

629
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,800
will provide some answers.

630
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,400
But after a month,

631
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,040
whether we catch the killer or not,

632
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,280
I must return to Nanjing.

633
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,000
Here's your new identification.

634
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,520
For now,

635
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,600
your name is Li Qiushi.

636
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,040
And you?

637
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
[Xiang Yuansheng.]

638
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,240
Brother Zhen,

639
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,720
where are you going

640
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,360
with this identity?
