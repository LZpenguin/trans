00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,400
[Luo Minmin,]

174
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,920
[Stop flattering yourself]

175
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
[A hair clip can't make you more attractive.]

176
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm showing off

177
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,600
because I look pretty.

178
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,920
But you don't.

179
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,360
So you have nothing to flatter about.

180
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm so blessed

181
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
to join the police force.

182
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,760
Luo Qinqin,

183
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,320
the hair clip on my hair

184
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,080
makes me look more gorgeous.

185
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Do you want to admire that?

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,160
I will not.

187
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,040
What a narcissist!

188
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm not.

189
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,080
Come back here.

190
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,400
Button up the collar.

191
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,960
Then

192
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,960
my charisma is hard to hide.

193
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,600
Luo Minmin.

194
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320
I thought you had given up

195
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,640
after two-year consecutive exam failures.

196
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,520
I didn't expect

197
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,040
you should pass the exam this year.

198
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,080
Brother, the enrollment

199
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
is limited to 98 persons.

200
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
She ranks the last on the admission list.

201
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,640
Not a single point

202
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,840
more.

203
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,320
It is useless to get more scores.

204
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,480
After all, I'm in a police uniform now.

205
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,360
When you were born,

206
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,280
if God had a scale,

207
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,080
he must have put more weights

208
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,160
on your luck

209
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,960
than your wisdom.

210
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,400
I'd love to accept it.

211
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,880
What can you do about it?

212
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm a lucky girl.

213
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
God always likes me.

214
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,280
That is not true.

215
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,840
You are dumb

216
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
and couldn't pass any exams.

217
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
You didn't learn anything.

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,400
So stop fancying yourself.

219
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
Hell, it is true.

220
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
You are good at anything,

221
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
except sports.

222
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
That's enough.

223
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
If blessed by God,

224
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,200
she shouldn't pass the exam.

225
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
In case a war broke out,

226
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,200
you would be drawn to the front line.

227
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,960
Dad.

228
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,480
I serve in a station house.

229
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,200
I won't have a chance to fight a war.

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,760
We are running

231
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,400
such a big shop.

232
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,640
Somebody must take responsibility for it.

233
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
Look,

234
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,520
I'm the backbone of our family.

235
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,960
Dad,

236
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,520
my brother can help you.

237
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,600
I'd thank god if he handled himself well.

238
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
If you decide to serve in the police force,

239
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,960
I have a request.

240
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
When confronting with something dangerous,

241
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,600
you mustn't be the first one to charge ahead.

242
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,480
Stay away from any harm if you can.

243
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,120
If you can't,

244
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
just run.

245
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Do you get what I said?

246
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,480
Promise me.

247
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,800
Dad.

248
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Don't worry about me.

249
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
I will protect myself.

250
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,520
[Are we in the right place?]

251
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,920
[No one is here except us.]

252
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,920
[Just wait here.]

253
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,360
[The officer is not coming yet.]

254
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,160
This is my business card.

255
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,640
Nice to meet you.

256
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
Nice to meet you.

257
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,560
Nice to meet you.

258
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,920
Take it, please.

259
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,920
I'm Sun Hongfa.

260
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,440
The Hongfa Restaurant,

261
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,280
just as my name implies,

262
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,760
is run by my family.

263
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,160
From now on,

264
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,280
all of you

265
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,400
and I are colleagues,

266
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,160
which means we are friends

267
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,520
and brothers

268
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,040
and sisters.

269
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,760
If you come to my restaurant for dinner,

270
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
just mention my name

271
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,480
to its manager.

272
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,960
You will be given a discount.

273
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,120
Officer Sun,

274
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
is your family

275
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,000
very rich?

276
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,720
Not so much.

277
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,880
My family and I

278
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,120
merely want for nothing

279
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
That's all.

280
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,880
God damn it.

281
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,400
This abduction case

282
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,720
can be broken.

283
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,480
As soon as the superior assigned the case,

284
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,600
our inspector took it over.

285
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,320
He's never even thought about us.

286
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,200
The inspector did take over the case.

287
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,680
But the captain put the most time

288
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,440
and effort into the case.

289
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,880
He didn't complain about it.

290
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,960
Why are you feeling aggrieved?

291
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,360
It's not what I mean.

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,080
We all know

293
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
the captain should be credited

294
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,320
for the investigation of the case.

295
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,080
Unexpectedly,

296
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
the inspector pushed himself forward.

297
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
In my opinion,

298
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,360
the captain is a little bit silly.

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,960
Shut up.

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,680
I know the captain treats us well.

301
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,720
If he was not here,

302
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,240
I would have left the station house

303
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,000
years ago.

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,840
But I have to feed my family.

305
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,720
Right?

306
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,960
Take the checking of household registration,

307
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
we couldn't

308
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
accept nothing from householders.

309
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
It would never happen

310
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,960
in any other station houses.

311
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,800
If he insists on doing this,

312
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,640
I'll quit.

313
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,400
Get out of here if you want to give it up.

314
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm not targeting you.

315
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,680
What the hell are you yelling at?

316
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,320
I knew clearly

317
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,680
what you thought.

318
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,440
You attempted to

319
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,840
let your brother wear the police uniform.

320
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,000
But he was kicked out

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,160
by these raw recruits.

322
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,720
I feel embarrassed for you.

323
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,960
Don't you dare to say it again?

324
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
Shame on you!

325
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Shut up!

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
[Stop fighting. We are colleagues.]

327
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,000
Let go!

328
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,280
Li.

329
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
Don't fight.

330
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Stop it.

331
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,440
That's enough.

332
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,240
Li.

333
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,840
Li, stop it.

334
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,920
Let go.

335
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Damn you.

336
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,600
Li, stop it.

337
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,160
Bai.

338
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,720
Move away.

339
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,440
Bai.

340
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm done

341
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,120
and I quit.

342
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,000
So do I, Bai.

343
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,360
Tell the captain I'm sorry.

344
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,080
Wait for me, Li.

345
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,560
You have made yourself stand out.

346
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm feeling so happy

347
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
for you.

348
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I won't go there.

349
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
My aspiration is to serve as a policeman.

350
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,560
Nonsense.

351
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,080
Mr. Jin

352
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,360
is a tycoon.

353
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,800
He is a rich man.

354
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,840
If you do the personal bodyguard for him,

355
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,120
your salary a month would be

356
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,360
worth that of half a year in a station house.

357
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,680
You helped him to break a case.

358
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
That's why you're offered such a good job.

359
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,560
Cherish this opportunity.

360
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,200
They offer me a job.

361
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Why do you go with me?

362
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
You know why.

363
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,600
You always

364
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,360
pull a long face

365
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
and have no talking skills.

366
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,960
Just stand there

367
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,120
like a statue.

368
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,440
You need my help there.

369
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,080
No.

370
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
Today is the day for new recruits.

371
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,440
As an inspector, you should greet them.

372
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Just a bunch of inferior students.

373
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Let them wait there.

374
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
Think about it.

375
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,960
Out of a total of 98 cadets admitted,

376
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
we got those at the bottom of the list, again.

377
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
If only we could get

378
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,520
those of top 90.

379
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,280
I heard

380
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,080
one of them didn't even get through

381
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,240
the admission line but still was admitted.

382
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,480
Guess what,

383
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
maybe this back-door student has

384
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
some true skills and genuine knowledge.

385
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
I was told that

386
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,600
he got full scores

387
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,080
in two subject exams

388
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,360
but missed the last one in the end.

389
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
Otherwise,

390
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,200
he would get through the admission line.

391
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
The streetcar is coming.

392
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm not going.

393
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,080
You have to.

394
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,440
Easy, easy.

395
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,640
Let's go.

396
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,240
Zuo.

397
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
Get in.

398
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,480
"Carp jumps over the dragon gate"

399
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,680
If he is like what you said,

400
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,000
he didn't need somebody to back-door him.

401
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,840
I reckon his scores are fake.

402
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,720
What's his name?

403
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,200
I don't care his name.

404
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
Listen up.

405
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,200
Now we are on the way

406
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
to a French high-class restaurant.

407
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,320
Take care of your appearance and behavior.

408
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,840
If you were appreciated someday,

409
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
that would be my honor.

410
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,360
Got it.

411
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,840
Look at the girl by that door.

412
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,600
She is really pretty.

413
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,200
Which one?

414
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,880
The one in the front.

415
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,200
Well...

416
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,080
You are 29 years old.

417
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,360
You are not a child.

418
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,800
Excuse me.

419
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,600
I want to put up a missing person notice.

420
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,560
Come over.

421
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,560
What do you want to post?

422
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,200
Here.

423
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,880
You want to find your teacher?

424
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,560
[I wish all bridges]

425
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,960
[and all tunnels your pass be firm and bright.]

426
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,240
From whom?

427
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,840
No name.

428
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,720
You don't leave a name on it.

429
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,200
How should he know you are after him?

430
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,960
He will.

431
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,480
Thank you.

432
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,600
Chen Hao.

433
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,320
Chen Hao.

434
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,840
Where are you?

435
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,240
Come out.

436
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Stop it.

437
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,840
He didn't come back.

438
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,240
What's wrong with you?

439
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,800
You are looking upset.

440
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,560
Li and Shitou quitted.

441
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,840
What can I say?

442
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,080
They would quit anyway.

443
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,360
We need fresh blood.

444
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,600
You got married in this suit?

445
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,560
Line up.

446
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,120
Attention!

447
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
Let me introduce

448
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,320
this man standing in front of you.

449
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,040
He is the police inspector

450
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,360
of the Fourth Station House

451
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
of the Shiliupu Police Station

452
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
of the Police Department.

453
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,480
Zuo Ronghua.

454
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,960
You may clap.

455
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,360
At ease.

456
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,320
We can be like a family.

457
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,480
From now on,

458
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,000
just call me Zuo.

459
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,080
The station house has a bad reputation.

460
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,720
But I don't think so.

461
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I can feel its warmth.

462
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,120
Just like a big family.

463
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
Hence,

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
I hope everyone of you

465
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,960
will make the station house

466
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,120
your another big family.

467
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,000
I think

468
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,080
it's better to introduce yourself first.

469
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,560
Talk about why you want to be a policeman.

470
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,440
Who will be the first?

471
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:20,960
I will.

472
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,720
I will.

473
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,120
OK.

474
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,360
Sir,

475
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,800
my name is Sun Hongfa.

476
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,320
My father is the owner

477
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,800
of the Hongfa Restaurant.

478
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,200
My uncle

479
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,120
and Chief Wang of the Fifth Baojia District

480
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,000
are sworn brothers.

481
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,240
This is my family's business card.

482
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,600
Here you are.

483
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,280
Good.

484
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
My family wanted me

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,120
to serve in government.

486
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
But I persisted in serving in the police force.

487
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,840
Because it is my dream

488
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
to become a policeman.

489
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,120
Great!

490
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,560
My name is Tian Dongbao.

491
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,440
I did chicken raising in the countryside.

492
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
But my father didn't want me to do that.

493
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,480
He told me a policeman would be paid more

494
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
than a chicken breeder.

495
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,440
Good.

496
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,760
You can breed some chickens

497
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
in our station house

498
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
to improve our food diversity.

499
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,240
And...

500
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,800
Yes, sir.

501
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,040
So the pretty girl.

502
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
Why do you serve in the police force?

503
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Sir,

504
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,160
I want to do the cause

505
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
because I want to protect my family.

506
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,320
That sounds interesting.

507
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,520
You are Luo...

508
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
Luo Minmin.

509
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,040
Oh, yes.

510
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,840
I know you.

511
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,720
You are the last one

512
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,640
on the admission list.

513
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,040
Don't feel embarrassed.

514
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,560
Their scores

515
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,800
are almost the same as yours.

516
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,520
It is so wonderful

517
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,320
to have a policewoman here.

518
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,280
You don't need to do field operations

519
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,920
because that is a waste of your talent.

520
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,440
When guests or superiors

521
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,040
visit the station house,

522
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,600
you are responsible for

523
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
greeting

524
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,040
and serving them.

525
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,360
So that's it.

526
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,520
This young man

527
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,800
has a good figure

528
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
and appearance.

529
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,840
Pretty good.

530
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,360
What's it for to join the police force?

531
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,240
the Chairman said

532
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,040
police force must be the base of a country.

533
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
A policeman must uphold justice

534
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,280
and protect people.

535
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,760
[That bad man is a policeman.]

536
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,360
[He wears a police cap and a uniform.]

537
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,880
Why do you take an English book with you?

538
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
That tall man

539
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,040
is the guy in place of Bai's brother

540
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,640
through a back-door dealing.

541
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
Let me introduce this man.

542
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
This is the captain of our station house.

543
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,000
Chen Hao.

544
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,360
He will be in charge of

545
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,440
your specific duties.

546
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,920
Say something.

547
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,840
I need to get changed.

548
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,640
We met before.

549
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,400
Do you remember?

550
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,840
Yes.

551
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,920
What is your name?

552
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,520
Xiang Yuansheng.

553
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
X-i-a-n-g Xiang?

554
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
Y-u-a-n Yuan

555
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,920
and s-h-e-n-g sheng.

556
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm your captain.

557
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
My name is Chen Hao.

558
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,520
You are going to

559
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,680
do a one-month-long internship.

560
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,880
You will be divided into two groups.

561
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,760
Two men in each group.

562
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,520
If you pass the exam,

563
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,800
you will become a regular policeman.

564
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,320
Otherwise, you will be fired.

565
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
Understand?

566
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,120
Yes, sir.

567
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,920
Now choose your partner.

568
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,440
Captain.

569
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,840
I want him with me in a group.

570
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,160
OK, approved.

571
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,040
Sir.

572
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,320
I have a request.

573
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,120
Speak.

574
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,520
I want to go on field operations with them.

575
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,360
Do you agree?

576
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,600
Why did you say that?

577
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,840
The inspector asked me

578
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,760
to greet and serve guests

579
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,840
and superiors.

580
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,640
No policewoman ever worked here

581
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
before.

582
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,520
So it was awkward

583
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,760
to arrest female criminals.

584
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,240
You are the first one coming here.

585
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,840
It will be such a waste

586
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,400
not letting you catch female criminals.

587
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Thank you, captain.

588
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,320
Bai,

589
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,560
show them around.

590
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,000
OK.

591
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,040
Follow me.

592
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,440
Come on.

593
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
Let me show you around.

594
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,600
[Although it is a small station,]

595
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,880
[it has a long history.]

596
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,440
[This way.]

597
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,440
What happened to Xiang Yuansheng?

598
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,160
He is a missing person.

599
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,840
He remains missing

600
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,120
for more than three years.

601
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,040
He has no immediate relatives in Shanghai.

602
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,880
The landlord of the house he rented

603
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,600
is his only inheritor.

604
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,320
The court had approved

605
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,240
the landlord's filing,

606
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,800
which means that man is dead.

607
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,000
So his household register card

608
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,880
and information in the

609
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,000
RRS of Public Security Bureau

610
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
need to be written off.

611
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,400
I need this household register card

612
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,840
for a week.

613
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,160
Then I will get rid of it.

614
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,600
No matter what happens,

615
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,440
nobody will use it

616
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
again.

617
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,680
That room we visited just now

618
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,640
is a resting room.

619
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,280
You can get changed there.

620
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,520
Let me distribute your working areas.

621
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
Chicken feeder

622
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,360
Restaurant boy.

623
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,120
Here.

624
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,680
Yes, sir.

625
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,440
The tailender.

626
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,840
There.

627
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,760
Yes, sir.

628
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,800
You don't have to do this.

629
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,080
Yes, sir.

630
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,920
What are you doing?

631
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,120
I haven't given you a desk yet.

632
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,160
The Chairman said

633
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,600
the police force is the base of a country.

634
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,360
Did he call you

635
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,880
last night?

636
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,120
According to you, the status

637
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,880
of the police is very important.

638
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,680
But why are we paid

639
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,600
so little?

640
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,520
Could you call

641
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,000
the Chairman

642
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,040
to increase salaries for us?

643
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Some senior officers of the Police system

644
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,040
once provided a reform suggestion

645
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,160
to turn the Police Department

646
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,040
into the Police Office.

647
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
But it has been laid aside

648
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
for some political reasons.

649
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,800
Turning the department into the office

650
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,600
means improving the status

651
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,080
and welfare of the police,

652
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,160
Then your salary status will be improved.

653
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,760
Cut the crap

654
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,680
Don't tell me

655
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,400
this nonsense.

656
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,560
For some political reasons?

657
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,440
Do you even know politics?

658
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,200
OK.

659
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,520
Let me tell you what the politics is.

660
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,280
If I can't get the salary for June,

661
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,560
don't expect me to investigate cases

662
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,840
of July.

663
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
This is the politics.

664
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,320
Do you understand?

665
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,120
Pour a mug of water for me.

666
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,600
Here...

667
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,280
I'm talking to you.

668
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Do you hear me?

669
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,320
Bai

670
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,000
What are you doing?

671
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,560
Officer Xiang will be on alarm duty today.

672
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,840
What?

673
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,760
Captain,

674
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,120
Green hands never did that before

675
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,240
here.

676
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
It's to test their capabilities.

677
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,400
Luo Minmin.

678
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,880
Yes, sir.

679
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,800
You go with him.

680
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,400
You are partners.

681
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,240
Help each other.

682
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,600
Yes, sir.

683
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,040
Officer Luo.

684
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,360
What day is it today?

685
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,880
Let me check it out

686
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,400
from the newspaper.

687
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,600
Officer Luo.

688
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,560
Do you get it?

689
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,080
Yes.

690
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,840
See that.

691
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
Two geese fought

692
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,600
and blocked the road.

693
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,480
Officer Xiang.

694
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Did you ask me to do something

695
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
just now?

696
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,320
It's done.

697
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,840
Thank you.

698
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,840
Don't be shy.

699
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,760
What is it?

700
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,800
The two geese...

701
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,160
Where are you going?

702
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,280
Will you come back for dinner?

703
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,840
No.

704
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,040
Captain Chen.

705
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,600
I have checked the register book.

706
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,440
I didn't get the name of Xiang Yuansheng.

707
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,040
I'm certain

708
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,840
he never checked into our hotel.

709
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,280
Can you recall this man?

710
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
No.

711
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,000
Are you sure?

712
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,560
Yes.

713
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,040
Stop, the man in a suit.

714
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,040
Do you live here?

715
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,280
No.

716
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,320
I'm here to visit a friend.

717
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,080
Which room is your friend in?

718
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,280
Who was in these rooms

719
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,680
on that day?

720
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,320
They were all vacant

721
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,600
that day.

722
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,000
As Mr. Meng checked in,

723
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,160
he told us not to disturb him.

724
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,640
So we kept those rooms

725
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,600
vacant.

726
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,080
Thank you.

727
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,840
It's hot.

728
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,040
Sir.

729
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,640
As I'm on a mission,

730
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,840
will I get

731
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,640
a code name?

732
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,360
Just like yours

733
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,000
which is 037.

734
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,440
Of course,

735
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,920
your will.

736
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,080
You are a good cop, Chen Hao.

737
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,080
Being a police officer is not only

738
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
a camouflage

739
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,160
but also your dream.

740
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,840
I know

741
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,640
you are a man with an ideal.

742
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,800
Have the noodles.

743
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,600
OK.

744
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,320
Take your time.

745
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,760
It is the record book of receiving alarms.

746
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,840
Note down those

747
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
you recorded on it

748
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,160
before off-duty.

749
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,880
Make clear notes about

750
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,600
who called the police,

751
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,800
what kind of case,

752
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
and receiver and responder.

753
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,680
May I ask

754
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,560
if the record in recent days

755
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,440
is on it?

756
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,920
Captain Chen.

757
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,800
Captain Chen.

758
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,120
Let me go.

759
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,600
You are a scum.

760
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,520
Captain Chen will put you

761
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
under arrest.

762
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,880
Let go of me.

763
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,840
Get in.

764
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,240
Wait.

765
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
You filthy bastard.

766
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,360
I'm not.

767
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,000
Captain Chen is not here.

768
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,560
You may tell me what happened to you.

769
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,240
You are just a girl.

770
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,680
You can't deal with it.

771
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,120
Wait...

772
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,360
Officer.

773
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,640
Officer.

774
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,360
Punish him.

775
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm innocent.

776
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,480
He peeped at me while I was bathing.

777
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,400
[No. 031 is a girl abduction case.]

778
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,040
[No. 032 is a homicide case.]

779
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,520
[Both happened in the Wenhua Hotel.]

780
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,360
[They both happened in the same place.]

781
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,080
[The responder was Chen Hao for both cases.]

782
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,800
I can't deal with it. She can.

783
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,280
Officer.

784
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,840
Officer.

785
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,160
Don't go.

786
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,120
Wait, Officer Xiang.

787
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,280
I can't handle it by myself.

788
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm the victim.

789
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,240
You bastard.

790
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,080
Don't do it.

791
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Don't hit me.

792
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Stop.

793
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Stop it.

794
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,240
Stop it.

795
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,280
Stop it.

796
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,840
Stop it.

797
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,560
[No. 032:]

798
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,120
[The homicide in Wenhua Hotel.]

799
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,320
[Three dead.]

800
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,280
[They died of throat cut.]

801
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,560
[Meng Duoci disappeared.]

802
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,400
[No. 031: Girl abduction.]

803
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,040
[Scene: Wenhua Hotel.]

804
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,440
Sorry.

805
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,000
Sorry.

806
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,440
He is the suspect.

807
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,240
So he was on the crime scene

808
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,680
that day.

809
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,600
Why are you in the archives room?

810
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm a freshman.

811
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,240
I'm here to read documents and

812
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,760
learn the rules and regulations

813
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,640
of Police service.

814
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Report to me before stepping in the archive.

815
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,280
It's not a good idea to go in here without permission.

816
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
If my memory is good,

817
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,640
in Wenhua Hotel,

818
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,840
you told me you came here for a journey.

819
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,920
Yes.

820
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,720
You came to Shanghai for the first time?

821
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Had been before.

822
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,120
But your ID card shows

823
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,400
you are a native.

824
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
A native came here for a journey?

825
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,440
I lived with my family in another place.

826
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,160
What is the place?

827
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,400
Nanjing.

828
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,920
Really?

829
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
It is a good city.

830
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,480
Since you came here for a journey,

831
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,920
why are you serving in the police

832
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,320
now?

833
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,360
I heard

834
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,320
the policemen here were paid well.

835
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,160
So I want to check it out.

836
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,760
You got ability

837
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,280
more than trying your luck here.

838
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,200
You got full scores in two subject exams.

839
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,360
If you were not absent from the last exam,

840
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,000
your score would get you

841
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,520
into the Police Department.

842
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,640
Why did you miss the exam?

843
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,240
I overslept.

844
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,840
I missed that exam.

845
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,680
What a pity.

846
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
What did you do before?

847
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,640
You checked my ID card.

848
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,320
My information is written on it.

849
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,480
Fisherman.

850
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,400
Look at these hand cocoons.

851
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,480
You did a lot of labor.

852
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,000
They were rubbed by ropes.

853
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,320
You knew about the place.

854
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,480
If you got powerful connections,

855
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,840
I advise you

856
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,440
to select

857
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,680
a better place.

858
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,640
This place

859
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,120
is good enough for me.

860
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,520
Great.

861
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,240
This is your ID card.

862
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,440
It's not yours, right?

863
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,680
What are you talking about?

864
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,640
Does it have any problem?

865
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
No.

866
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,520
Xiang Yuansheng.

867
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
It is a good name.

868
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,640
Thank you.

869
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
I need to go back to my duty.

870
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,640
I told you already.

871
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,280
You bitch.

872
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,360
Don't hit her.

873
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,880
You set me up.

874
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,320
This is the police station.

875
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,280
You set me up.

876
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,240
You bitch.

877
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,120
Let her go.

878
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,320
Do you want to try again?

879
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,440
This bitch framed me.

880
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
I won't.

881
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,840
Get out of here.

882
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,680
OK.

883
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Thank you, officer.

884
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,800
Next time,

885
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,280
don't use violence.

886
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,120
So...

887
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,120
What is the office's name?

888
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,640
Officer Xiang.

889
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,800
Goodbye, Officer Xiang.

890
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:18,920
Zuo.

891
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,640
Who is behind him?

892
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,520
Do you mean Xiang Yuansheng?

893
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,120
You didn't know anything.

894
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,200
I asked.

895
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
But it looked weird.

896
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,440
Nobody told me.

897
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
But you have reminded me.

898
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,640
I often heard rustlings

899
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,800
in the yard.

900
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,640
Is there a rat in the house?

901
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,640
Can you get a cat?

902
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Get one for me.

903
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,560
Cats always come after rats.

904
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,880
What do you mean?

905
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,120
Just keep him.

906
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,640
Let's observe what he attempts to do.

907
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,000
What?

908
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,560
Rats are rats.

909
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,240
They feed on birds.

910
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,720
Why are you laughing?

911
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,760
Have some more.

912
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,840
You have a big appetite.

913
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,360
Here.

914
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,120
Thank you.

915
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,720
Thank you.

916
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,000
Have more.

917
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,840
You don't have to thank me.

918
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,760
It's quite normal

919
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,960
on your first day.

920
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,360
Actually,

921
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
I want to ask you a question.

922
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,320
Did I look embarrassed

923
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,160
just now?

924
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,360
What?

925
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,480
I know

926
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,240
I damaged the image of the police force.

927
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,480
I was at the bottom

928
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,800
of the admission list,

929
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,960
narrowly made it.

930
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,320
If someone was weeded out,

931
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,480
it would be me.

932
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,640
But I'm determined to

933
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,840
stay here.

934
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,120
Therefore,

935
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,480
from now on,

936
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,360
I wish

937
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,680
we could help each other.

938
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,720
So

939
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,120
allow me to introduce myself

940
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,960
to you.

941
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,280
My name is Luo Minmin.

942
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:34,920
If you get in trouble

943
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,960
in future,

944
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,040
I can help you.

945
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,280
I heard

946
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,040
you are the one getting the job through back-door dealings,

947
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,560
right?

948
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,840
Yes.

949
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,200
You surely

950
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,360
understand my feeling,

951
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:48,880
right?

952
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,920
So let's call it a deal.

953
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,800
Thank you for helping me out.

954
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,880
We are partners,

955
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,400
right?

956
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,880
If possible,

957
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,320
I advise you

958
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,480
to change a partner as soon as possible!

959
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,120
I don't get it.

960
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,160
What a strange man!
