Shooting Stars EP14

3
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,160
Dad, Minmin is right.

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,440
They are her friends...

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,800
You call those friends?

6
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,800
And you,

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,120
making friends with Japanese?

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,800
I... I don't know any.

9
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,560
Don't lie to me.

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,880
I... I really... I really don't know.

11
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Someone was

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,320
asking for Meng Duoci or something.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,520
Dad,

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
how do you know about Meng Duoci?

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,720
I don't know any Meng Duoci.

16
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
Someone came earlier,

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,440
first asking for your brother,

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,560
then you,

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,400
claiming to know Meng Duoci or something,

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,160
sounded like a Japanese to me.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,200
Yuansheng,

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
what's going on?

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,680
Li Qiushi is Meng Duoci.

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,280
She's the daughter of the couple

25
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,760
who were victimized at the Van Hwa Hotel.

26
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,920
Besides me

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,240
and Chen Hao,

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,240
only the killer knows it.

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,080
Hongfa,

30
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,520
the killer

31
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,480
attacked Miss Luo

32
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,880
and is still looking for her.

33
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,360
What does he want?

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,320
Who cares what he wants.

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,840
We'll guard the Luo's home tonight.

36
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,120
Even if he turned into a fly,

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,960
we would not let him in.

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
Can you tell me

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,240
what exactly happened?

40
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,400
Nothing.

41
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,600
What's with

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,480
all these people?

43
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,840
Are you planning to stay the night?

44
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,920
No, that won't happen.

45
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,560
They'll leave soon.

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,960
You just relax and rest.

47
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,360
Sister,

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,800
you said before,

49
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,520
officers from the Fourth House took good care of you.

50
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,040
I thought

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,800
you were just comforting Dad and brother.

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
But now,

53
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,120
some keep a lookout in front,

54
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,520
others guard at the back door.

55
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,960
They really

56
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,120
are protecting us.

57
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,640
They do

58
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
care about you.

59
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,800
Alright,

60
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
get some sleep.

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,400
I'm not hungry, thank you.

62
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm not hungry either.

63
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,320
But I've heard

64
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,680
that when you're tired,

65
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
eating something can perk you up.

66
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,120
Thanks.

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,120
Is your brother doing well

68
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,440
with his work outside?

69
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,680
He's doing fine.

70
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,560
He works as

71
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,840
a typesetter in a printing factory.

72
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,640
On Sundays,

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,200
he helps out in a bookstore.

74
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,920
All the jobs were obtained

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,080
through the Captain's connections.

76
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,640
Apologize to him for me.

77
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,160
If it weren't for me cutting in line,

78
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
he should have been a policeman

79
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
at the Fourth House by now.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,440
Actually...

81
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,160
my brother doesn't want to be a policeman.

82
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,280
He's not like me.

83
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
He enjoys reading

84
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,360
and took to streets, protesting and chanting

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,160
slogans alongside college students.

86
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,520
I don't really understand

87
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,080
these young people's stuff.

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,760
But I've come to realize,

89
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
everyone has their own life to live.

90
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,840
Let them do what they want.

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,520
You're doing a great job

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,600
as a police officer.

93
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,240
Captain!

94
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Erbai!

95
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,480
Did you find the place?

96
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Yes, I did. The emblem is a school crest,

97
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,240
run by the Japanese in Hongkou District.

98
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,920
Let's discuss

99
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
the details back at the station.

100
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,720
What are you doing here?

101
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,760
A Japanese man

102
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,680
came by yesterday.

103
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
We thought he might be the killer,

104
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,240
so we kept watch here overnight.

105
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Alright, let's head back.

106
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,040
You two keep watch here.

107
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,480
Okay, let's go.

108
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,640
Let's move.

109
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,160
What... what did you find out?

110
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
You nearly lost your life,

111
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
and you still want to be a police officer?

112
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,240
I just don't understand

113
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,720
why you're so keen

114
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,240
on going back to the police?

115
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
Initially,

116
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,400
I wanted to become a police officer

117
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
to chase away those

118
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
who troubled my brother.

119
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,240
I thought that by wearing the uniform,

120
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400
I would be a cop.

121
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,360
I just wanted to protect

122
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,600
those I could.

123
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
But later, I realized

124
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,600
I was far from being a real cop.

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
And I thought,

126
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,920
like everything else

127
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,480
I've done since my childhood,

128
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,720
even though I became a police officer,

129
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,880
I would

130
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,560
be the worst

131
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
one again.

132
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,240
Yet,

133
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,240
surprisingly, someone say I'm pretty good at it,

134
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,080
and he says

135
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,840
it's not about ability.

136
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,080
So you've made up your mind?

137
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I stayed up

138
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
last night, thinking.

139
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,640
I think

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,920
it's not about whether or not

141
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm a cop,

142
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
but about

143
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,960
what kind of person I want to become.

144
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,600
Maybe

145
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,320
I'd never be a heroic,

146
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,120
justice-serving officer

147
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
like the Captain,

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,640
and maybe one day,

149
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,080
I won't even be a cop.

150
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
But,

151
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
at least I should be

152
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,960
someone useful.

153
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,720
Dad,

154
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,720
for the first time in my life

155
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,360
when I worked at the Fourth House,

156
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,000
I felt I could become a person like that.

157
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,840
I don't know

158
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,120
if it's an illusion,

159
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,520
but I feel like the officers

160
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,960
kind of like me,

161
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,840
and I like them, too.

162
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,400
This is the first time

163
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,320
I've heard you speak so earnestly

164
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,640
about one thing.

165
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,720
So, Dad,

166
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,480
have you agreed with me?

167
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,520
In my heart,

168
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
I would never agree

169
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,480
to let you go back.

170
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,400
It is ridiculous indeed.

171
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,640
Can't your station

172
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,400
recruit any other female officers?

173
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,720
A bunch of people at my doorstep day and night for you.

174
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,600
Even if they worried about your safety,

175
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,880
they should know you are protected by

176
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,240
your brother and I.

177
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,400
They don't even go home and

178
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
just guard you.

179
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,120
Dad.

180
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm being very serious

181
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,360
with you right now.

182
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,080
I know, very, very serious.

183
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,480
Finally.

184
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,400
Why so late?

185
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
Someone called in this morning.

186
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,760
The mahjong parlor owner

187
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,880
was found hanged.

188
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,520
What's the name of the mahjong parlor?

10189
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,360
He Yi.

190
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,280
That place is not far from Miss Luo's home.

191
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,760
And

192
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
A clerk from Dongguang pawnshop

193
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,720
was shot dead.

194
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
Looks like we've got our work cut out!

195
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,080
Weren't you suspended?

196
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,400
Who allowed him to come?

197
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,320
Chief,

198
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,080
there's something important

199
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,600
I need to report.

200
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,480
You! Get out!

201
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,120
Here's the thing,

202
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,880
now, the situation is...

203
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,480
Why am I being kicked out?

204
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,640
What's going on?

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You'll regret this!

206
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
I found it out

207
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,960
in the clothing factory's order book

208
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,560
that the uniform

209
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
is for the Japanese Youth

210
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Industrial School.

211
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,200
This means our target

212
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,160
is likely

213
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,120
a student there.

214
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,320
He has an accomplice

215
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,960
named Hideo Yoshida.

216
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,720
I suspect they're using false identities

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,800
to disguise themselves,

218
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
possibly having other aliases.

219
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
The two homicide cases

220
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,880
Ronghua just mentioned

221
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
may be connected to the two suspects.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,480
I called and found out

223
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,280
the school

224
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
only holds classes

225
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,360
from 2 PM

226
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,040
to 7 PM.

227
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,640
Today, however, the school is closed for a holiday.

228
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,480
Classes will resume tomorrow.

229
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
Let's make our move tomorrow then.

230
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,240
The school is located in Hongkou District,

231
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,360
near the Suzhou Creek,

232
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,080
surrounded by a large Japanese expatriate area,

233
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
which is at our disadvantage.

234
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,360
We need to lure the target

235
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,120
into a smaller side street

236
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,000
to take action.

237
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
It's still early morning,

238
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,240
and you were up all night.

239
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,920
Go get some sleep for now.

240
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,080
Captain!

241
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,000
Captain!

242
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,520
Look who's here.

243
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,120
Mr. Luo.

244
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,480
You watched over

245
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
my house last night.

246
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,120
Now that Minmin

247
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,400
is coming back,

248
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,640
I'm worried you might be hungry

249
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,840
and wouldn't be able to look after her well.

250
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,480
Tianxiang, Qinqin.

251
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,000
Here's some breakfast I prepared for you.

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,080
Everyone, eat up!

253
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,800
My Dad

254
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,240
made six portions,

255
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,840
all are my favorite food.

256
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,480
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

257
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,400
Thanks, Mr. Luo.

258
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,040
Aren't you suspended?

259
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,320
Oh,

260
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
and you,

261
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,600
didn't you quit?

262
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,600
Yuansheng is staying.

263
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,520
That's right.

264
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
Yuansheng is staying,

265
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,240
and Miss Luo is back.

266
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,880
No one is absent.

267
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,720
Here's your uniform.

268
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,880
I wasn't going to give it to you,

269
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,120
but I know

270
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,760
I can't lock you up...

271
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,120
not that it means I agree...

272
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,640
Not that it means you agree I should be a cop.

273
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
So,

274
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
I'll remember more than ever

275
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,240
to take care of myself.

276
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Thank you, dad.

277
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,400
Be home on time every night.

278
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,120
I will.

279
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,600
She will.

280
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,240
It's okay.

281
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
Eat while it's hot.

282
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,240
Get home early.

283
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,520
Mr. Luo, take care.

284
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,720
Captain,

285
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,720
Officer Luo Minmin requests to return to duty!

286
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,080
Welcome back!

287
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,120
Yeah!

288
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,240
Hurry, come eat!

289
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
Come on, eat up.

290
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,080
Try it.

291
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,880
Make sure to have some dough sticks.

292
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,520
I can

293
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,880
eat two every morning!

294
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,680
And let me introduce

295
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,040
these sugar pastries.

296
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,560
The sesame on top is very fragrant,

297
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,200
and the sugar inside is crunchy.

298
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
It smells so good!

299
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,960
I could smell it

300
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,040
on my way here!

301
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,360
This tastes so good!

302
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,120
What else?

303
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,600
Try this pastry.

304
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,480
It's so good.

305
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,400
Save some for Ronghua.

306
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,200
Sure thing.

307
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,080
Don't just serve.

308
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,960
Eat some yourself.

309
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,480
Eat up.

310
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,480
Slow down.

311
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,400
Don't get choked.

312
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,600
You should try mine.

313
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,440
So good!

314
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,880
I... I don't want yours.

315
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,440
Tell you what,

316
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,920
when I was little,

317
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,600
I couldn't

318
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,120
eat anyone else's cook.

319
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,800
My Dad's cooking is the best.

320
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,600
How about you come over to eat

321
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,160
at my place sometime?

322
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,400
Sure.

323
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,160
Come on, Yuansheng.

324
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,160
Ronghua!

325
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,760
Ronghua!

326
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,840
I'm not the Chief.

327
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,960
You are.

328
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,040
You're the boss here.

329
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,880
It's you.

330
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,240
I've got good news.

331
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,480
Minmin is back.

332
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
She and her Dad brought breakfast,

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,400
and I got a portion for you.

334
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,880
Is she okay?

335
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
She's fine.

336
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,120
Are you still upset?

337
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,880
She's fine, but what about you?

338
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,120
You've been suspended.

339
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,560
What are you still doing here?

340
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,480
Whatever I say, you won't listen.

341
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,480
Why not reconsider

342
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,320
that bodyguard job with Mr. Jin?

343
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,960
I think it's a

344
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,000
good gig, right?

345
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,560
What are you doing?

346
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,320
You startled me.

347
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,800
Wishing you a safe journey.

348
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
May your bridges be strong

349
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,520
and tunnels be bright.

350
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,400
Having not

351
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,480
seen my old friend for days,

352
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,360
Here's a poem to express my thoughts.

353
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,680
If it suits you,

354
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,280
let us meet at the usual time and place

355
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,040
on the 26th this month.

356
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,560
Come on, chase me!

357
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,640
Wait for me!

358
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,880
Hurry up.

359
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
Do you like poetry?

360
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,040
I've read Taranci's "Train."

361
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,640
Do you know

362
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,720
what it says

363
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,840
on the locomotive?

364
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,280
May your bridges be strong

365
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,120
and tunnels be bright.

366
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,000
That's the code phrase

367
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
Mr. Deng and I used.

368
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,640
I used to wait here with an umbrella

369
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,800
at this time for him.

370
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,840
But I never expected

371
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,320
it would be you today.

372
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,920
After the leader was arrested,

373
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,280
the CPC assigned

374
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,000
me to

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,160
re-activate you.

376
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,760
From now on,

377
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,160
I'll be your superior,

378
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,720
taking over from Leader Deng,

379
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
and I'll be your direct contact.

380
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Is Deng okay?

381
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,400
He's detained

382
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,760
at the Shanghai Garrison Command.

383
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,240
He communicated

384
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,760
the code phrase to me.

385
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,680
Besides re-activating you,

386
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,680
there's another thing today.

387
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,560
This photo was taken by a journalist

388
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,000
from the national salvation organization.

389
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,840
On the right, you know him well,

390
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,720
the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Tan Shiyuan.

391
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,520
The man on the left holding a wine glass

392
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,720
is unidentified,

393
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,960
and the one in the middle is Nakamura Naoki.

394
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,320
He runs a charitable hall

395
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,760
in Shanghai called Hongji Benevolent Society

396
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,760
and

397
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
has been awarded a good citizen

398
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,160
for abiding by the law.

399
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,800
Tan Shiyuan even

400
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,080
presented him with a medal,

401
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,760
which was reported in newspapers.

402
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,200
I remember that news.

403
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,240
The police are often dispatched

404
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,120
to maintain order in front of

405
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,520
the Hongji Benevolent Society.

406
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
Feng Guangyun dispatches all.

407
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,480
The national salvation organization found

408
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,720
that ronin frequents the site,

409
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,600
suspecting

410
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,760
espionage activities.

411
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,840
The organization

412
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,440
asked for help in investigating

413
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,680
Nakamura Naoki's identity.

414
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,480
And,

415
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,520
we found that

416
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
this Japanese

417
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
was formerly a part of the Kwantung Army's

418
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,680
fourth section,

419
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,880
responsible for military propaganda.

420
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,840
He managed

421
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,440
the propaganda efforts

422
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,840
at Harbin Daguanyuan.

423
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,800
Nakamura also

424
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,640
represented

425
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
the South Manchuria Railway office in Nanjing,

426
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,840
selling railway equipment

427
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
to the Nanjing government,

428
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
gaining deep trust from the Japanese military.

429
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,800
Are you saying

430
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,640
Tan Shiyuan is colluding with the Japanese military

431
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,520
through Nakamura Naoki?

432
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,000
Exactly.

433
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,560
This relates to the Meng family homicide.

434
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,640
I know you and Xiang Yuansheng

435
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,600
have been investigating it.

436
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,640
Just today, we made a progress.

437
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,760
We suspect the killer

438
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,000
is a student from the Japanese Youth

439
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,040
Industrial School.

440
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,920
We plan to stake out

441
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,280
their school gate tomorrow afternoon.

442
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,320
If the suspect is indeed from there,

443
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,960
we will catch him tomorrow.

444
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,520
I've always suspected

445
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,000
that Mr. Meng and Mrs. Meng's murder

446
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,320
was connected to the Japanese military.

447
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000
But now with Tan Shiyuan's collusion

448
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
with the Japanese,

449
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,320
if you hand over the murderer to police authority,

450
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,000
Tan will eventually

451
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,320
let them escape punishment.

452
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,840
That's why

453
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,280
I need you to hand the person over to me.

454
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,760
That's also why

455
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,160
I needed to see you today.

456
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,240
Another thing,

457
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,440
the leader refused

458
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,640
our rescue plan

459
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,000
because he didn't want

460
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,560
more comrades to risk their lives for him.

461
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,440
Soon,

462
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,520
he'll be transferred

463
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,920
to the Central Military Prison in Nanjing.

464
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,920
What then?

465
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,600
Activating you was the last request

466
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,920
the leader made to the CPC.

467
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,120
He didn't have anything to give you,

468
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,480
but he gave you

469
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,320
his code name.

470
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,400
From now on,

471
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
you are 037.

472
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Leader,

473
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
I have one more question.

474
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,120
When I'm officially activated,

475
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,080
will I also have a code name,

476
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
like your 037?

477
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,320
Of course.

478
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,120
You will.

479
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,160
You are a good policeman,

480
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,120
Chen Hao.

481
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,800
Being a policeman

482
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,360
isn't just your disguise.

483
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,920
It's also your dream.

484
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,680
I know

485
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
you are a person with dreams.

486
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,640
I once asked Mr. Deng

487
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,080
if I would get

488
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
a new code name

489
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,160
when I was activated.

490
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
Now I have one,

491
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,000
but I never thought it would be this one.

492
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,960
If anyone

493
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,280
could see Mr. Deng again,

494
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,360
please tell him

495
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,320
that I will complete my mission.

496
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,800
Let's hope the operation goes smoothly.

497
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Thank you, Yuansheng.

498
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,640
Come on,

499
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,000
go test my battleship.

500
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,320
Let's go.

501
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,480
Sorry, Captain Chen.

502
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Sorry for the trouble.

503
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,160
It's nothing.

504
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,640
Let's go.

505
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,320
He cries every time he visits.

506
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,200
You really like ships, huh?

507
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,360
I do.

508
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,400
I even thought

509
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,640
maybe one day

510
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,960
I could be a warship captain.

511
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,800
But I never imagined

512
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
that one day I'd be sitting here,

513
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,800
folding paper boats for kids.

514
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,120
You've changed after joining

515
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,040
the Fourth House.

516
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,960
Haven't you changed, too?

517
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
Me?

518
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,360
Fixing that broken lock today

519
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,960
after so long?

520
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,640
I used to live an unshaped life.

521
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,400
Today marks a fresh start.

522
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,960
Plus,

523
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,920
you're moving in, right?

524
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,720
I thought I should tidy up the place.

525
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,920
If we manage

526
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,320
to catch the killer today,

527
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,880
this case will be closed,

528
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,040
and I should head back to Nanjing.

529
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,200
But before I go,

530
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,840
I need to see

531
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
that person sentenced,

532
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,160
to fulfill the promise I made to Qiushi

533
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,840
and the person

534
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,920
who sent me to Shanghai.

535
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,040
Pleasure working with you.

536
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,120
Hope it all goes well.

537
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,040
Shine your shoes, sir?

538
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,560
Yes.

539
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,400
Have a seat.

540
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,240
Make them nice and clean.

541
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,240
You got it.

542
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Hand me that newspaper.

543
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,160
It's okay,

544
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,880
no need to be nervous.

545
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,640
Takagi.

546
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,040
Right now?

547
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,120
We are one step away.

548
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,640
Did you not tell Mr. Nakamura?

549
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,480
We need to get Meng Duoci's whereabouts

550
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,280
from that policewoman!

551
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,520
Are you ordering me?

552
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,240
Return to

553
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,800
the Marine Corps headquarters

554
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,720
right now.

555
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,560
Takagi!

556
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,560
Hello?

557
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,360
Mr. Nakamura,

558
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,640
Takagi Tamaki has acted on his own.

559
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,360
He's planning to approach

560
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,240
that policewoman again.

561
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,520
Stop him immediately.

562
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,280
If the police traced it to the diner,

563
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,080
they might track it back to the school.

564
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,960
Tell him to cease all operations

565
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
and return

566
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,440
to the Marine Corps headquarters now.

567
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,160
Is that him?

568
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,800
Yes.

569
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,040
Captain,

570
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,160
should we make a move?

571
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,480
Not in the Japanese quarter.

572
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,840
Hold off for now. Follow him.

573
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,160
What's wrong?

574
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,160
Captain.

575
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,640
This is our first time here.

576
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,120
We can't just barge in.

577
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,280
Right,

578
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,840
the killer

579
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,760
could be lurking

580
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
anywhere here.

581
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,320
Cowards!

582
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,960
He was

583
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,120
all over Luo Minmin before,

584
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,440
now he's scared.

585
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,040
He probably saw our numbers

586
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
and got scared off.

587
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,520
Captain,

588
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,560
should we ask the theater staff

589
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,360
to turn on the lights?

590
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
Turning on the lights might scare him away.

591
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,200
So, what do we do?

592
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,320
I can lure him out.

593
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,840
What are you thinking?

594
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,640
He's looking for me.

595
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,680
If I walk out alone,

596
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,360
I can draw him out.

597
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,600
That's too risky.

598
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,840
He doesn't know where Qiushi is yet.

599
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,760
He likely won't kill me right away.

600
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,160
He knows the school

601
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,240
has been compromised.

602
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,080
If he misses this chance,

603
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
he won't get another.

604
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,440
Captain,

605
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,080
I can do this.

606
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,080
Minmin,

607
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,680
you enter through the side hall.

608
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,760
Yuansheng, follow her.

609
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,560
You two, cover the door.

610
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,400
Erbai, you take that side.

611
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:46,880
Understood.

612
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,200
Be careful.

613
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I'm on your back.
