3
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Brother.

4
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,760
Dad.

5
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,440
Xiang Yuansheng,

6
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,320
remember what you said

7
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,400
at my house that day?

8
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
You said you were done being a cop.

9
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,440
Why did you

10
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,760
drag my daughter into this?

11
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,320
You were acting together,

12
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,400
weren't you?

13
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,240
And there were so many of you.

14
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
But why?

15
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,760
Why was my daughter

16
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
assaulted alone?

17
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,160
Tell me why.

18
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,040
Can you talk?

19
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
Say something!

20
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,800
A bunch of useless people.

21
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Feng Sir.

22
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,520
The station

23
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
received a notification from the police hospital

24
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
about an injured officer.

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,120
That's right.

26
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680
I must come and check on the situation.

27
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,080
Yes, Sir.

28
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
She hasn't woken up yet.

29
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,680
Not awake?

30
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Then go wake her up.

31
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
The doctor said her injuries are severe.

32
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,560
Does sympathy solve cases?

33
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,960
Answering a few questions

34
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,120
won't delay her recovery.

35
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,240
She hurt badly.

36
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,280
Can't you treat her as a human being?

37
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,120
If too delicate, she shouldn't be a cop!

38
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,640
Thank you!

39
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,800
You're right!

40
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
Absolutely right!

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,240
Tianxiang,

42
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
get a stretcher

43
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,080
and transfer her to civilian hospital.

44
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's move her to another hospital.

45
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,080
Officer Luo,

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,120
Officer Luo.

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,960
What do you want?

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,840
Let's talk this out.

49
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,640
Calm down.

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,080
Stay away from her.

51
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,400
Are you out of your mind?

52
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,480
Who do you think you are?

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,640
I said, stay away from her.

54
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
Officer Xiang,

55
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,960
I'm convinced that

56
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,080
you're really not suited

57
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,640
to be a policeman

58
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,080
with your disregard for others and disciplines.

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,480
My career

60
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,520
isn't up to you to decide.

61
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,520
Move!

62
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,840
Move aside!

63
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
Let me find you a car.

64
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,960
The finest officers from the Fourth Station House

65
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
are all here, huh?

66
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Tell me,

67
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,200
who was involved

68
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
in last night's incident?

69
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,120
Feng Sir, they were all involved...

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
Did I ask you?

71
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
1556.

72
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,800
A new officer?

73
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,120
What's your name?

74
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,240
Tian Dongbao.

75
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,600
You speak.

76
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,360
Last night...

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Last night, the station house responded

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,360
to a burglary call.

79
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,680
Probationary Officer Luo Minmin was assaulted.

80
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
So Captain Chen

81
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,360
was responsible for the case.

82
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,360
Then tell me,

83
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,600
who was it? Did you catch them?

84
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
We didn't see the perpetrator.

85
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,840
Identity unknown.

86
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,360
Interesting.

87
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,800
You didn't see who did it.

88
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
So how did

89
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,040
the probationary officer get hurt?

90
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,360
At that time...

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Shut up!

92
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,840
You speak.

93
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,000
Last night, the Captain

94
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,920
had me searching for clues.

95
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,240
I wasn't at the scene.

96
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,280
You.

97
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
We split up.

98
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,160
I don't know how.

99
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
You at the scene, Officer Xiang.

100
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,720
Your turn.

101
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,720
I've resigned already.

102
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
You can't question me.

103
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,960
So none of you

104
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,840
knows anything?

105
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,200
You should know

106
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,160
the bureau's rules!

107
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,120
Probationary officers

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,840
are not allowed to participate in dangerous activities!

109
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,920
Captain Chen,

110
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,160
I'd like to know how,

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
right after I warned you

112
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,000
yesterday afternoon,

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
you allowed a probationary officer

114
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,840
to break the rules

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,280
and get seriously injured?

116
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,040
It was my misjudgment.

117
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,520
I thought

118
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,360
it was a routine burglary,

119
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
so I allowed her to respond.

120
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
How did you receive the call?

121
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
Someone called in.

122
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,040
Who answered?

123
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,480
I did.

124
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Who made the call?

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,400
Not sure.

126
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Do you realize what you're saying?

127
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Think twice before you speak.

128
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
All she said

129
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,040
was Wangyun Road No. 23.

130
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,280
The line had too much static.

131
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
I could only tell it was a woman.

132
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,040
When we got there

133
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
at Wangyun Apartments,

134
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,280
we didn't see the caller.

135
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
Someone called the police

136
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,920
and hid herself from the police?

137
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,960
Maybe too scared

138
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,840
to show up.

139
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,040
So, the Fourth Station House,

140
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,520
busy all night,

141
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,920
full force deployed,

142
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
and all you achieved besides

143
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,040
getting a probationary officer hurt

144
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,360
was nothing?

145
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,520
Feng Sir,

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,160
it's... it's all my fault.

147
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,360
After all, our station house

148
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,920
hasn't handled such a big case before...

149
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
Incompetents! Are you senile?

150
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,720
Don't move!

151
00:09:59,480 --> 00:09:59,840
Nobody move!

152
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,160
What are you doing?

153
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,960
Everybody freeze!

154
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
Hands off!

155
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,400
Take Chen away!

156
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,520
-Back off!
-Back off!

157
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,360
[If you can't manage your subordinates,]

158
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,040
[you better get out of here!]

159
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,560
[We will investigate this thoroughly,]

160
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
[to the bottom of it.]

161
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,240
As a Captain, your negligence

162
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,600
led to an officer badly injured.

163
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,320
I have no choice but to suspend you.

164
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,080
Well done.

165
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,960
Captain.

166
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,640
Let's go.

167
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,040
My face!

168
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
You've all

169
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,760
disgraced me!

170
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,120
What a good girl she is!

171
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,080
And now look at her!

172
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,760
Did any of you even think?

173
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
She's not just an officer,

174
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,640
she's a young woman!

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,760
Of course,

176
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,200
she's young, impulsive.

177
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
What about the rest of you?

178
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,360
What about the older ones?

179
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
[The one in this room!]

180
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,840
[What are you all good for?]

181
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,960
I can't even be mad at you anymore!

182
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,480
Might as well

183
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
take this opportunity

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
to disband the Fourth Station House.

185
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,720
Better off disbanded.

186
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,080
Out of sight, out of mind.

187
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,240
Everyone, dismiss.

188
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,960
All of you, get out!

189
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,720
That's it.

190
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,240
Go back now.

191
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,720
Dongbao,

192
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,600
Go.

193
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,240
Hongfa, go back.

194
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,840
Yuansheng,

195
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,360
that button

196
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,880
Minmin was clutching yesterday...

197
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,480
She was so badly injured,

198
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,200
yet she still

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,440
held onto that button.

200
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
I... I went through

201
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,720
every trash can

202
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,840
at the scene yesterday.

203
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,280
I...

204
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,560
I couldn't find any clues.

205
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Sorry.

206
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,320
I'm useless.

207
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,920
I'm sorry!

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,720
I'm sorry!

209
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,840
I'm so sorry, I'm useless!

210
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,200
Hongfa,

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,840
go and get some rest.

212
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,640
Now, Hongfa.

213
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,080
Since you joined the Station House,

214
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,960
we haven't had a single

215
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,840
peaceful day!

216
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,120
Minmin got injured,

217
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
the inspector was slapped,

218
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,200
and now the Captain has been suspended.

219
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,600
All this trouble,

220
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,360
arise from the Mengs case.

221
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,760
Xiang Yuansheng,

222
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
I don't even want to know

223
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,960
who you really are anymore.

224
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
Since you've already handed in your resignation,

225
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,840
just leave us quickly.

226
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Only if you gone

227
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,400
can the Fourth Station House

228
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,080
get back to how it used to be.

229
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,080
Don't take Erbai's words to heart.

230
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,040
Your resignation is accepted.

231
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,200
Now go and check on Luo Minmin.

232
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,840
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,240
My police badge has been taken.

234
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
My uniform and cap are here.

235
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,040
You'll be compensated

236
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,120
for this month.

237
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,120
Are your parents still in Fengxian District?

238
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,600
Yes Sir.

239
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,560
They're doing alright?

240
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Quite alright.

241
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,720
Go visit them.

242
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
As for what's next,

243
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,920
just take it one step at a time.

244
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,120
Say something.

245
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
The job isn't done yet.

246
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,120
Stubborn, you're so stubborn!

247
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,360
When you dig your heels in,

248
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,040
not even eight horses can pull you back.

249
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,360
Can you just listen to me for once?

250
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,600
How old are you?

251
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,400
Almost thirty.

252
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,080
Can't you just live

253
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,400
like a normal person?

254
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,560
Find a girlfriend,

255
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,040
hold hands,

256
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,760
watch a movie.

257
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,480
Wouldn't that be far better than

258
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,560
what you're now?

259
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,400
Sounds good.

260
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,160
But my man almost died.

261
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,000
I asked her

262
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
to stay under that streetlamp.

263
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,320
She was lying there, covered in blood.

264
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
I wish it had been me.

265
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,880
Captain Chen,

266
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,120
I've come to take back my resignation.

267
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,080
Zhang Runjin?

268
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,840
In Shanghai?

269
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
You know him?

270
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, I do.

271
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,440
I once destroyed

272
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
an Undercover Work Group of CPC

273
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,800
in Guangzhou,

274
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,080
and he was their liaison man.

275
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,560
He got away from me.

276
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,920
I never thought he'd show up in Shanghai.

277
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,480
Did he say anything before he passed out?

278
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
He said

279
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,440
he went to Wangyun Apartments

280
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,520
to meet a friend

281
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,040
and got injured

282
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,480
while helping chase a burglar.

283
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,040
He wouldn't say anything else.

284
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,040
But when I got him,

285
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,320
he was making a phone call,

286
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,680
looking very anxious.

287
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,880
I traced the location.

288
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,960
It was from a public phone.

289
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
We got this from the telephone company.

290
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,760
He made two calls.

291
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,600
The first seemed to go unanswered,

292
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,160
and he only started talking during the second one.

293
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
But he was too far away

294
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,680
to hear what he was saying.

295
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,160
If he was caught up

296
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,440
near Meng Duoci,

297
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,200
he's definitely a member

298
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,560
of Deng Mingyuan's group.

299
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,720
The person he was calling

300
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,200
must be his accomplice.

301
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,160
It rang more than four times?

302
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
That's not Mr. Zhang.

303
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,120
[Qiushi,]

304
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,560
[are you doing okay at Ms. Shi's place?]

305
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,600
[I'm fine. How about Minmin?]

306
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,920
[Did you find her?]

307
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,120
We found her.

308
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,680
Is she alright?

309
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,800
Is she hurt?

310
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,920
[She just got home from the hospital.]

311
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,800
Qiushi,

312
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
I'm calling to

313
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,560
ask you one thing.

314
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,640
[Who sent the cake]

315
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,760
[on the table?]

316
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,200
[Uncle Luo delivered it in person.]

317
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,080
Did Officer Luo's father

318
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,840
visited you?

319
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,840
Did he tell you

320
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
how he knew this address?

321
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,160
No.

322
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,600
[I got it.]

323
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,760
Take care of yourself.

324
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,800
Mr. Luo,

325
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,160
sorry to bother you.

326
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,240
I must confirm something

327
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,160
with you.

328
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
You are not a police officer.

329
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
Officer Xiang,

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
what happened to you?

331
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,080
Have some warm water.

332
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,440
Wipe it yourself.

333
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,360
Who let him in?

334
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,600
I heard someone was knocking on the door.

335
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,040
Dad, Xiang is a good person.

336
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,160
Check the decoction.

337
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
What do you want?

338
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
on the day Officer Luo was assaulted,

339
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,240
you visited the apartment

340
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,600
and brought a cake to Qiushi.

341
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,280
I need to know

342
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,960
how you knew

343
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,880
that address?

344
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,240
Had you ever told the address

345
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,400
to anyone else?

346
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
What do you mean?

347
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,760
You are suspecting one of us

348
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,840
had collided the suspect.

349
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,280
Told him the address

350
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,120
And asked him to hurt my daughter?

351
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,880
Are you out of your mind?

352
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,760
Sister.

353
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,840
It's me.

354
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,440
My hand slipped.

355
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,600
I'll clean it now.

356
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,000
Be careful.

357
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,840
I'll fetch the broom.

358
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,200
You get out of my house.

359
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
Qinqin, stay where you are.

360
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,800
Don't get hurt.

361
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,320
Mr. Luo.

362
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,800
Thank you for

363
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,320
arranging a rickshaw

364
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,560
to send us back home.

365
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,360
I have some questions

366
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,760
to ask that driver of the rickshaw.

367
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,400
Could you please

368
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,560
take me there?

369
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,920
I'm busy today.

370
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,120
I'll clean it

371
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
and cook a diner for Minmin later.

372
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,560
I'm sorry.

373
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,440
Officer Xiang.

374
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,200
Did my brother make any trouble?

375
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,360
No, it's just a casual talk.

376
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
Could you please

377
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,640
don't mention what had happened

378
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,400
on that day

379
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,360
to my sister?

380
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,840
She finally woke up

381
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,360
this morning.

382
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,120
She was freaked out that day.

383
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
Well.

384
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,800
I'd better not bother her.

385
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,560
You're here to visit her today,

386
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,760
aren't you?

387
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,920
The Fourth Station House is investigating

388
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,360
the case she got involved in.

389
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,560
And I'm here to make inquiries.

390
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,600
Sorry to bother.

391
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Officer Xiang,

392
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,360
I had a button

393
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,200
in my hand.

394
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,600
Did anyone see it?

395
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,920
It's with me.

396
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,760
I tore the button out

397
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,760
from the clothes

398
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,840
of the suspect.

399
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,760
Will it be a clue?

400
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,360
I heard that you're investigating.

401
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,080
Will it help you?

402
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,360
Don't worry.

403
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,000
It's an important clue.

404
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,600
It'll lead us to the criminal.

405
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,920
Liu.

406
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,400
Have you seen

407
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,600
who put the eggs on my doorstep?

408
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,600
No, I haven't.

409
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,920
Who put the eggs here?

410
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,120
Whose eggs?

411
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,440
Dad, it must be the policeman

412
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,320
from the Fourth Station House.

413
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
They sent the eggs to my sister.

414
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,880
I would rather some hens

415
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,200
laid them by mistake.

416
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,160
Don't touch it.

417
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,640
Luo, if you don’t want them,

418
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
I'll have them.

419
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,360
What are you doing?

420
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,920
Your dad agreed

421
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,360
to give it to me.

422
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,080
You misjudged his courtesy.

423
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,920
They are gifts to us.

424
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,360
Greedy.

425
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,160
What a family it is.

426
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,440
You stole the eggs?

427
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,600
I bought it.

428
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I never steal things.

429
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,200
Why didn't you tell them?

430
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,120
I don't know how to face her family.

431
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,080
How's Minmin.

432
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,760
She's better.

433
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,360
Good.

434
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,120
I wonder

435
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,920
If there is anyone else

436
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,040
knows the address of Wangyun Road

437
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,800
except you, Li Qiushi

438
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,320
and the family of Luo?

439
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,680
Wait and see.

440
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,520
We'll get the answer soon.

441
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,920
Brother, Dad wants you to...

442
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,560
Something wrong?

443
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm fine.

444
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,000
What was it?

445
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,960
Dad wants you to

446
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,680
buy more medicine for sister.

447
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,120
I'll go now.

448
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,840
I'll go now.

449
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,680
I've paid my debt.

450
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,440
What do you want more?

451
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,320
I heard from the boss that

452
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,280
you would get 30 silver dollars reward

453
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,640
after he got the bounty.

454
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,560
Is it true?

455
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,200
I did it

456
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,080
just for paying back the money.

457
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,520
I won't ask more than I should get.

458
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,680
I won't take that money.

459
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,440
Tianxiang,

460
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
we heard your sister officer

461
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,000
was beaten badly.

462
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,600
Well, we three should

463
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,120
take care of our sister then.

464
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,080
No.

465
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,360
My sister has nothing to do with this.

466
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,440
I beg you.

467
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,680
Do what I told you to do.

468
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,320
Take it when I ask you to take.

469
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,120
You follow my order.

470
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Is he your helper?

471
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,640
Captain Chen.

472
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,600
Captain Chen.

473
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,280
I thought you forgot me.

474
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,800
No, I didn't.

475
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,880
Got more guts lately?

476
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,800
No.

477
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,080
We're brothers.

478
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,920
Yes, we're friends.

479
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,000
Well, I'll leave you in peace.

480
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,080
We'll go now.

481
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,600
Bye, Tianxiang.

482
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,120
Wait.

483
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,360
Apologize.

484
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,280
Apologize.

485
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,800
Turn round.

486
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,840
Sorry.

487
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,120
Turn round.

488
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,520
Which direction did you turn?

489
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,440
Which direction did you turn?

490
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,600
Rember this

491
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,520
even if Officer Luo was not a police officer anymore,

492
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,760
you will never bully her.

493
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,920
Got it?

494
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes, sir.

495
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,560
Get lost.

496
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Thank you, Captain.

497
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,320
Thank you, Officer Xiang.

498
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,040
That day

499
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,000
when you and Qiushi visited us,

500
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,040
my father bought a cake for Qiushi.

501
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,520
But he forgot to give it to her.

502
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,040
So he ordered me go to ask the

503
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,440
the driver of rickshaw, Li

504
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,640
for your address.

505
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,280
And whom did you tell?

506
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,320
The owner of the mahjong parlor

507
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,920
where I was working.

508
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,600
This.

509
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,240
This photo is from him.

510
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,280
He said that was a business from the black market.

511
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,880
Someone was looking for the girl

512
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,280
in the picture.

513
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
He asked the people in mahjong parlor

514
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,160
to search for the girl.

515
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,680
It's said that the girl was worth a high bounty.

516
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
The moment I saw the picture,

517
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,160
I knew who she was.

518
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,480
But I hadn't told the owner.

519
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,280
However, the hatchet men threatened me

520
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,960
if I didn't give back the money,

521
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,120
they'd burn down my father's photo shop.

522
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,520
I was really scared.

523
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,560
I'm sorry for Minmin and Qiushi.

524
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I have a sister, too.

525
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,080
I don't know why they

526
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,160
are after her.

527
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,960
But she must be in trouble.

528
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,960
I don't mean to do that.

529
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,720
But I have no options.

530
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,400
This is the end of it.

531
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,320
Never let Luo Minmin know it.

532
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,960
Sorry.

533
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Sorry.

534
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,880
Where will you move to?

535
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
I have no idea.

536
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,400
To investigate the mahjong parlor first.

537
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,440
Then put on the uniform.

538
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,280
I've been suspended.

539
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,640
Only you are the police now.

540
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,200
Captain Chen welcome you.

541
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,800
Where is your boss?

542
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,560
He's inside.

543
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,920
I guess you remember this picture.

544
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,680
Tell me

545
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,600
who gave it to you?

546
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,600
Dealings

547
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,400
in black market

548
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,680
should be traceless.

549
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,040
If I break the rule

550
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,480
before you today,

551
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,800
I'll lose much in the future.

552
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,440
No one knows what will happen

553
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,560
in the future.

554
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,600
But now

555
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,400
you got a chance to earn double

556
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,480
out of one dealing

557
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,760
without losing any.

558
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,160
This is Yao Ji.

559
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,760
Er...

560
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,120
Captain Chen,

561
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,280
the friend of yours

562
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,080
is so honest

563
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,120
and knows nothing about the rules.

564
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,000
Tell us how much do you want directly.

565
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,320
This mahjong

566
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,000
represents 100 Yuan.

567
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,320
Well,

568
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,280
if you can't afford it.

569
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,920
Deal.

570
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,800
Well.

571
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,720
We can afford it.

572
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,680
Dare you take it?

573
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,560
What does Captain Chen mean?

574
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,240
I know the rules.

575
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,240
That's yours.

576
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,880
I will never

577
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,960
behave badly when it comes to

578
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,200
cooperating with the police.

579
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,400
However,

580
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,480
Captain Chen,

581
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,280
you must make sure that

582
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,320
the one in black market won't trouble me.

583
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,760
Tell me who gave it to you.

584
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,040
Alright.

585
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,680
Today, I will give Captain Chen

586
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,880
this courtesy.

587
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,120
This picture

588
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,160
is given by

589
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,600
Mr. Fan, the owner of the Dongguang pawnshop.

590
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,040
I must remind you two

591
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,320
don't go into dead end.

592
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,560
Before visiting officer Luo,

593
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,600
I'll draw cash and return your money.

594
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,760
Ronghua is right.

595
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,960
Money helps a lot.

596
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,280
Don't return it.

597
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,600
How much do you own?

598
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,080
Money isn't a problem for me.

599
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,760
Officer,

600
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,000
Sir.

601
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,200
May I ask if you are pawning things

602
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,320
or redeeming things today?

603
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,560
I'm here to find Mr. Fan.

604
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,520
May I have your name?

605
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,560
He didn't know me.

606
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,240
If you have any questions,

607
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,480
I might help, too.

608
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,720
I want to know

609
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,760
who is after the girl

610
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,040
in this picture?

611
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,000
Officer,

612
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,320
you must be kidding.

613
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,600
This is a pawn shop.

614
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,920
I don't understand

615
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,960
what you're saying.

616
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,720
You understand.

617
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,000
Please wait a minute.

618
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,640
Looking for help?

619
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,200
It's the call of nature.

620
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,920
Hold it.
