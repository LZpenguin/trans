English subtitles are available

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,200
Shooting Stars EP34

3
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,080
Xiang.

4
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,840
Why am I here?

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,240
A middle-aged woman noticed

6
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,720
you unconscious by the roadside

7
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
treated you with the gunshot wound,

8
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,760
and then brought you here.

9
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,680
Luckily,

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
it wasn't serious.

11
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,080
You need more rest.

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,960
Tianxiang!

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,160
Qinqin!

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
Qinqin!

15
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
Finally!

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
Mr. Xiang is in Dad's room.

17
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760
He's injured.

18
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,160
Dad.

19
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,440
How are you?

20
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,640
I'm okay,

21
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,680
just got shot.

22
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
Have you seen Chen Hao?

23
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
Where is he?

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
He...

25
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
He's

26
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,240
probably not in Shanghai.

27
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,960
Mr. Qiao?

28
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Yes.

29
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,800
The Captain is in the car.

30
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,920
Quick.

31
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,080
Careful.

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,920
Easy.

33
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,560
Leave the rest to us.

34
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,560
Mr. Qiao.

35
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
Although we haven't met before,

36
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
Ms. Shi told me

37
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,120
you can save the Captain.

38
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,840
Please

39
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,760
make sure

40
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,080
to help him survive.

41
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,320
Don't worry.

42
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,320
Go back now.

43
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,080
Newspaper!

44
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
Hot off the press!

45
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,240
Deputy Security Director

46
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,760
involved in munitions smuggling to Japan!

47
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
All documents

48
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
exposed!

49
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,960
Unmissable!

50
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,240
Come here!

51
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,680
One, please.

52
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,080
One for me, too.

53
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,360
News!

54
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,240
Hot off the press!

55
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Deputy Security Director

56
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,080
involved in munitions smuggling to Japan!

57
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,000
All documents

58
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,920
exposed!

59
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,960
I'm Peng Ganwen, a reporter

60
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,760
from Shen Bao.

61
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm here to accuse

62
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,800
the Deputy Security Director

63
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,280
of colluding with QX JV Corp

64
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,640
to smuggle munitions to Japan,

65
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,440
and the work of Nakamura Naoki

66
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,760
as the owner

67
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,320
of Hongji Benevolent Society

68
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,520
for his activities as a spy

69
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
for the Japanese Army Ministry.

70
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
The National Government

71
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,840
has repeatedly conceded,

72
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,280
and officials have provided shelter

73
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
for smuggling and tax evasion.

74
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Military discipline and forces

75
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,160
have thus been undermined.

76
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,040
All has enabled Japan to be lawless

77
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,560
in North and Northeast China.

78
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,960
Someone even shamelessly

79
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,160
served as a backup and profited greatly

80
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,080
from it.

81
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
The National Government

82
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
must thoroughly investigate

83
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,040
this smuggling route,

84
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,640
all officials who provided

85
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,160
inspection free passes

86
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
and exit permits for this route,

87
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,160
as well as the Corp behind!

88
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,120
This is the recording

89
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,400
of yesterday's rally in Shanghai.

90
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,160
Both

91
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,920
the pass and the waybill

92
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,360
were exposed the very evening,

93
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
and appeared

94
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,560
in 5 morning papers

95
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,920
in Shanghai and Nanjing today.

96
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,040
Tan Shiyuan promised

97
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,560
to take full responsibility

98
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,200
for the charges.

99
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
But there

100
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,800
must also be someone

101
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,280
within the company

102
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,440
to take the blame.

103
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,640
I can.

104
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,960
But listen,

105
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
Family Hua

106
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,560
will never

107
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,240
be ousted

108
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,960
from this table.

109
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,480
Not ever.

110
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Now

111
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,840
if you'll excuse me.

112
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,680
We've known each other

113
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,920
for a long time.

114
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,320
This is our first meeting as comrades.

115
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,160
Hello, Xiang Yuansheng.

116
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,080
Under pressure,

117
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,560
the Shinei Maru has been detained.

118
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,560
Hongji Benevolent Society was closed.

119
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,080
Nakamura Naoki

120
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,280
has been sent back to Japan.

121
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,680
The waves created by this rally

122
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,960
were bigger than anticipated.

123
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,520
Today, not just in Shanghai and Peking

124
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,280
masses in Nanjing

125
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,000
also flooded the streets

126
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,320
demanding the release

127
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
of the NSO's "Seven Gentlemen"

128
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,120
and an end

129
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,400
to the persecution of patriots.

130
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,040
The

131
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,960
power to resist

132
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,880
Japanese aggression

133
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,920
seems to be growing stronger.

134
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,720
The higher-ups

135
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,600
have greatly appreciated

136
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,800
the efforts made

137
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,080
by you, Chen Hao, and Mrs. Ji.

138
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
You are

139
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,440
the true unsung heroes.

140
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,640
Still no word from Chen Hao?

141
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,560
Jianshi

142
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,720
is temporarily out of touch.

143
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,800
But Chen Hao

144
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,280
always says he's lucky.

145
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,080
We expect to hear good news soon.

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,720
I've never doubted that.

147
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
Oh, yes.

148
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,280
I have

149
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,120
a new comrade

150
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
to introduce to you.

151
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,680
Hi, Xiang Yuansheng,

152
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,520
Nice to meet you.

153
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,680
No need for more info, right?

154
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,720
Shouldn't we

155
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,400
shake hands first?

156
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,520
When did you...

157
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,160
It's the Captain

158
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,240
who proposed to Ms. Shi.

159
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,360
After his proposal,

160
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,600
I reported it to the organization.

161
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,480
The application

162
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,640
has been approved.

163
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
No need to thank me.

164
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,720
Surprised?

165
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,840
Now we're comrades,

166
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,480
and I'll work hard.

167
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,600
Maybe

168
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,320
I'll be leading you one day.

169
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,280
Mrs. Ji

170
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,880
was originally named Lanxin,

171
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,800
meaning pure heart and personality.

172
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,880
She studied surgery

173
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,840
at St. John's University School of Medicine

174
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
and interned at Tongren Hospital.

175
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,400
She's the best

176
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,080
performing intern among those doctors.

177
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
Her husband

178
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,640
is her classmate from university.

179
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,120
They married after graduation

180
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,120
and joined

181
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,440
the Communist Party together,

182
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,880
immersing in a strong relationship.

183
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,000
They had a child

184
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,000
but sadly died young.

185
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,680
In 1931,

186
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
they joined

187
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
a medical team

188
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,480
heading to Northeast China.

189
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Her husband

190
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,800
died at a battlefield

191
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,640
rescue.

192
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,640
Then, she returned

193
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,600
to Shanghai alone,

194
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,480
and followed an order

195
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
to join in Mr. Deng's team.

196
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Publicly,

197
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,280
she's the owner of Zijin Tailor Shop.

198
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,120
But she's actually responsible

199
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,240
for resettling

200
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,080
new comrades in Shanghai

201
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,240
and transferring those at risk of exposure.

202
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
From that day,

203
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,560
she became known as Mrs. Ji.

204
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,120
How long have you

205
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,240
known her?

206
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,000
Five years.

207
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,080
When I first arrived

208
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,360
in Shanghai from Moscow,

209
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,000
I was a complete stranger.

210
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,160
It's pouring rain

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,880
the day I arrived.

212
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,840
She picked me up at the train station.

213
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,600
Mrs. Ji is to you

214
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,800
as Mr. Deng is to me.

215
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,640
Although their lives

216
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,000
were ended by the enemy's gunfire,

217
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,680
I believe

218
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,520
they never had any regrets.

219
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,800
They are forever immortal.

220
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Their ideals

221
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,000
are ours.

222
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,720
No matter how long it takes,

223
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,320
they

224
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,480
will eventually be realized.

225
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,560
Coming!

226
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,920
Hongfa!

227
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,360
How's the fish?

228
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,160
Coming!

229
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,840
Hurry up!

230
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,480
Why this?

231
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't you need it first?

232
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,480
We always start

233
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,560
with celery.

234
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,400
During these years

235
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640
at the Fourth Station,

236
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,280
I've never seen anyone cook in this order.

237
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,800
It's

238
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
true.

239
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,560
Our Chief has been cooking

240
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,520
for long,

241
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
his food really isn't good.

242
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,680
It's awful.

243
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,280
I cook for you,

244
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,560
and this is how

245
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,520
you repay me!

246
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
My bad!

247
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,680
Alright, eggs are ready!

248
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,560
Coming!

249
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,160
Move the knife!

250
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,840
We're about to eat.

251
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,080
When are you planning to leave?

252
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
In a day or two.

253
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,680
Have you packed everything?

254
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,520
Not much.

255
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Almost done.

256
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,600
Then...

257
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,000
Minmin!

258
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Come help me with the dishes!

259
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,560
When can we eat?

260
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
We're all waiting.

261
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,280
Stop nagging.

262
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,920
I'll do it.

263
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,480
Pound the garlic!

264
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,080
No problem.

265
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,800
Wait,

266
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,560
you're so slow!

267
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,240
Look at this.

268
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
You scrape it yourself.

269
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,360
No, I'm scared.

270
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,280
I'll do it then.

271
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,240
Clumsy!

272
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,600
Here, I got it.

273
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,280
I'll do it.

274
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,720
Can you not...

275
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,240
Wait a second.

276
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,160
Wait...

277
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
Is this you or Minmin?

278
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,840
Definitely me.

279
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,840
Can't recognize.

280
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,960
I'm getting prettier,

281
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,200
right?

282
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Guess who this is?

283
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,000
You, maybe?

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Must be Minmin!

285
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,200
How ugly!

286
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,880
After born,

287
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,560
she's always

288
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,840
mistaken for a boy.

289
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,960
Don't ever tell her that.

290
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,360
It's a deal.

291
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,320
Dinner time!

292
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,840
Over here!

293
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,920
Tianxiang, come!

294
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,080
The fish is really good.

295
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,920
Chopsticks!

296
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,520
Put it in the middle.

297
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,360
Have a sit!

298
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,960
Hurry up.

299
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,920
Chief, please.

300
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,200
The rice

301
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,640
with veggies!

302
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,040
This wine...

303
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,000
Where's Hongfa?

304
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,720
No idea.

305
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,320
Take a seat.

306
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,080
Is this wine...

307
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,520
Sit here.

308
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,440
From a restaurant?

309
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,360
Or the Station House?

310
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,360
I remember

311
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,240
the first time Yuansheng came,

312
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,640
he had 3 bowls of rice with veggies.

313
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
He ate too much.

314
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,160
Made me so distressed.

315
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,400
It's my first time having it.

316
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,280
Then, out of control.

317
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,960
I made it again today

318
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,400
with newly arrived rice

319
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,200
and the veggies

320
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,080
Tianxiang and Qinqin

321
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,080
bought back early in the morning.

322
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
Plenty more in the pot,

323
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,560
enough for everyone.

324
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,360
Thank you all.

325
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,720
Let's bid

326
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,320
Yuansheng

327
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,680
farewell.

328
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,600
Sure.

329
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,560
Cheers!

330
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,240
Cheers!

331
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,160
All the best.

332
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,080
Thanks.

333
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,920
Safe trip.

334
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
Best regards.

335
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,640
Cool!

336
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,400
This wine is good.

337
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,320
Try some.

338
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,520
Minmin kept watching

339
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,920
over the stove to make this.

340
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,600
She said it's your favourite.

341
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Eat it while it's hot.

342
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,680
You won't get this

343
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,080
after leaving Shanghai.

344
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,160
This is

345
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,240
your second time leaving, right?

346
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,240
Yes.

347
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,440
After first visit to Shanghai,

348
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,200
you became a police officer with us.

349
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
On the second occasion,

350
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,440
the Station was disbanded.

351
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,240
But our friendship

352
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,440
has grown stronger.

353
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,960
Precisely.

354
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,360
I don't wanna leave

355
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,440
this time more than last time.

356
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,840
The rally

357
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,280
has really hit

358
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,400
us hard.

359
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,080
Hongfa, Tianxiang and I

360
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,120
have all decided

361
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,520
to join the NSO

362
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,640
and contribute

363
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,600
to the salvation movement.

364
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,280
Although I was a deserter before,

365
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,800
I won't be this time around

366
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,440
in joining the NSO.

367
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,240
Yuansheng,

368
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,800
how about

369
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,360
continuing to be with us?

370
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,480
Even if I don't stay,

371
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,000
we'll

372
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,600
be on the same road.

373
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,560
That's right.

374
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:16,880
Agreed.

375
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,800
I propose

376
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,840
a toast

377
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,960
to our Fourth Station.

378
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Wait a minute.

379
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
Before the toast,

380
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
do you remember the slogan

381
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,400
of the Fourth Station?

382
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,720
To uphold justice

383
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
and protect the public.

384
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,200
Exactly.

385
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Don't you think I forgot it?

386
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Come on.

387
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,200
Yuansheng,

388
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,720
do you know what the Director said

389
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,000
when you first appeared?

390
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
"This boy

391
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,080
is marketable."

392
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,080
Did I say anything that cheesy?

393
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,400
Yeah.

394
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,720
Don't act like you didn't.

395
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Something wrong with it?

396
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,240
He is a pretty boy indeed.

397
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,960
Let's have a toast

398
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,440
to the pretty boy!

399
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Come on.

400
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,440
He is so pretty

401
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,080
that he despised partnering

402
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,120
with me at that time.

403
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,400
Fortunately, I chose Dongbao

404
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,000
as my partner first...

405
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,000
Anyway,

406
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,240
Yu,

407
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,680
Dongbao promised

408
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,640
to start up a breakfast shop

409
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,160
with you.

410
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,720
We've chosen a good place for the shop.

411
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,120
It's just next door

412
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,240
to the Hongfa Restaurant.

413
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,840
Yes.

414
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,960
When the shop opens,

415
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,920
we'll help you clean it up together.

416
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,720
And we'll also look after

417
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,080
the baby after his birth.

418
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,800
You have so many friends here.

419
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
We won't let you suffer.

420
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,280
Tell us if you need any help.

421
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,280
We're always on call.

422
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,360
Yes.

423
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,280
Thank you for all your care

424
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
and support these days.

425
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
Allow me to thank you

426
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,320
with tea toast.

427
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,360
You're so kind.

428
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,280
We are a big family.

429
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,560
Yuansheng,

430
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
Do you have any news

431
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
about Chenhao?

432
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,880
I haven't

433
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,840
had any message from him.

434
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,160
I don't even know whether he's alive or not.

435
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,360
Director,

436
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,800
you've known him

437
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,000
for such a long time.

438
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,920
Then you must know

439
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,480
how lucky he is.

440
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,680
I'm sure he can turn danger into safety.

441
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,360
You're right.

442
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,760
Every time he's in trouble,

443
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,520
there's always someone who helped him out,

444
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,800
believe it or not.

445
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,160
Shall I propose a toast?

446
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,720
OK.

447
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,200
Alright.

448
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,080
New Year is coming.

449
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
It's our

450
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,640
first gathering this winter.

451
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,000
I hope

452
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,240
we could gather together

453
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
every year thereafter.

454
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,000
Shall we?

455
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,680
Sure!

456
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,600
I wish

457
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,640
all our comrades here,

458
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,680
certainly as well as

459
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,720
the missing boy

460
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,000
though I don't know where he is,

461
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,800
a safe and peaceful future

462
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,560
and a healthy build.

463
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,600
Together!

464
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,120
Forever!

465
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,520
A safe and peace future

466
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,280
and a healthy build.

467
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,640
Bottoms up!

468
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,240
The alcohol is so strong.

469
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
And spicy.

470
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,160
Sit down and have some food.

471
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,360
Even my ears taste the piquancy.

472
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,160
We've worked so hard this year.

473
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
When the New Year comes,

474
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,520
we should meet in my home

475
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,080
whenever you're available.

476
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,000
Good idea.

477
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,440
I'll show you my cooking skills.

478
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,800
When did you come back?

479
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,560
Not long ago.

480
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,800
But I'll leave soon.

481
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,280
I got an order to return to Nanjing.

482
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,920
I know you're waiting for his message.

483
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,720
He asked me to hand it over

484
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,960
to you in person.

485
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,840
Is he fine?

486
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,280
After I picked him up,

487
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,240
I sent him to a hospital.

488
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,920
He has been recovering these days.

489
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,920
But doctor said

490
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,520
it's impossible

491
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,080
to take out the debris left in his lungs.

492
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,360
Mrs. Ji had told me.

493
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,320
Before I left him,

494
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,960
he already had

495
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,920
some gunshot sequelae

496
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,880
slowly emerging.

497
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,160
He's optimistic

498
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,240
and he faces

499
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,040
all possible consequences

500
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
with a peaceful attitude.

501
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,560
Will he return to Shanghai?

502
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,120
Not for now.

503
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,720
Although we're far apart from each other,

504
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,120
I don't why

505
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,200
but I just

506
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
have a feeling that all of us are still together.

507
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,640
No matter what happens in the future,

508
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,160
we shall be fearless

509
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,760
as long as we are part of the organization.

510
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,280
Just like seeing the sun

511
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,520
rise from the horizon.

512
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,120
Just like seeing the light

513
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,240
shine on the hazy plain.

514
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,000
At this moment,

515
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,440
I firmly believe

516
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,720
this bright scenery

517
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
is not far from us any more.

518
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,560
Where are you going

519
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,600
for your new mission?

520
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,960
Guangzhou.

521
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,320
Apart from the mission,

522
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,280
the organization worries that

523
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,920
my identity would bring me danger

524
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,720
If I stay in Shanghai or Nanjing.

525
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,440
It's a protective move

526
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,280
to send me to an unknown city.

527
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,560
What about you?

528
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,480
Me?

529
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,920
I'll keep staying in Shanghai.

530
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,800
Zijin Tailor Shop is no longer safe.

531
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,000
I want to take over Mrs. Ji's position.

532
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,640
And I want to try

533
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,680
to establish

534
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,280
the photo studio

535
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,520
into the next transfer station.

536
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,000
These days

537
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
I will learn from Ms. Shi

538
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,080
so that I can be competent for the job.

539
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,280
In Guangzhou,

540
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,000
remember to take care of yourself.

541
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,120
I will.

542
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,600
So

543
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,960
we say goodbye here.

544
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,240
Mind if I hug you?

545
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,720
I don't know

546
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,120
when we will meet

547
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
next time.

548
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,080
At least,

549
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,520
we should shake our hands.

550
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,320
I would be regretful

551
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,160
if we bade farewell

552
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,880
without shaking hands.

553
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,280
Alright.

554
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,800
If you

555
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,280
occasionally thought of us,

556
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,080
you could write to us.

557
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,320
I will miss you.

558
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,160
I've chosen a path

559
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,200
that I believe

560
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,560
it is correct.

561
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,200
And I want to go

562
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,280
straight down this road.

563
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,120
But I don't know

564
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
when I will reach the destination.

565
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,560
I want to tell you to wait for me in Shanghai.

566
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,120
Or I want you to know

567
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,200
I'll be waiting for you in Guangzhou.

568
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,560
But if we couldn't meet

569
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,640
each other ever since,

570
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,520
I'd rather bear no hope.

571
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,600
I don't care even if I might be disappointed.

572
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,840
I'll be waiting for you in Shanghai.

573
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,320
Xiang Yuansheng.

574
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,960
Even though you're far away,

575
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,960
my thoughts make you present as in the days gone by.

576
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,360
I'll be waiting for you in Shanghai.

577
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,640
"Don't feel sad because of departure,"

578
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,520
"the destination will be a hopeful future."

579
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,280
A few months is not that long,

580
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,280
but fairly enough to change everything.

581
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,560
Xiang Yuansheng, don't be impulsive.

582
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,240
Xiang Yuansheng,

583
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,640
come out!

584
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,800
You've caused us a lot of trouble.

585
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,760
You are not qualified.

586
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,920
They said you join the Communist Party.

587
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,120
I don't care who is my partner

588
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,200
because I don't need

589
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,000
a partner here.

590
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
It smells good.

591
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,160
Yuansheng.

592
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,800
It is Yuansheng, indeed.

593
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,160
I should call you officer Xiang instead.

594
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,800
So weird.

595
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,960
I remember when I first came to Shanghai,

596
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,520
I walked

597
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,760
on the same street.

598
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,320
At that time,

599
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,640
I firmly believed

600
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,200
that I was walking

601
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,040
on an absolutely correct road.

602
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,760
Until

603
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,000
I met them.

604
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,680
It's a police officer‘s duty to fight for justice,

605
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,640
and to protect the public.

606
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,520
It just like

607
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,080
a doctor can't choose his patients,

608
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,440
and a soldier can't select a battlefield.

609
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,480
I always believe

610
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,560
it's the same to a police officer.

611
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,600
To let China rise up

612
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,360
and to create a prosperous and peaceful country.

613
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,080
Until now,

614
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,560
my ideals remain the same.

615
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,880
Even in the most emergency situation,

616
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,840
Get on the car.

617
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,080
they still made

618
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,320
the best decision.

619
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,800
You are such a good

620
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,520
and competent policeman.

621
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
I just found

622
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,680
I am

623
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,840
actually so unfamiliar

624
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,040
with my home country

625
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,440
She's not only a police officer,

626
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,680
she is just a girl!

627
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,480
What about you?

628
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
And the senior?

629
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,560
What about your promise to Luo Minmin?

630
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,760
What about your promise to the Fourth Station?

631
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,720
I pulled

632
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,720
the button down

633
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,760
from the assailant.

634
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
Does it help?

635
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,120
Don't worry.

636
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,520
It helps.

637
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,680
It must be useful.

638
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,560
I want my resignation letter back.

639
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,680
Don't move!

640
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,440
It's them who changed my mind

641
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
and make me grow up.

642
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,160
I, Luo Minmin request to return to the crew

643
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,160
Enjoy the cooperation.

644
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,920
Hope everything is ducky.

645
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,080
Some strength is beyond ability.

646
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,840
This never

647
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,240
occurred to me before.

648
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,440
Officer Xiang.

649
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm married.

650
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,960
You're married?

651
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,480
He wants to open

652
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
a breakfast shop for Yu,

653
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,360
and has a child of them.

654
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,680
It will be a wonderful life.

655
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,280
Dongbao doesn't need your money.

656
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,480
What are you on guard against?

657
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,640
Are you on guard against me?

658
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,800
Somebody help!

659
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,600
People are not actually that insignificant.

660
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,560
Yes.

661
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,160
We are much stronger

662
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,800
than we thought.

663
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
Do you really want to break your life plan

664
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,520
just for a so-called answer?

665
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,000
I must know the truth.

666
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,640
You're not the only one who pursues the truth.

667
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,800
Welcome back.

668
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,000
How do you want me to understand you?

669
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,960
Do you want to be

670
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
a traitor and collaborator to our country?

671
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,920
It's your family's fault,

672
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,560
not yours.

673
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,680
It's never too late

674
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,120
to choose the right path.

675
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,800
Take it.

676
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,160
Punctuality.

677
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,160
The reason why

678
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,720
I look back on these moments

679
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,400
is because they

680
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,560
were like shooting stars,

681
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,240
sparkling and shining.

682
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,640
They light up

683
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,000
the fading darkness.

684
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,080
The greatest fortune in life

685
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,280
is to set up life purpose

686
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,320
at a strong and young age.

687
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,000
It's a hardest farewell

688
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,360
when we left each other,

689
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,440
but fortunately,

690
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
I'm no longer

691
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,280
confused about my direction.

692
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,880
Qin,

693
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,840
let me call a rickshaw for you.

694
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,760
No thanks dad.

695
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,440
I run faster than a rickshaw.

696
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,200
Come on!

697
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,480
Don't worry.

698
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,880
I will pass the exam!

699
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,280
Watch out!

700
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,240
Stay still.

701
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,760
Three, two, one.

702
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,000
Ms. Shi,

703
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,720
you can pick up the photo

704
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,360
the day after tomorrow.

705
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,480
OK.

706
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,160
Does your sister have an exam today?

707
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,080
Yes.

708
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,320
She applied for the entry to Medical University.

709
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,680
She always did well in the study.

710
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,240
I believe she will be admitted.

711
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,600
My brother is also a doctor.

712
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,920
It's a good profession.

713
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,200
I would congratulate her in advance.

714
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,120
Thank you.

715
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,440
Jianshi is in Shanghai.

716
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,440
He wants to meet you

717
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,200
at the same place

718
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,720
Luo Minmin,

719
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,480
you need to practice

720
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,560
your facial expression management more.

721
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,200
Yes, madam.

722
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,560
Take it easy.

723
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,840
Hello, is anyone there?

724
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,280
Yes.

725
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,960
Do you want to take photos?

726
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,440
Yes,

727
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,920
we want to take a set of couple photos.

728
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,680
OK.

729
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,520
This way please.

730
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,280
Goodbye Ms. Shi.

731
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,360
You want to take some couple photos.

732
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,920
Yes.

733
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,640
Do you like poems?

734
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,840
I only read

735
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,120
'The Train' of Taranci.

736
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,360
Do you know what's

737
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,640
the sentence on the locomotive?

738
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,520
Bridges are strong,

739
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
tunnel light.

740
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,320
Long time no see.

741
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,200
Long time no see.
