If it's really inconvenient for you,

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,800
we can talk here.

5
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
It won't take long.

6
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,240
Captain Wei,

7
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
don't you think it's

8
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,120
a bit abrupt for our first meeting?

9
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,680
Sorry.

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,640
But I'm here for the murder case.

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,920
[I discovered that]

[you might be]

even more concerned about her safety

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,800
than I am.

18
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,920
I need to buy something

19
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,600
across the street.

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,840
If necessary,

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
we can walk and talk.

[Sounds good.]

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,400
Ms. Shi,

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,040
why so late today?

25
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,600
Just finished up.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,600
Are these flowers fresh?

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes, arrived this afternoon.

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,640
Take your pick.

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,720
Ms. Shi,

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,640
do you recognize the person

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,360
in this photo?

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,640
No.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,120
Has anyone from

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,760
the Mengs...

35
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,040
Are they also new today?

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,600
[Yes, you can take some.]

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,920
Has anyone from the Mengs

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
mentioned him?

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,920
His name is Hua Zhen.

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,040
Take a look.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,680
Mr. and Mrs. Meng

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
have so many friends.

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
I can't possibly keep track of them all.

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,080
Is he involved in the murder case?

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Not exactly.

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,360
I just heard

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
he might be

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
harboring Duoci.

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,800
As her teacher,

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,200
I thought

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
you might know more than I do.

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,400
I haven't heard anything.

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
Does your detective team

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
also handle missing persons?

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
It's not that.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,960
I'll take this.

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,960
Just the network of friends

58

59

A friend from the police station

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,120
asked me to inquire.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,480
Captain Wei,

62
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,400
which one do you think

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,560
is better for tying my flowers?

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,320
To match your elegance,

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,040
this one suits you best.

66
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,040
Good.

Oh, I can do it.

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,560
You're not planning

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,640
to suffocate my flowers

72
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
in the trunk, are you?

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,440
Not at all.

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,840
No need.

75
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,840
It's amazing

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,960
to spray perfume

77
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,640
in the trunk.

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,080
So strong,

79
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,280
I mean.

80
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,920
You may not understand

81

a woman's obsession with flowers and perfume.

82
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,720
Sorry,

83

I couldn't be more helpful.

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,640
I'm also very worried about Duoci.

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,040
So please have your police friends

86
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,080
find her soon.

87
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,560

owe a little

111
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
to me.

112

But

113

the main credit

114

goes to our Captain Chen!

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
It was his

earnest guidance,

and virtue that...

119
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Why are you pulling me?

120
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,280
Embarrassed?

121
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,080
Your face is all red.

Where was I?

123
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,880
His virtue.

124
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,640
Right, because of his virtue,

125
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,480
he negotiated

126
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,760
with the female inspector

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,200
and successfully

128
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,080
deterred her!

129
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,640
Let's give him

130
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,280
the loudest applause to show

131
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,840

132
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,720

[I'll cook it for you.]

Close the door.

Can we get the suspect back

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,480
from the precinct now?

141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,200
Of course.

142
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,360
Hello,

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,680
this is Captain Chen

144
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,720
from the Fourth Station House.

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,840
My suspect...

146
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,240
When?

147
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,840
Where?

148
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,840
Hello?

149
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Hello?

150
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,480
What's wrong?

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
He ran away.

152
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,000
Who said that?

153
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,520
Wang Yong

154
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,920
working for Feng Guangyun.

155
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,960
He said the guy

156
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,000
jumped out of the transport vehicle

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,920
the day they took him away

158
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,360
and hasn't been found since.

159
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
How could he possibly escape

160
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
from so many police officers?

161
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
That's what Wang Yong said.

162
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,720
That day when we're questioning...

163
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
He's rummaging

164
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,720
around in the room

165
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
for something.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
[But I was the first one]

167
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,080
[to rush in.]

168
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,440
[The room was neat,]

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,840
No signs of anything being rifled through.

170
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
So,

171
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,680
the killer may be

172
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,280
looking for something.

173
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,720
And he restored everything before leaving.

174
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,440
Possibly.

175
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,440
Now that we have no eyewitness,

176
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
we definitely won't get a sketch.

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,000
The case has been

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
handed over to the precinct,

179
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
we won't get any new leads.

180
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,600
What's your plan?

181
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,840
I'll think of another way.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,720
Yuansheng,

183
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,440
I once asked you

184
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,960
why you're so determined

185
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,000
in the murder case.

186
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,480
You said, that's for an honour.

187
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,560
[You have lots of other choices,]

188
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,560
[why this one?]

189
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
A kid hired me

190
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,520
with a string of beads

191
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,560
and 23 silver dollars

192
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,920
to solve her case,

193
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,080
and I agreed.

194
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,560
That's the truth,

195
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,960
but do you believe it?

196
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
Yes.

197
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,600
If I were you,

198
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,320
I'd do the same.

199
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
[Waiter, a glass of water!]

200
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,240
Yes, sir.

201
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,120
It's your turn.

202
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
You're a bit slow today.

203
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,240
Right.

204
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,760
We're all waiting.

205
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,840
Feeling a bit sleepy, huh?

206
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,080
Here you go.

207
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,120
[Come on.]

208
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
[No, thanks.]

209
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,520
You gave me

210
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,400
such a hot cup of water.

211
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,360
What were you thinking?

212
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,840
Sorry.

213
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm... really sorry.

214
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,400
What else

215
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,960
can you say?

216
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,520
No wonder

217
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,560
I had bad luck today.

218
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,960
It's all because of you!

219
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
[Guys!]

220
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,080
[The boss is calling!]

221
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,040
Calm down. Let's continue.

222
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,120
Get lost!

223
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,640
[Tianxiang!]

224
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,520
[Hurry up!]

225
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,080
[Enough.]

226
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
[Get back.]

227
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Send this photo out.

228
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,280
[Someone is offering]

229
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,360
[100 silver dollars]

230
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,160
for this little girl in the picture.

232
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
My goodness.

234
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,480
[That much!]

235
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,880
[If we find her,]

236
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
[split it fifty-fifty.]

237
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,880
[That much money,]

238
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,880
[what kind of trouble]

239
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
[is the girl in?]

240
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,680
This is my big brother.

241
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,400
And this is Mr. Xiang.

242
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,040
Nice to meet you.

243
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,160
Alright,

244
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,920
I'll take you upstairs, okay?

245
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Wait here for me.

246
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
[In your spare time,]

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,600
[look around properly,]

248
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
[make some extra cash,]

249
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
help out the family.

250
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
[Sounds cool.]

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,040
[Boss, what will happen]

252
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,000
[after this girl]

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,920
[is found?]

254
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Cut the crap.

255
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,800
This is easy money.

256
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,840
Try your best.

257
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,600
Don't care about too much.

258
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,360
[You okay?]

259
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,960
[Yes.]

260
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,840
Go back to work.

261
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,600
Tianxiang.

262
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,680
I've brought back

263
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,520
your laundry.

264
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,360
Minmin,

265
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,920
are you familiar with

266
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,720
Mr. Xiang's sister?

267
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,480
Not really.

268
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,720
I've only seen her once.

269
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,840
She has a tough life.

270
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,920
She seems to

271
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,040
really like you though.

272
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
She eats

273
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,400
everything you cook with such gusto.

274
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,280
Really?

275
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,240
All set.

276
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,240
Good night.

277
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,360
[Is it salty?]

278
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,840
Not at all!

279
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,400
[That's good.]

280
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,880
[You like the food]

281
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,920
[my brother cook?]

282
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,080
I do!

283
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,360
Director An,

284
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,120
may I ask

285
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,960
you something?

286
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,600
Go ahead.

287
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,080
I heard...

288
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,560
that

289
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,280
Undersecretary Hua's son,

290
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,440
from

291
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,680
a regular class

292
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,120
of the Army University

293
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,960
like you, right?

294
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,480
Are you familiar with each other?

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Of course.

296
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
We're classmates.

297
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,360
Do you know

298
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,880
if he had any contact with Communists

299
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
when he's at school?

300
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,400
The Chairman Jiang

301
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
used to work with Zhou Enlai.

302
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,120
What do you want to ask?

303
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,080
I'm just particular curious.

304
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,640
I heard that he's

305
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,120
a top student.

306
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
Why did he change his career

307
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
to join the Navy?

308
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,720
It is so confusing.

309
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
I understand.

310
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
You think it's because of Deng Mingyuan?

311
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,720
Maybe I'm too obsessed

312
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
with investigating him.

313
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,520
Hua Zhen should have come to Shanghai.

314
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,960
Back to Nanjing long ago.

315
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,080
I sent him to the railway station myself.

316
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
When he was in Shanghai,

317
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,320
did he ask you

318
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,600
about Deng Mingyuan,

319
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
or people and things

320
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,720
related to him?

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,480
We're just talking about

322
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,120
our past at school.

323
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,640
But as for the specific content,

324
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,720
I can't tell you.

325
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,240
Actually, I went to ask the conductor

326
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
of the train you just mentioned.

327
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
He said that Hua Zhen

328
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,480
didn't get on the train that day

329
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,120
but quietly stayed in Shanghai.

330
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,480
[He neither told you]

331
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,200
nor contacted anyone.

332
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,440
The thread of the witness is broken.

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,760
We have to think of

334
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
other ways now.

335
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,200
Chen Hao and I suspect that

336
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,360
the killer wanna get something

337
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,520
from your family.

338
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,440
[Maybe we can take advantage of this]

339
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,320
[to entice him out.]

340
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
It's just speculation.

341
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
But we don't have any other clues,

342
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,880
so we have to try it this way.

343
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,080
Are you going there alone?

344
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,240
Yes.

345
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,200
I'll go to your house this afternoon,

346
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
and see if I can figure out

347
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,600
what the killer is looking for.

348
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,120
You wait for me at home.

349
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,320
The newspaper

350
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,200
said that

351
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,040
the memorial service

352
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,680
for my parents

353
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,120
will be held this afternoon.

354
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
You wanna go back?

355
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,240
May I?

356
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480

not money

450
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,040

Therefore,

his's first looking for something

460
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,240
rather than you,

461
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,040
indicating that his real purpose

462
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,920
is still an object.

463
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,560

Remember HSBC

468

469

Mr. Meng

482
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,600

483
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,080

00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,760
Hurry up.

534
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,520
Go.

535
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,320
What's up?

536
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,680
I...

537
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
don't wanna see you continue investigating.

538
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,320
Why?

539
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,240
You've got injured

540
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,680
for catching the killer.

541
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,960
I don't want

542
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,800
to see

543
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,360
such a thing happen.

544
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,480
I can hide

545
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
in Shanghai alone.

546
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,960
You go back to Nanjing.

547
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,080
You exchanged everything

548
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,920
for me to work for you

549
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,480
for a month, didn't you?

550
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,640
Forget it.

551
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,200
I keep my word

552
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
not only for you,

553
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,920
but for the man

554
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
who asked me to come to Shanghai.

555
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,800
Besides,

556
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,680
we have a clue now, haven't we?

557
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,320
You mean the safe?

558
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,440
Right.

559
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,720
You're the key.

560
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,120
That's why the killer

561
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,240
has been looking for you.

562
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,640
Let's sneak into the bank

563
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,760
and take the things away.

564
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,680
This is not a solution.

565
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,000
The killer knows

566
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,240
you are the key,

567
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,000
so he won't give up searching for you.

568
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,280
I do have a plan

569
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,200
that might draw him out,

570
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,320
but it requires

571
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
some preparation.

572
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,960
Go to bed.

573
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,840
Are you leaving the Fourth Station?

574
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,400
I've already

575
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,280
obtained what I want.

576
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,120
There is no need for me

577
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,000
to stay there any longer.
