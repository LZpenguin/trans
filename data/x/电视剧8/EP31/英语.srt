Yes.

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Ms. Shi is tied up with official duties,

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,320
so she asked me to assist.

16
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,760
Does Mr. Chen

17
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,800
have any injuries

18
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,080
other than the gunshot wound?

No,

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,160
he was shot in the right chest.

21
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,640
I've done basic disinfection,

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,720
but the wound is inflamed,

23
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,960
likely still has bullet fragments.

24
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,440
Understood, leave it to me.

25
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,360
I saw

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
a "Closed" sign at the entrance.

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,080
We won't have

28
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,760
other visitors here, right?

29
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Normally not.

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,920
The sign is up year-round

31
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,600
to prevent people from accidental entry.

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,760
This place is a dedicated

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,720
Alright,

35
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,760
then I'll go park the car a bit further

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,920
to avoid attracting police.

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,160
Can I help?

38
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,960
Close the door for me.

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,640
This is your Council pass.

40
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Are the two cars behind also with you?

41

They're my plainclothes officers.

They won't be far.

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,080

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
that police from Shiliupu Police Station

53
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,800
have crossed the border.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,120
What are they up to?

55
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
They claim they're pursuing a fugitive.

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,120
Do we know

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,080
which streets they've headed to?

58
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
They went west,

59
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
near Changle Road.

60
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,640
Let's cooperate as needed.

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
This falls under our

62
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
joint enforcement obligations.

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,280

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,440
The wound has been stitched up.

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,840
I happen to have an empty storage room,

67
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,640
very secluded

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
and unlikely to draw attention.

69
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,280
We'll evacuate through the back door

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,360
and discuss further once we're there.

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,800
Okay.

72
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
They're here.

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,160
Get inside.

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
I'll draw them away.

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,680
You seek a chance to get out.

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,160

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,040
Who are you looking for?

85
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Mr. Hua,

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
glad to meet you again.

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,960
Weren't you supposed to be in Nanjing?

88
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,960
Why are you still here?

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
Starting a book business now?

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,960
Do you need something from me,

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
Mr. Wei?

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,600
From you?

93
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm too busy

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
for that.

95
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
We've received intelligence

96
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,160
that there are Communists

97
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,240
frequenting this bookstore.

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,480
And here you are again,

99
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
Mr. Hua,

100
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,200
care to explain?

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
Always popping up

102
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
where Communists are rumored to be.

103
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,120
I don't need to report my actions to you.

104
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,320
Do you have a search warrant?

105
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,360
This trivial matter

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,520
doesn't require a warrant.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,720
As long as I'm here,

108
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,080
you need

109
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,040
a warrant to search.

110
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:01,960
You know

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,320
I left the Shanghai Garrison Command,

112
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,160
right?

113
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,120
Then under what authority

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
are you searching my place?

115
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,200
A legitimate authority.

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
I can't

117
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,680
disclose specifics.

118
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Serving the nation, duty calls,

119
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,480
it doesn't matter what my title is.

120
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Found a

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,240
new gig so quickly, huh?

122
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,440
Secret Service

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,240
of the Reviving Society?

124
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,120
Any role will bring you to justice.

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,640
You've seen what you needed to see.

126
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,960
Shall I personally escort you out?

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,920
No rush.

128
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,560
Mr. Hua,

129
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
I've heard

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
you visited

131
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
an apartment at No. 16, Maiqi Road,

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,920
room 302, to be precise.

133
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,680
That's a known safehouse

134
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,280
for the NSO,

135
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,800
which is

136
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
affiliated with the Communists.

137
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,640
Mr. Hua,

138
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,960
tell me,

139
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,640
why were you there?

140
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,640
Can't I visit someone?

141
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,680
A visit?

142
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,280
Is the occupant a friend of yours?

143
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Just an acquaintance.

144
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,800
An acquaintance?

145
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,080
How did you meet?

146
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Where did you meet?

147
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,240
Since you're so eager to chat,

148
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
why don't we go somewhere else?

149
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
How about the Reviving Society?

150
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,480
Brazen as always.

151
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,520
I'm telling you,

152
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,440
if you end up

153
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
at the Secret Service of the Reviving Society,

154
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,120
no one will be able to help you.

155
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,200
Isn't that

156
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
the purpose of your visit?

157
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
Wait!

158
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,280
You're not acting brazenly,

159
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,400
you seem nervous,

160
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,840
not like your usual self.

161
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,160
This is your

162
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,400
last chance to take me

163
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
before I

164
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,680
walk out of here.

165
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,720
Hua Zhen!

166
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
Another step

167
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,520
and I'll shoot you!

168
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,200
Stop testing my patience!

169
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,600
You were so eager trying to lure me out.

170
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,360
What's the plan?

171
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
Expecting your

172
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,880
Communist friends outside,

173
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,760
or are they

174
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,880
hidden inside?

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,200
Put the gun down!

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,600
No more games!

177
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,360
Stay calm.

178
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,040
Remember what

179
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,600
Mr. Yu tasked us with.

180
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,080
Shut up!

181
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,360
Mr. Yu said,

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,240
he wants him alive.

183
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,440
Zhou,

184
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
we've looked everywhere.

185
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,600
Where is he?

186
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,400
It's Hua Zhen!

187
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,560
After him!

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
There is indeed

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,960
Communist ambushing outside.

190
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
We can't let him get away like this.

191
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,960
Cover me!

192
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,400
Stop right there!

193
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,040
Hua Zhen,

194
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
turn around slowly.

195
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,880
Drop your gun on the ground!

196
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,240
Where's Hua Zhen?

197
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,040
He got into a car and headed east.

198
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
We need to catch up!

199
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
The police are almost here.

200
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,720
Let's head back to the Reviving Society.

201
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,480
Stay undercover!

202
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,360
You will get shot!

203
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
Are you hurt?

204
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,880
No.

205
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,760
How come you came over?

206
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,360
I got a report

207
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
at the Council about

208
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
someone targeting Changle Road,

209
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,720
so I rushed over.

210
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
Thanks.

211
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,840
How's Chen Hao doing now?

212
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,480
Any better?

213
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,280
He's managing,

214
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,760
thanks to Mrs. Ji,

215
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,240
who took care of his wounds.

216
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,520
How did he get shot?

217
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,120
To save me.

218
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,080
Feng Guangyun from the Shiliupu Police Station

219
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,440
had abducted two officers from the Fourth Station,

220
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
one of whom has been killed.

221
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,760
The other,

222
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,720
Luo Minmin,

223
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,320
was rescued by me and Chen Hao.

224
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
He got shot

225
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,600
during the rescue.

226
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,240
This way.

227
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,880
Mrs. Ji.

228
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,440
Come in quickly.

229
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,240
Ms. Shi,

230
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
are you all okay?

231
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,320
Ms. Shi saved me.

232
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
How's Chen Hao?

233
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,920
He's inside.

234
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,200
He hasn't woken up yet

235
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,120
and still unconscious.

236
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,600
Noted.

237
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,840
He's inside.

238
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,840
His gunshot wound, how is it?

239
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,560
The bullet

240
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,200
penetrated from his back to his chest

241
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,000
but fortunately didn't hit

242
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,600
any major organs or blood vessels.

243
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,560
Now,

244
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
the main issue is the wound infection.

245
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,560
I've done a debridement

246
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
and cleaned the wound.

247
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
Were all the bullet fragments removed?

248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,240
They've all been removed,

249
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,600
successfully.

250
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,880
Mr. Chen has a strong constitution

251
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,840
as well as

252
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,160
a strong willpower.

253
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,600
Rest assured,

254
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,240
he will recover gradually.

255
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,680
Good.

256
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,720
Let's step outside for now.

257
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,040
Let him rest.

258
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,000
With Chen Hao's

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,240
current condition,

260
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,960
staying here isn't a long-term solution,

261
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,280
especially when all major hospitals

262
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,680
probably have received the arrest warrant.

263
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
After a few days' rest,

264
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
we'll need to move him

265
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,480
to a safer place

266
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,040
with better medical facilities.

267
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,280
Ideally,

268
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,920
I wouldn't want

269
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,080
to trouble you further,

270
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
but I'm stretched thin as it is,

271
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
so I must ask for your help.

272
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,680
Understood.

273
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,120
I have connections with the NSO.

274
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,840
I can ask them for assistance.

275
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,520
I heard about your efforts

276
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,240
to rescue Mr. Peng,

277
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,280
but

278
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,600
what exactly happened

279
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
that led to Mr. Chen getting shot?

280
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,040
Recent events are linked

281
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,360
to a military supplies smuggling case

282
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
Mr. Peng uncovered.

283
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,240
[After rescuing Mr. Peng,]

284
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,520
[we decided to follow]

[and found out that on the 6th of this month,]

[more cargo]

289
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,880
[would be shipped]

[to Shiliupu Wharf]

[on the Shinei Maru ship.]

[two critical pieces of evidence:]

[and the Public Security Bureau,]

300
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,480
[and a cargo manifest]

301

[listing the]

[seller's details,]

303
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,320
which will be

304
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,120
handed to Feng Guangyun

305
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,400
once the goods arrive at the dock.

306
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,200
Feng of the Criminal Investigation Dept.

307
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,280
at Shiliupu Police Station?

308
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,160
Yes.

309
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,840
Did you see

310
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
who was the seller on the manifest?

311
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
It could be a company,

312
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
or it might be my brother.

313
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,560
You two

314
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,440
take a break outside.

315
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,160
I need to

316
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,600
change Mr. Chen's dressing.

317
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,920
Ms. Shi,

318
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,400
could you come in and help me?

319
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,240
You stay here.

320
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,320
I'll go check

321
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,840
if anyone is following us.

322
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,960
Mrs. Ji,

323
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,520
is there something

324
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,600
you need to tell me alone?

325
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,600
Not all the

326
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
bullet fragments were removed.

327
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,760
There are still remnants in his lung.

328
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,440
If I arrange for him

329
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,560
to go to a hospital now,

330
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,240
can they be removed?

331
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,760
It's hard.

332
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,160
Even with first-rate surgical conditions

333
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,120
and

334
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,840
ample blood transfusions,

335
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,920
the risks are high.

336
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,280
Moreover,

337
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,480
he can't go to a hospital right now.

338
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,880
This gunshot wound

339
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
will definitely

340
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,520
cause irreversible damage.

341
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,720
What kind of damage?

342
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,160
The through-and-through wound

343
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,320
will manage to heal.

344
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,640
Formation of continuous

345
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,200
scar tissue is inevitable.

346
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,920
Many complications

347
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,200
will accompany him

348
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
for the rest of his life.

349
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,320
Chen Hao.

350
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,520
Chen Hao,

351
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,280
are you awake?

352
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Ms. Shi.

353
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,920
[Hold on,]

354
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,400
[I'll get you...]

355
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,920
Wait.

356
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
Sorry,

357
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,800
my undercover mission at the station...

358
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,560
This is Mrs. Ji,

359
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,440
a friend of mine.

360
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,720
She performed the surgery on you.

361
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
She's also one of us.

362
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
Thank you, Mrs. Ji.

363
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,920
Sorry,

364
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,440
my undercover mission at the station

365
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,480
failed.

366
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,560
But I didn't expose the organization

367
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
or my identity.

368
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,120
You should be safe.

369
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,920
Don't think too much.

370
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,520
Staying alive

371
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,840
gives us a chance to win.

372
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,320
Um.

373
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,440
Exactly,

374
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,560
staying alive is winning.

375
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,720
You need to recover quickly.

376
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,480
I'm still waiting for you

377
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,680
to come back to my French class.

378
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
Alright.

379
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,280
And,

380
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,640
Xiang Yuansheng has volunteered.

381
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,080
He said seriously

382
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,480
that he wanna

383
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,400
join Mr. Deng's team.

384
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,680
OK.

385
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
I see.

386
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll report it to the higher-ups.

387
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,120
[I'll tell the organization]

388
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,400
[that Xiang Yuansheng]

389
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,960
[has passed No. 037's assessment.]

390
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Don't worry.

391
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,760
I won't let him

392
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,000
risk it on his own.

393
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,680
Don't tell them

394
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,560
I still have shrapnel

395
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,520
in my body.

396
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,480
OK.

397
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Mr. Chen is awake.

398
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,280
Captain.

399
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,760
Miss Luo,

400
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
you have to change

401
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,080
your crying habit.

402
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,680
Have you slept enough?

403
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,440
Finally.

404
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,200
I told you I can make it.

405
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Mrs. Ji said the surgery was a success.

406
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Soon, I will be able to run.

407
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
Don't think about that.

408
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,160
Have a good rest.

409
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,960
The clues you found in Wusong Port...

410
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,080
No worries.

411
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,840
I'll keep digging

412
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
[until I find all the evidence.]

413
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,760
It's the only thing

414
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,080
I want to do.

415
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,240
The wanted notice

416
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,800
can be seen throughout Shanghai.

417
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,400
He's safer

418
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,320
here.

419
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,960
I'll bring you something

420
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
to eat and use soon.

421
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,440
Ms. Shi,

422
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,640
there's something

423
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
I should have told you

424
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,160
before I left Shanghai

425
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,080
last time.

426
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,000
What is it?

427
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,760
About Zhang Runjin.

428
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,440
2 months ago,

429
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,120
he died.

430
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,080
When I was

431
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:30,920
locked up

432
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,520
in the Shanghai Garrison Command,

433
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,360
Wei Daiqing told me

434
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
that Mr. Zhang was killed due to

435
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,200
his identity as a

436
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,840
communist,

437
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,040
and he's buried in the wasteland

438
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,120
outside the Command.

439
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,720
Mr. Xiang.

440
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
Li Qiushi and I

441
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,040
were both

442
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,360
protected and helped by him.

443
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm sorry

444
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,000
about his death.

445
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,680
Although

446
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
it's been some time,

447
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,080
I think

448
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,840
I still need to tell you personally.

449
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,160
Actually,

450
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,640
after his disappearance,

451
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,440
I was mentally prepared.

452
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,840
Thank you for

453
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,560
telling me about it.

454
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,400
I've submitted to the organization

455
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
a plan to expose the smuggling case.

456
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,760
We should expect a response soon.

457
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,600
Feng Guangyun's manifest

458
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
and pass

459
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,080
are crucial evidence.

460
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,440
As long as they're available,

461
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,920
we can confirm their crime.

462
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,520
It's not easy to get them.

463
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,680
Luckily,

464
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
Feng Guangyun

465
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
is an impatient man.

466
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,720
The plan has two steps.

467
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,520
First, expose smuggling and treason

468
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,280
through newspapers.

469
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,520
Then, get the public opinion against him.

470
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,200
He must show his flaws.

471
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
But Mr. Peng

472
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,240
is on

473
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,640
Tan Shiyuan's blacklist.

474
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,960
It's hard for him

475
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,160
to report it.

476
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,560
A playwright in the Left Alliance

477
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,640
surnamed Xia

478
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,400
is close to us.

479
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,640
There's a fan meeting

480
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,040
at the Guotai Theatre.

481
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,200
Many reporters

482
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,080
will attend.

483
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,120
Mr. Xia said

484
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,320
he would do his best

485
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,560
if it's good for salvation.

486
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,440
[I think]

487
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
we can take

488
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,200
the advantage of the fan meeting.

489
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,320
I'll contact Mr. Peng.

490
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,520
No.

491
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,920
I'll contact him.

492
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,480
Your mission

493
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,120
in Shanghai

494
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,760
has been terminated

495
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,000
by the organization.

496
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,080
Wei Daiqing targeted the tailor shop.

497
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,120
Whatever the reason,

498
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,360
you can't stay here.

499
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,760
Here are some clothes,

500
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,280
and the ticket to Hong Kong

501
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
by a French cargo ship.

502
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,800
The most suitable one

503
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,160
I can get from the Council.

504
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,320
Here's your ID.

505
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Tao Lanxin.

506
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
I haven't

507
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,920
seen my name

508
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,120
in years.

509
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,680
I didn't expect this evacuation

510
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
to be so sudden.

511
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,360
It's discipline.

512
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,320
You must evacuate immediately.

513
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,120
There're only

514
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,080
3 people left in our group.

515
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,280
Chen Hao is injured.

516
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,760
I can't put you at risk.

517
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
You can't say that.

518
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,120
It's our mission.

519
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,240
Zhang Runjin's death

520
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,840
will not be in vain.

521
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
I believe

522
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,320
the revolution will soon see its light.

523
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,680
[Take care of ourselves.]

524
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
I don't know

525
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,360
when I'll see you again.

526
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,160
But we'll meet again.

527
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,080
I will be back.

528
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,960
Take care.

529
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,480
Xinyu,

530
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,040
you too.

531
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,200
When did she disappear?

532
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,440
It's almost

533
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,200
at 3 p.m...

534
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,560
How did she slip away?

535
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,840
Actually,

536
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,920
I've been

537
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,760
staring at her.

538
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,200
But I lost finally.

539
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,240
Has she

540
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,360
been to the phone booth?

541
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,440
No.

542
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,400
There's no phone inside,

543
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,840
who told her to go to the Store?

544
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,200
Did anyone come

545
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
before she disappeared?

546
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
Many have come,

547
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,840
including

548
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,720
Inspector Shi

549
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,680
from the Council.

550
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,160
She was here to tip her off.

551
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,480
We arrived at the Store at 4 p.m.

552
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,320
but she left here at 3 p.m.

553
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,560
The timing was just right.

554
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,400
Send people

555
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
to guard all the docks,

556
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,680
bus and railway stations.

557
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,000
Arrest her if she shows up.

558
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,360
[Xiang Yuansheng,]

559
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,120
[I heard you]

560
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,440
[confront Wei Daiqing]

561
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,400
[from inside.]

562
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,760
[Weren't]

563
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,640
[you afraid that he'd kill you?]

564
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,560
That was my only choice.

565
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
How brave!

566
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,640
Mrs. Ji and I

567
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,960
were stressed,

568
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,960
and afraid

569
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
something would happen.

570
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
You're brave too.

571
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,560
If both of you

572
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,280
haven't moved Chen Hao here,

573
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,520
it would be

574
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,360
useless for me

575
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,200
to buy more time.

576
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,440
You rest here

577
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,120
tonight.

578
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,520
I'll check on Chen Hao.

579
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I can take care of him

580
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,920
with you.

581
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,640
No need. Take a rest.

582
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,320
You didn't

583
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,560
[have a good rest today.]

584
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,840
I'll take

585
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,400
care of him tonight.

586
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,560
Tomorrow morning...

587
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,280
What are you doing?

588
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,160
What else can I do?

589
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,760
Sleep.

590
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,640
Aren't there any other rooms available?

591
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,720
No.

592
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,720
Drink some water.

593
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,640
No,

594
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,960
I can drink it myself.

595
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,120
Pay attention to the wound.

596
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,120
It's awkward.

597
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,760
You have no choice.

598
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
Get used to it.

599
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,080
How's your watch?

600
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,440
It sometimes runs fast

601
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
and sometimes slow.

602
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,480
Anyway,

603
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,960
it's never accurate.

604
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Give it back.

605
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,840
I saved up

606
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,680
half a year to buy it.

607
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,240
It's given to me,

608
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,280
you can't take it back.

609
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
I'll buy you a new one

610
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,120
when I get back to Nanjing.

611
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,680
OK.

612
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,840
That's a deal.

613
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,360
We said

614
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,720
we were a team.

615
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,280
As teammates,

616
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,560
you couldn't isolate me.

617
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,440
I didn't.

618
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,080
I'm taking care of Chen Hao.

619
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,000
As teammates,

620
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
we should act together.

621
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,320
Anyway,

622
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,400
I'll also

623
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,360
sleep here tonight.

624
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,320
Thank you for making my bed.

625
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,080
If you sleep here,

626
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
where will Xiang Yuansheng sleep?

627
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,840
Captain, you're awake.

628
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,400
Do you

629
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,440
feel better?

630
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,080
Yes.

631
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,720
Captain,

632
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,800
today,

633
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,520
Mrs. Ji and Ms. Shi

634
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,480
were amazing.

635
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,600
What did they do?

636
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
We're in a critical situation

637
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,680
at the Store.

638
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,680
However,

639
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,480
even so,

640
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,560
they made

641
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,840
the right decision

642
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,760
[to save]

643
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,080
[and transfer people.]

644
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,080
[They've always]

645
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,040
[been resolute,]

646
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,320
[without any panic.]

647
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:00,840
[Captain,]

648
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,200
[I learned]

649
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,640
that women can also

650
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,080
be so bold

651
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,080
and responsible.

652
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,800
Do you want

653
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
to be like them?

654
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,520
When I joined the Fourth Sation,

655
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,720
I just wanna be a police officer.

656
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,440
But

657
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,120
I've been

658
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,920
doing a lot of thinking.

659
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,920
Honestly, I like

660
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,960
to do

661
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,280
anything meaningful

662
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
with you.

663
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,320
Minmin,

664
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,720
maybe you're getting to

665
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,120
know yourself.

666
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,560
I think so, too.

667
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,280
[Do you want to be like]

668
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Ms. Shi

669
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,560
and Mrs. Ji?

670
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,080
Of course.

671
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,440

672

673

from now on,

675
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,400
will I have a chance

676
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,080
to be like them?

677
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,840
Definitely.

678
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,840
As you wish.

679
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,480
I'll work hard.

680
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,680
Good.

[Don't move.]

Show your ID.

686
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,240
Hurry up.

687
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,920
I want one.

688
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,640
How about this?

[I have something to show you.]

[This is the wedding dress]

[I made for you.]

[It's not finished.]

[For me?]

[I'm not busy lately.]

[Almost taken shape.]

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,760
[had just graduated]

707
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,960
[from radio in Moscow.]

708
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,600
[You didn't bring any drawings]

709
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,760
[or parts.]

710
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,040
[You said everything]

711
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,680
[was in your head.]

712
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,840
[You barely say anything]

713
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,080
[except for those related to telegrams.]

714
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,360
[I am the same now.]

715
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,080
[But I enjoy talking to you.]

716
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,400
[Here's something]

717
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,520
[to eat and use.]

718
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,400
[That will last you]

719
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,320
[three or four days.]

720
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,720
[Remember to burn]

721
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,960
[the dirty clothes]

722
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,320
[to avoid trouble.]

723
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,960
[I've got a car for you]

724
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,080
for precaution.

725
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,840
Here's the medicine.

726
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,640
How do you feel?

727
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,000
Much better.

728
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,600
I feel like

729
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,000
I can walk.

730
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,720
Please take care of him.

731
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,000
Don't let him go around.

732
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
[Don't worry.]

733
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,760
We knew it.

734
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,480
[Besides,]

735
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,520
some news about the smuggling case.

736
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,440
We're making progress.

737
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,480
Mr. Peng

738
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,760
went to the Guotai Theatre.

739
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,560
At a fan meeting,

740
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,480
he spoke to reporters

741
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
about what happened

742
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,760
to him

743
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,160
and the investigation.

744
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,200
I believe

745
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,560
that Feng Guangyun and Tan Shiyuan

746
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,360
will be pushed to the forefront.

747
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,480
Their crimes

748
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
will be exposed finally.

749
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,280
What we need most now

750
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,680
is concrete evidence.

751
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,520
[Feng Guanyun]

752
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,120
[is an impatient man.]

753
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,320
As long as he panics,

754
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,680
we have a chance.

755
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,600
And,

756
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,680
Mrs. Ji

757
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,280
was arrested by Wei Daiqing.

758
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,400
Take care of yourselves.
