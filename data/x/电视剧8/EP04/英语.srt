00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,120
Shooting Stars EP04

3
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,760
Come in.

4
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,400
Captain.

5
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,080
We've applied

6
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,160
to view the records of Family Hua.

7
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,000
But failed.

8
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,480
The Party Investigation Dept. refused.

9
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,400
Exactly.

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
They don't care us.

11
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,080
In private,

12
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,320
I only get the message that

13
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
the second son of Family Hua called Hua Zhen

14
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,680
arrived in Shanghai and visited his friend

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
the 3rd day when Deng Mingyuan had been arrested.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
Is Hua Zhen in Shanghai?

17
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
It is said so.

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,360
When will he go back to Nanjing?

19
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,320
I heard that he hadn't been back yet.

20
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,840
He just got home from Jiangyin,

21
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
and soon went to Shanghai.

22
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
And right on the 3rd day

23
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,400
when I arrested Deng Mingyuan.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,600
On the day I arrested Deng Mingyuan,

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
it seemed that Hua Zhen

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,640
was the one who talked to him

27
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,680
in the room.

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
His father Hua Zhuoqin

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,000
attended

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Army University in Baoding

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,360
and then studied abroad in Japan's Zhen Wu School.

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,640
He was the classmate of the Chairman Jiang.

33
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,360
He is the undersecretary of Military Affairs Department now.

34
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,400
Hua Zhen's elder brother called Hua Liang.

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,360
In 1923,

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
he joined the soldier company of teaching battalion.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,640
In 1924,

38
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,400
he was admitted to Whampoa Military Academy.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Hua Zhen,

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,040
in 1931,

41
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
was admitted to the Class Zhengze

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,080
in Army University.

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,200
He is the best student in subjects like

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,040
armament science, physics and foreign language.

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,000
In 1935,

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,480
he was chosen to be the second-year student

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,160
of navigation science major in the S.M.C.

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,560
You're a nice drawer.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
The scale here

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,080
is still a little off.

51
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,600
What's its name?

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Yet Sen Cruiser

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,480
and Gunboat.

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,320
What's this

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
used for?

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,640
What do you think?

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
I think you must have partners

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,080
in Shanghai.

59
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,800
We're done

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,080
talking about it today.

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,560
Let's change a topic

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
this time.

63
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,760
I heard that

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,520
Hua Zhen,

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,600
the second son of Undersecretary Hua of Military Affairs Department,

66
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,520
has been calling you teacher.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,640
I've invested that

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,880
the relationship between you two

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
is not very close.

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,040
You didn't receive the invitation

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
of Family Hua at all.

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
It's a lie

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,040
that congratulating the Undersecretary Hua

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
on his birthday.

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
You want to escape

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,800
or you think

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
someone in that house

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,520
can help you escape.

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,280
Who is that person?

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Why don't you ask Undersecretary Hua?

81
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,920
I will.

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,240
Since you had been in Hua's house,

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
I'll certainly investigate Family Hua.

84
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,040
Captain Wei,

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
I want to change the topic, too.

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,320
A friend of mine

87
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,080
had been in

88
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
the military unit of investigation section

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,360
in Nanchang Police Department.

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,080
He had said that

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,240
if the Nanchang Airport hadn't a fire

92
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,880
and the investigation section hadn't been dissolved,

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,360
one of the Majors

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
would be

95
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,160
a Lieutenant Colonel now.

96
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,040
Isn't Wei Fulai,

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
your former name?

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
Captain Wei.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
What're you talking about?

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,760
I don't understand.

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,480
Wei Daiqing.

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
You had made a good name

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,760
for yourself.

104
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,360
You even want to investigate the Undersecretary of Military Affairs Department.

105
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
Does the Garrison Command

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
know your wild ambition?

107
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
This is not ambition.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
It's the responsibility

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
of a soldier.

110
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,600
But a traitor like you

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,040
will never understand.

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Prepare more charcoal pencils for Mr. Deng.

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,840
He will stay here

114
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,200
for a longer time.

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,960
Miss Luo,

116
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
how is your first day at work?

117
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Perfect.

118
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
The neighbors

119
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,520
will ask you for help

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,600
in the future.

121
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,520
No problem.

122
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,200
Brother.

123
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,080
What happened?

124
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,600
The punks came again.

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
They said brother didn't settle the interests,

126
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,360
and ruined our dinner.

127
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,000
Let me.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,720
I can do this.

129
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,520
Let me.

130
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,440
Sorry, Minmin.

131
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,960
I can't offer you a dinner

132
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,880
after your first day home

133
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
as a police officer from work.

134
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,960
Brother,

135
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm the police now.

136
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,040
If they came again,

137
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
I'll report to the Fourth Station House.

138
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,280
My colleagues take good care of me.

139
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,360
We'll all come to

140
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,520
our photo shop together

141
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
in our police uniforms.

142
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,280
We'll see who dares

143
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,400
to make trouble here again.

144
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,200
I'll find some food

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
in the kitchen.

146
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,720
Don't use your hand.

147
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,360
Sister,

148
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,160
you've polished it for half an hour.

149
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,080
What do you want to do?

150
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,640
Leave me alone.

151
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm cleaning my own clothes.

152
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,760
It's new.

153
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
And you clean too much.

154
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,960
Do your homework.

155
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,160
Sister,

156
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,960
I wonder

157
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,600
why you're obsessed with

158
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,760
being the police?

159
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,600
Our captain said

160
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,840
upholding the justice and protecting people.

161
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
Do you want to

162
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,960
scare away the punks

163
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,320
who bully brother?

164
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,600
Do you think

165
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm a naive primary school student

166
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,960
like you?

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Will you

168
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,440
hang it before the door

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,600
and tell everyone.

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,240
Maybe it works.

171
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,960
Go to finish your homework.

172
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,720
You said that your colleagues

173
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
will help us.

174
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,880
Are they saying that just for comforting

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
father and brother?

176
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,720
They aren't.

177
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,360
They all take care of me,

178
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,480
and they're willing to help me.

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,960
Won't you be dismissed

180
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,200
after a few days?

181
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,960
No way.

182
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
How could they dismiss me?

183
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm the only policewoman in the Fourth Station House.

184
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,360
They all like me.

185
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
You are in charge of serving water,

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
welcoming people and seeing them off.

187
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,720
Going out is a waste of food.

188
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,360
I heard that every policeman

189
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
has a partner.

190
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
Do you have one?

191
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,800
Sure.

192
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,960
You're always in the last place.

193
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,360
Does your partner despise you?

194
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,720
Despise me?

195
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,080
He appreciates me very much.

196
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,200
And we make

197
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
a perfect match.

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
You're lying.

199
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,200
If possible,

200
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,680
I advise you

201
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,960
to change a partner.

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
This is for you.

203
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,720
I've said that

204
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,200
it matches me.

205
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,080
That's because I'm a policewoman now.

206
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,960
And I don't have chance to wear it.

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,480
Thank you, sister.

208
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,360
From the alarm service record,

209
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,320
the captain called Chen Hao

210
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
happened to appear

211
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
when arresting the criminal.

212
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
But when I was talking to him today,

213
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,960
I found that he was

214
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,120
adverse to me as a policeman here.

215
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
So,

216
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,320
maybe he had done something illegal

217
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,720
and was afraid of being found out.

218
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,800
Maybe it's just an excuse

219
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,120
of catching the suspect in the abduction case

220
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,560
in Van Hwa Hotel.

221
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,600
It's worth mentioning that

222
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,840
the case involved in your parents

223
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,600
had been filing by the Fourth Station House.

224
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
And the witness is the suspect being investigated.

225
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,960
I've been the right place.

226
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,000
Brother Yuansheng,

227
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,600
thank you for buying clothes for me.

228
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,840
It seemed that the clothes I bought

229
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,200
didn't fit.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
It doesn't matter.

231
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,320
I'm shorter than my peers.

232
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,000
Just hang in there a little longer.

233
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,440
If it goes well,

234
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,240
the case will be clear

235
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,480
within a month.

236
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
At that time,

237
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,720
you don't need to hide.

238
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,440
And I'll leave

239
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,600
the mixed place.

240
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,840
Excuse me, Mr. Bai,

241
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,040
is there a break room

242
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,840
for a policewoman?

243
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,240
We don't have policewoman.

244
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, you are.

245
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,960
Let me explain,

246
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,640
if we don't pay you salary

247
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,000
this month,

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,360
we'll arrange a break room for you.

249
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,040
Do you choose salary

250
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,120
or a break room?

251
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,000
The salary.

252
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,080
OK.

253
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,760
Good morning.

254
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,360
Good morning.

255
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
Mr. Xiang, Miss Luo

256
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,240
Good morning.

257
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,720
Don't you buy daily outfit

258
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,360
the captain asked?

259
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,600
No.

260
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,320
I brought some from home.

261
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,960
Did you buy?

262
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,880
I bought some.

263
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,480
Tell me if you need.

264
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,480
OK.

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,720
What's the matter?

266
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,840
She's a girl.

267
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,360
You get off clothes before her.

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,720
It's impolite.

269
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
I have not noticed.

270
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,320
I have not noticed.

271
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,840
Yuansheng,

272
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,080
you have a nice watch.

273
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,200
Does your family run a business?

274
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,320
No.

275
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,840
Don't be shy about it.

276
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,800
My father is

277
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,600
the boss of Hong Fa restaurant.

278
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,080
My uncle is the sworn brother

279
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,600
of director Wang in the 5th district.

280
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,960
We have real estate

281
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,560
to charge rents in the south of the city.

282
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,960
I should keep it a secret

283
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,120
for my family.

284
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,320
But I don't care.

285
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
So, you don't be nervous.

286
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,000
Well,

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,480
I didn't choose you

288
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,000
as a partner yesterday.

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
I hope you won't be angry.

290
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,040
Because I can only

291
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,560
choose one partner after all.

292
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,080
Right?

293
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,600
If I have another chance,

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
I can apply to the captain

295
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,200
for being the partner of you.

296
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
No,

297
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
thanks.

298
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,000
I understand that

299
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,840
you don't want to choose Miss Luo to be your partner.

300
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,360
Right?

301
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,600
I don't care who's my partner.

302
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,680
And I didn't expect working here

303
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
needs a partner.

304
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
He must think

305
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,120
he's not good enough for me.

306
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,040
Everyone,

307
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,840
look at Ronghua.

308
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,560
Who can be

309
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
as approachable like him?

310
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
He's a senior policeman,

311
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,920
but still serving us water.

312
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
Zhang,

313
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't agree with you.

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,840
Brother Zuo is a real man

315
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,720
who knows when to be flexible and when to stand firm.

316
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,240
He had witnessed all manner of things

317
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
on the battlefield before.

318
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Isn't it, Zuo?

319
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,360
Zuo,

320
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,800
the comrades in arms of you

321
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,840
have been officers

322
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,160
and directors.

323
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,480
Directors?

324
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,600
If we can't solve the case,

325
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,560
all of us can go home.

326
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I've just received the call from the Police Department.

327
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,640
They asked the murder case

328
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,960
in Van Hwa Hotel.

329
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,160
Was the case filed

330
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,600
in the Forth Station House?

331
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,720
Yes.

332
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,760
Because the case happened in our administrative area,

333
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,480
so, it was filed in the Forth Station House.

334
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
How is the case going?

335
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,720
I

336
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,120
am urging them

337
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
to overcome difficulties.

338
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
So, we don't have any clues, right?

339
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,960
How about other police stations?

340
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,360
Was there any information from residents?

341
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,080
Mr. Feng,

342
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,000
the Second Station House

343
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,080
doesn't have information.

344
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,360
Can I make a statement in this circumstance?

345
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,960
Do you have clues?

346
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,720
It seems that I won't let you talk.

347
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Speak your mind and use your own judgment.

348
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,200
Mr. Feng,

349
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,800
I've investigated the background of the Mr. and Mrs. Meng.

350
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,600
They had a daughter indeed,

351
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,080
whose name is Meng Duoci.

352
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,000
I'd checked

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
the clothes of her

354
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,480
which were the same as the clothes in crime scene.

355
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,040
The clothes

356
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,960
have similar size.

357
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,600
And 3 of them

358
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,840
are the same brand.

359
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
I'd asked the Nanyang Model Private School

360
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,440
she attended.

361
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,320
The time of her truancy is the same as

362
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,480
the check-in time

363
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
in Van Hwa Hotel.

364
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
So, I suppose that

365
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
Meng Duoci lived in

366
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
the same room with her parents.

367
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,280
And she probably

368
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,120
was the witness.

369
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
Why didn't you report

370
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,680
such an important clue

371
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,240
to Mr. Feng earlier?

372
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,760
Continue.

373
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,640
There had a murder case 2 months before,

374
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,800
in which the victim's throat

375
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
was cut, too.

376
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,640
The conditions

377
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,880
were similar to

378
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,760
the case in Van Hwa Hotel.

379
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,200
So, I doubt that

380
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,520
the murderer is the same.

381
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,360
I think it is

382
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,080
the key to investigation.

383
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,640
Didn't you learn about the condition

384
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,600
before investigating the case?

385
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
The murderer of the former case

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,400
had already been executed by shooting.

387
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,280
Really?

388
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
Or, wait for you?

389
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,080
The Police Department attaches importance to the case,

390
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,520
because the victim was renowned before

391
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,520
after all.

392
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,080
The Fourth Station House,

393
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,920
prepare the materials

394
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,800
and hand the case over to the Shiliupu Police Station.

395
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,760
Yes, Chief.

396
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,000
Over.

397
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,560
Zuo.

398
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,760
Yes.

399
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,520
Do the new officers of the Fourth Station House

400
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,360
work hard?

401
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,840
Yes.

402
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,320
They worked very hard.

403
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,840
I felt sorry since

404
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,360
you were given the bottom of them.

405
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,160
Don't talk like that.

406
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,320
I'm not a

407
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,600
picky person.

408
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,120
I won't trouble the leaders.

409
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,920
That's good.

410
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,600
Then, train them carefully.

411
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,120
Yes.

412
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,160
The Police Department will shut down a bunch of

413
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,400
useless police stations at the end of the year.

414
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,440
Pay attention to this.

415
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
And tomorrow morning,

416
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,960
show me all

417
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,280
the materials related to the murder case

418
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,160
in Van Hwa Hotel.

419
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,240
OK.

420
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,600
I've attended so many meetings

421
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,040
and every time I don't have a seat

422
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,360
while others

423
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,600
always have.

424
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
I'll bring a chair next time.

425
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,080
Is the chair the key point?

426
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,560
I'm worrying about the future of the Fourth Station.

427
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,120
I didn't feel your concern.

428
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,040
The murder case in Van Hwa Hotel

429
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,520
will be handed over to the Shiliupu Police Station.

430
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,880
It's an important case.

431
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,640
Both the Shiliupu Police Station and the Police Department

432
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,120
are attaching importance to it.

433
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,880
Mr. Feng

434
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,000
will investigate the case in person.

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,040
From now on,

436
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
the case has nothing to do

437
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
with us.

438
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
The materials and clues

439
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,760
will be handed over to Mr. Feng myself.

440
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,320
However, we have another task.

441
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,040
From now on,

442
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
the case of abduction

443
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,360
is the key task of us.

444
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Everyone should work hard.

445
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,280
You get me?

446
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,120
Got you.

447
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,240
We have a new clue

448
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
about the abduction case.

449
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,680
There is a suspect

450
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,720
of the abduction case

451
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,440
number 013.

452
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,880
He frequently appears

453
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,440
in the Fenghuang Dance Hall.

454
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,000
The dance hall is located in

455
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,560
the border

456
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,080
between us and French Concession.

457
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
The suspect possibly

458
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
hides in the French Concession.

459
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,200
Because he knows

460
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,400
that we can't catch him

461
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,560
without right.

462
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,320
He exactly knows that

463
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,760
he can escape the law

464
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,640
in French Concession.

465
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,080
So, people who violate the law

466
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
will flee to the French Concession.

467
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
And we must arrest him

468
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
before he

469
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,640
crosses the border.

470
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,280
Captain,

471
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,680
what if he crosses the border?

472
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,160
Then we can't catch him.

473
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,440
If the French are angry in Police Service,

474
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,320
none of us will be better off.

475
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,360
Try our best and we can do that.

476
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,160
Everyone puts on the daily clothes

477
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,320
and carries the identification of police.

478
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,640
Someone must stay here.

479
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
Xiang Yuansheng, you stay here.

480
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,160
I don't agree.

481
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
Why?

482
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,520
I came here by all manner of means

483
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,640
to catch the suspect.

484
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,840
And this case provides me a good chance.

485
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I must go with you.

486
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,920
Who do you think you're?

487
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,840
Do you know

488
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,160
how sly the suspect is?

489
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,760
We've made efforts and

490
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,640
tried for half a month

491
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,680
without catching a suspect.

492
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,040
How could you catch him?

493
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,000
I can catch him

494
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,320
as long as he is there.

495
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,360
Bai.

496
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,080
You mean that

497
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,920
you'll catch him if you go with us?

498
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,120
OK.

499
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,240
I believe you this time.

500
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,280
But I have to say

501
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,440
in advance.

502
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,640
If you can't catch him,

503
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,680
you won't

504
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,120
have another chance

505
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,160
no matter who you can rely on.

506
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,920
You get me?

507
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,400
Anyone else

508
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,160
has any ideas?

509
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,160
If you don't have,

510
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,080
I'll make arrangements.

511
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,440
When we arrive at the Fenghuang Dance Hall,

512
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,840
Bai keeps the main entrance of the hall,

513
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,920
and puts on the clothes of rickshaw driver.

514
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Dongbao and Hongfa,

515
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,120
do you prepare the daily clothes?

516
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,280
Yes.

517
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,400
I've prepared 4,

518
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,840
and I can play many roles.

519
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,680
Only need one.

520
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,160
OK.

521
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,040
Bai is the leader.

522
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,800
Minmin,

523
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
you are in a group with Xiang Yuansheng.

524
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,560
You are the leader

525
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,360
of the group.

526
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,080
Yes.

527
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,840
This is the first cooperation of us.

528
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,600
We should collaborate with each other

529
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
without causing trouble.

530
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,400
You get me?

531
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,160
Got you.

532
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,800
Change clothes now.

533
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,960
Do you have any idea

534
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
about what to wear?

535
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,440
Of course the clothes make me cool.

536
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,040
Mr. Xiang.

537
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,640
Mr. Xiang.

538
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
What're you doing here without changing clothes?

539
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
So, I'll change first.

540
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,120
The captain

541
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,880
is waiting for us.

542
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,360
You.

543
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,560
Thank you.

544
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,560
Thank you.

545
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,920
Who does she thank to?

546
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,360
I don't know.

547
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,800
Whoever.

548
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,840
Change the clothes.

549
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,160
Mr. Xiang,

550
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,840
don't you think

551
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,600
it's too exaggerating to wear the suit?

552
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't have any other clothes.

553
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,160
You should buy some

554
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,800
if you don't have.

555
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,680
Miss Luo,

556
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,760
do you have a boyfriend?

557
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,040
Will you like a boyfriend

558
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,320
like Mr. Xiang?

559
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,560
No.

560
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,240
He has no compassion.

561
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,400
What about me?

562
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm compassionate.

563
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,560
This is the first action of us

564
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,400
with wearing daily clothes.

565
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,080
Everyone gets ready.

566
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,680
Be relaxed

567
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,400
in case of identity disclosure.

568
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,040
Move.

569
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,640
Yes.

570
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,280
Hurry.

571
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,400
Then I won't prepare the food.

572
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,320
Take care of yourself.

573
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,560
They're carrying out the task

574
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,320
while we three are left.

575
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,640
Enjoy our leisure,

576
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,920
right?

577
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,000
Drink up.

578
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,560
A roasted sweet potato, please.

579
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,160
Here you're.

580
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,840
OK.

581
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,080
Mr. Xiang,

582
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,240
Let's change another place.

583
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,360
It costs too much.

584
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,080
We're here to carry out the task.

585
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,160
And this is the best observation point.

586
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,800
Wait me for a moment.

587
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,360
Good morning, lady.

588
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,920
Good morning.

589
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,560
I would like a cup of coffee.

590
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
OK, wait a minute.

591
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,280
I only order a cup of coffee.

592
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,040
You can have a drink.

593
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
I don't like its taste.

594
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,560
Don't worry about the money.

595
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,360
Although it costs much.

596
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm the leader of the group.

597
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,440
So, I'll bear the cost.

598
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,760
Well.

599
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,560
Chen Hao told me that

600
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,440
we have a budget.

601
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,560
Pardon?

602
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,720
It's weird that

603
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
you drink nothing and just sit here.

604
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,880
We have to spend the money

605
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,840
to pretend our identities.

606
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,800
And,

607
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,320
you look very nervous,

608
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
which makes us unnatural.

609
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,600
Am I?

610
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,000
If you don't like coffee,

611
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,320
you can take a cake.

612
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,120
That's what we should do

613
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,320
in the cafe.

614
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,600
A cake of chocolate or fruits?

615
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,840
Chocolate.

616
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,080
Is here the right place?

617
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,680
Yes.

618
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,200
I've investigated that

619
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
he had a business in this dance hall.

620
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,840
Move.

621
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,000
Sun Hongfa, he isn't the suspect.

622
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,840
They moved.

623
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,440
Remain seated.

624
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,760
Miss Luo

625
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,760
You catch the wrong person.

626
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
What's wrong with you?

627
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,760
The member of them

628
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,560
is fewer and fewer.

629
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm so sorry.

630
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,840
Will you do it well?

631
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,400
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,920
You'll give me two days.

633
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,520
I'll make you satisfied.

634
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,280
Hurry up.

635
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,040
I will.

636
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,000
Sanyou.

637
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,720
See that?

638
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,880
This is the criterion.

639
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,600
OK.

640
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,320
Hurry up.

641
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,680
Got you.

642
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,480
Get out of the way.

643
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,040
Get out of the way.

644
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,840
Get out of the way.

645
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,000
That's him.

646
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,040
Wait.

647
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Chen Hao.

648
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,560
Why are the policemen of the Fourth Station House all here?

649
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,640
Follow them.

650
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,160
Stop.

651
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,000
Don't run.

652
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,920
Are you an octopus?

653
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
You hold me so tightly.

654
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,440
Are you a real policeman?

655
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,040
Shut up.

656
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,640
You aren't a real policeman.

657
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,680
You're so rude.

658
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,840
I've been shouting from behind

659
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,280
but couldn't get through to you guys.

660
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,840
After all this hustle, only catch a petty thief.

661
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,520
What?

662
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,440
Isn't he the suspect of the abduction case?

663
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,840
I'm not.

664
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,800
You're a thief anyway.

665
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,840
He rammed a person.

666
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,360
Get out of the way.

667
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,080
Get out of the way.

668
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,680
Xiang Yuansheng.

669
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,960
The front is the French Concession.

670
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,080
Xiang Yuansheng.

671
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,800
We police don't have right

672
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,040
to catch suspects there.

673
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
It's okay if I'm not a policeman, right?

674
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,200
Xiang Yuansheng.

675
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
Are you crazy, Xiang Yuansheng?

676
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,040
Xiang Yuansheng.

677
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,360
Don't come over.

678
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,360
Are you okay?

679
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,360
Xiang Yuansheng.

680
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,640
They're catching the suspect.

681
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,440
Don't come over.

682
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,920
Don't come over.

683
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,760
Xiang Yuansheng.

684
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,240
Get out of here.

685
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,360
Get out of here, Xiang Yuansheng.

686
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,320
Get out of here.

687
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,080
Get out of here.

688
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,280
Get out of here.

689
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,280
Get out of here, Xiang Yuansheng.

690
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,800
Go back.

691
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
Take him out.

692
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,360
Get out of here, Xiang Yuansheng.

693
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,920
Hurry.

694
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,640
Get out of here.

695
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,440
Hurry up.

696
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,480
Hurry up.

697
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,040
Hurry up.

698
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Hurry up out.

699
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,360
Hurry up.

700
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,360
Help.

701
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,360
You are the policeman of China.

702
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,960
I'm not a policeman.

703
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,840
Sorry.

704
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,920
He's my team member.

705
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,240
I'm the supervisor of the Police Service

706
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,040
from Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council.

707
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,800
Who are you?

708
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,480
Nice to meet you.

709
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,640
I'm Chen Hao, the captain policeman of

710
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,960
the Fourth Station House

711
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
of Shiliupu Police Station in Shanghai.

712
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,240
How could your member arrest a suspect

713
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,440
without our permission?

714
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,400
Don't you know

715
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,760
Chinese police

716
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,840
haven't right to arrest suspects here?

717
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,760
I'm not.

718
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,280
Sorry.

719
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,000
He's a police cadet.

720
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,440
And he knows little.

721
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,840
You can't bring the suspect back.

722
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,440
What's more,

723
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,440
that policeman has to go

724
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,520
with me.

725
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,440
It's impossible.

726
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,040
Captain Chen.

727
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
This is the regulation here.

728
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,200
I know the regulations.

729
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,880
But I can't leave him here

730
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,360
because of

731
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,520
the nonsense rules.

732
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,520
You have the right to

733
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,800
file a complaint to the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council.

734
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,520
Take him away.

735
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,920
Don't move.

736
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,840
I need to file a complaint now.

737
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,800
This road isn't in French Concession.

738
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,360
It is.

739
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,320
We caught the suspect

740
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,000
here.

741
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,040
Watch it clearly.

742
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,040
And there is French Concession.

743
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,880
The entrance door is under renovating.

744
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,440
The road won't belong to the French Concession

745
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,200
until the

746
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,160
renovation is finished.

747
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,880
Moreover,

748
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,640
we're in the territory of China now.

749
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,320
If you take him,

750
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,120
you'll violate the regulations.

751
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,360
Last month,

752
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,040
Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council

753
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,760
had signed an agreement

754
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
with Shanghai Municipal Government.

755
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,720
This road belongs to French Concession now.

756
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,040
It never belongs to

757
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,280
French Concession.

758
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,640
Captain Chen,

759
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,880
you're against the rules.

760
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,360
What are you doing?

761
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,200
The suspect had abducted

762
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,280
4 girls.

763
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,720
Mind your own job.

764
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,680
A murder case happened

765
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,000
in Van Hwa Hotel,

766
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,320
which is your administrative area.

767
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,360
Have you arrested him?

768
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Mr. Meng is the excellent taxpayer

769
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,760
in French Concession.

770
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,400
You'll soon receive the complaints hotline

771
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,440
from Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council.

772
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,000
Wait.

773
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,960
I buy all your scallion cakes.

774
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,680
OK.

775
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,840
Captain Chen,

776
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,160
please apply to me

777
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,520
for the permission

778
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,480
even if you just want to buy a scallion cake.

779
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,160
Let's go.

780
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,760
You also know it is a concession.

781
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,240
You'll return the place

782
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,360
one day.

783
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,240
OK, thank you.

784
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,200
Let's go back.

785
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,280
Let's go back.

786
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:41,840
Go.

787
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,520
Mr. Xiang is agile.

788
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,920
You arrest the suspect with a punch.

789
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,000
If I were him,

790
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,480
I can't stand up.

791
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,120
Is it true that Mr. Xiang

792
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,840
failed the entrance exam of police

793
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,360
so that he got in by relationship?

794
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,160
It can't be true.

795
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,720
Mr. Xiang has cat-like reflexes.

796
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,880
Why does it become tighter

797
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,240
as I pull it?

798
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,800
Let me see.

799
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,800
Sorry, sorry.

800
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,720
It hurts.

801
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,720
It's tighter indeed.

802
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,640
It really hurts.

803
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,720
I've seen this

804
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,560
on the newspaper.

805
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,240
It's called

806
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,960
sailors' knot.

807
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,400
Only naval sailors can do this.

808
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,240
How could he

809
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,640
have something to do

810
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,720
with the navy?

811
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,800
I know that

812
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,720
villagers use knots like this

813
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,640
to tight the pigs.

814
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,680
Enough.

815
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,200
Though I haven't seen this before,

816
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,520
I have my own judgment.

817
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,240
What's your opinion?

818
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,280
I know.

819
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,720
What?

820
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,440
He's right.

821
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,480
Oh, come on.

822
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,600
I'll handle the problem

823
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,920
before I leave the station.

824
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,800
You can tell other policemen that

825
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,200
they won't be involved.

826
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,040
Be a policeman as you like.

827
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,360
Give up being as you don't like.

828
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,960
Doesn't the word POLICE

829
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,360
mean anything to you?

830
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,720
You are not wanting to be policeman

831
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,840
sincerely.

832
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,920
What are you really up to?

833
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,000
First, you say you're in Shanghai to take in the sights,

834
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,600
and then suddenly,

835
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,000
you're talking about becoming a policeman to win honour.

836
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,480
Who sent you here?

837
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,960
Why can you be a policeman in the Fourth Station House?

838
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
What happened, Captain?

839
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,200
Car ramming again.

840
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,960
Answer my question.

841
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,240
No one sent me.

842
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,520
It is a break of being a policeman.

843
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,800
I won't stay here

844
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,760
so long.

845
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,640
You are a member of us

846
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
before you leave.

847
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,560
You're going to

848
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,280
hurt everyone here

849
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,840
with your rampage.

850
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
Although the Fourth Station House isn't big,

851
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,000
we have own regulations.

852
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,440
You've said that

853
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,360
the principle of being a policeman

854
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,640
is upholding the justice

855
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,680
and protecting people when I firstly arrived here.

856
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,640
Yes.

857
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,240
But I don't let you.

858
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,080
I know better the meanings of

859
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,400
disciplinary, obedience

860
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,160
and principle

861
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,000
than anyone else.

862
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,680
That's why you disobey my words?

863
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,000
It isn't

864
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,600
my principle.

865
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,200
I've learned a new word

866
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,400
from you.

867
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,680
Nonsense.

868
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,480
You don't need to worry about me just now.

869
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,160
As the captain,

870
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,440
it's my duty to protect my members,

871
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,000
especially on this matter.
