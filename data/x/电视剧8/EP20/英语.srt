1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,200
Shooting Stars EP20

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Sorry to interrupt.

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,440
But the word

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,480
"Shunchang"

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,280
inside the belt

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,520
has served as conclusive evidence.

8
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,080
I explained this

9
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
during the last trial.

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
Have you

11
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
forgotten?

12
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
We've obtained

13
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,880
the receipt.

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,880
It bears your mother's

15
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,160
signature.

16
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
Take a close look.

17
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,360
Let me see.

18
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Excuse me.

19
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,320
Thanks.

20
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
This signature

21
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
could also be forged.

22
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm skeptical

23
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
about the authenticity of the receipt.

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
After all, my mother

25
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,720
has no recollection of it.

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,800
She wouldn't lie, would she?

27
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
She only remembers ordering

28
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,160
a... pendant for a necklace

29
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,320
from this store.

30
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,800
How do you intend to prove it then?

31
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
After all,

32
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,320
we can't

33
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
keep doing this forever.

34
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,960
Well,

35
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,480
you know

36
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,280
I had Mr. Li

37
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,800
come over from Nanjing.

38
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,120
Let him speak.

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
If he can personally confirm

40
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,280
that this belt

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,000
was custom-made

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
in his shop by my mother,

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll drop the matter.

44
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,360
Okay?

45
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,200
Bring in Mr. Li.

46
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,280
Sir, can you fix it?

47
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm just a driver,

48
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,320
not a mechanic.

49
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
It's hard to say.

50
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,280
Probably

51
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,080
have to wait for the repair service.

52
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,240
Coming through!

53
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,320
Chief.

54
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,840
Mr. Li,

55
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,600
the reason you're here today

56
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
is to explain

57
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,480
to everyone

58
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,440
about

59
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,800
this belt

60
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,120
and the receipt

61
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,200
in question.

62
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,080
Please.

63
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay.

64
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
This receipt

65
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,840
was made when Mrs. Hua

66
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
purchased this belt at our store.

67
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,120
As the wife of the Undersecretary

68
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
of the Ministry of Military Affairs,

69
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,760
she often brings

70
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,440
high-society ladies

71
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,080
to shop at our store.

72
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,640
This belt wasn't cheap.

73
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
This... leather...

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,520
was imported.

75
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
I personally

76
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,960
crafted the buckle.

77
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,840
Mrs. Hua said

78
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,080
it's custom-made

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,200
for her second son.

80
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,960
Oh,

81
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,440
for the gentleman right there.

82
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,080
I've seen him in photos.

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,560
Mr. Li,

84
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
nice to meet you again.

85
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,760
What you said

86
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,960
will affect my brother's life.

87
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,040
Then be careful

88
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
with your words!

89
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
Tell me,

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
is everything you've

91
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,720
just said true?

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,600
Sure. All of it.

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
I swear to heaven.

94
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,600
Make way!

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,640
Move!

96
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,040
Step aside!

97
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,720
Captain! Here!

98
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,280
Captain!

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,040
Captain!

100
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,800
Finally.

101
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480
Captain, are you alright?

102
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,560
Captain, you've worked hard.

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,640
Hurry up! Move!

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:38,960
Quick!

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,200
Stop!

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,920
State your purpose.

107
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,080
We're bringing a witness

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,000
for the tribunal.

109
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,480
The investigation team

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,560
didn't notify us.

111
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
An important witness.

112
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,520
Maybe

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,080
you should go and check?

114
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,720
If there's a delay,

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
nobody wants that responsibility,

116
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,240
right?

117
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
Please check for us.

118
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,960
You all wait here.

119
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,760
Stay here.

120
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,280
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,440
Cigarette?

122
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,680
No, thanks.

123
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Where are you from?

124
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,680
The Northeast.

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,840
Wow,

126
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
that's great!

127
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,200
Don't move!

128
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,320
Stop! Stop!

129
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
Miss Luo, go inside!

130
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,440
Stop!

131
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,120
You can't go in!

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,840
Stop! Or I'll shoot!

133
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,760
No!

134
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,400
This is the witness

135
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,360
for Mr. Hua!

136
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,480
Calm down!

137
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,960
Hold it right there!

138
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Stop!

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,200
Honestly, I agree with Hua Zhen.

140
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm serious.

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,840
At this point,

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,640
the matter of the belt

143
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,960
is no longer important.

144
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
So what if it's his?

145
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,680
He just wanna save a man

146
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,920
who was an unexpected communist

147
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,720
out of sympathy.

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,960
Unfortunately,

149
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,000
the document for Xiang Yuansheng

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,720
has thoroughly

151
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,440
and definitively proved

152
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,000
that

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
Hua Zhen

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,320
is also a communist!

155
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,320
Mr. Hua,

156
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
I think this is

157
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,600
all we can do for now.

158
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,880
We can't

159
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,840
keep dragging this out.

160
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
Mr. Hua!

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
Mr. Hua!

162
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,480
Quiet! What are you doing?

163
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
The witness has arrived!

164
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,480
Mr. Hua!

165
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
The witness is here!

166
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,640
Mr. Hua!

167
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,080
Mr. Hua!

168
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Chief Tong, Commander Yang,

169
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,440
my witness has arrived.

170
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,360
Xiang Yuan Sheng.

171
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,600
We're not too late, are we?

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,200
Not at all. Just in time.

173
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,000
Find the landlady

174
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
who provided us tips

175
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
in Guangzhou,

176
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
and keep her silenced permanently.

177
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,800
Sorry,

178
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
but shall we continue?

179
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,640
Yuansheng!

180
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,680
Yuansheng!

181
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,600
Yuansheng!

182
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,200
The witness will stay.

183
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,440
Everyone else may leave.

184
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,800
Let's continue.

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,360
Yuansheng,

186
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,720
we'll wait for you outside!

187
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Wait outside. Don't worry.

188
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,520
Mrs. Xu, please.

189
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
I couldn't just let these 3 days

190
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,280
be a waste.

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
Apart from Mr. Li,

192
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,920
I also invited Mrs. Xu.

193
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,880
She is the landlady

194
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
of the apartment in Guangzhou

195
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,720
Captain Wei mentioned.

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
How is it possible?

197
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
She's still in Guangzhou yesterday...

198
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,120
How could she

199
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,800
get from Guangzhou

200
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
to Shanghai so quickly?

201
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
Because in your mind,

202
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,800
there's only boats and trains.

203
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,720
A military plane is available for us!

204
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
She left this morning,

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,920
just in time.

206
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,360
Mrs. Xu,

207
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
now you can talk

208
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,200
about the four documents.

209
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
Sir,

210
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,240
here's the situation.

211
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,120
Mr. Zhang is a distant relative of mine.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,200
He rented a room from me

213
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,240
and paid the rent,

214
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,440
but nobody ever moved in.

215
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,960
My son is getting married,

216
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,720
and I wanna take the house back

217
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,560
for him.

218
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,200
I found the documents

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,440
while cleaning out

220
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,280
the luggage.

221
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,240
I put them

222
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,800
in the suitcase,

223
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,960
all four of them.

224
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,440
Be responsible with what you say.

225
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,920
Mrs. Xu,

226
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,800
why didn't you report this

227
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
when I was in Guangzhou?

228
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
You

229
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,400
didn't ask me about it.

230
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
Take a look.

231
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,960
Is that them?

232
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,160
Yes...

233
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,840
Wait, this isn't right...

234
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
Uh...

235
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,920
The person

236
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,440
I remember

237
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
had a slightly

238
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,560
broader face,

239
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,240
totally different

240
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,640
from this one.

241
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,240
Is it this man?

242
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Yes, correct!

243
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
Definitely him!

244
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,920
Good.

245
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,440
Captain Wei,

246
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,920
how do you explain this now?

247
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Explain?

248
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,560
You seem to suspect

249
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,200
that our investigation team

250
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,960
is fabricating evidence.

251
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,680
Wei Daiqing!

252
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,200
I have every reason to believe

253
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,480
that what you've done

254
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,640
is purposed to frame my brother!

255
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Frame?

256
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,040
Mr. Hua,

257
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,760
a man of your status

258
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,560
needn't stoop

259
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,040
to such

260
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,600
low tactics with

261
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,640
a mere

262
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
investigation team captain.

263
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,000
This so-called new witness

264
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,480
is under your manipulation, innit?

265
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
Sir,

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,680
just before the hearing today,

267
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,240
I saw Mr. Hua

268
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
meeting with

269
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,320
a witness in the café

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
of the Jinmen Hotel.

271
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,160
What deal was struck there

272
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,560
remains unknown.

273
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,240
Whom I meet

274
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
is not important.

275
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,400
What matters is the evidence.

276
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,960
According to you,

277
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,920
these documents

278
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,680
have been

279
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,720
in your team's possession

280
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,000
since being taken

281
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
from the apartment,

282
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,120
right?

283
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,400
Correct.

284
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,920
Well then,

285
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,000
I'd like to know

286
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
how did the photo of He Youqing

287
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,160
turn into

288
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,840
my brother's?

289
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,120
Mr. Hua,

290
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,760
the investigation team has its protocols.

291
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,240
I assure all officials here,

292
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
the documents I saw

293
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
in the apartment

294
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,720
are exactly

295
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,280
as they were!

296
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,840
Not just I

297
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,800
handle the case alone,

298
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,560
all team members

299
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,040
were there watching.

300
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,920
I had no chance for any black box work!

301
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Who can testify to that?

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,880
I can.

303
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,680
Sir,

304
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,960
I went to the apartment

305
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,560
with Captain Wei that day.

306
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,880
The documents we obtained then

307
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,000
were indeed the ones we have now.

308
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,800
However,

309
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Mr. Hua is also correct.

310
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,400
The photo

311
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,640
for Xiang Yuansheng

312
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,560
has indeed been changed.

313
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,000
Gao Pingshun...

314
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,440
Commander!

315
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,000
Commander!

316
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,280
Gao Pingshun has been sweetened!

317
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,960
Commander!

318
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,880
Commander!

319
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,560
Wei Daiqing!

320
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,000
You have the nerve!

321
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
You have all officers of Shanghai

322
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
watching a drama with you!

323
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,520
Jesus!

324
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,640
Commander!

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,800
Commander!

326
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,240
Commander!

327
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,680
Xiang Yuansheng!

328
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,080
Yuansheng! Yuansheng!

329
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Yuansheng!

330
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,560
It's over.

331
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,200
Unlock him!

332
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,240
Our efforts weren't in vain!

333
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,200
Indeed!

334
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,800
Come on, quick!

335
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,680
Captain will be so relieved

336
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,640
to know you're safe!

337
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,480
All thanks to him

338
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,040
who pulled

339
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,480
the landlady here with a rickshaw!

340
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Minmin was impressive too!

341
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
Calling Mr. Hua

342
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
as soon as she entered the hall!

343
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,560
Precisely!

344
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,640
Thank you.

345
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,720
Thank you all.

346
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,960
Hongfa,

347
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,360
let's take Yuansheng

348
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,640
out for a bath later.

349
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,080
No problem!

350
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,640
Wash away the bad luck!

351
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,200
Right!

352
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,120
You must be hungry.

353
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,240
Later, go to my restaurant.

354
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,960
I'll make sure you eat well!

355
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,200
Eat all you want!

356
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,840
Sure.

357
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,440
Family Hua is really something.

358
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
Once Mr. Hua took a seat,

359
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
no one dared to speak up.

360
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,920
His is...

361
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,200
Chief...

362
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Chief Aide.

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I know he's an aide.

364
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,920
Keep it down.

365
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,360
Don't embarrass us here.

366
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Me?

367
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,080
Listen. That's called

368
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,760
the Chief Aide

369
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,440
in the Office of Aides.

370
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,800
Well, what does he do?

371
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,000
Come on.

372
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
You don't know that?

373
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
Let me explain,

374
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,240
The Chief Aide...

375
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,720
is...

376
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,960
Anyway, he's crucial

377
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
to the Office of Aides.

378
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,240
And the Office is inseparable

379
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
from the National Government...

380
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
Officers from the Fourth Station?

381
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,160
Yes.

382
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,880
He's an aide to the Chief Aide.

383
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,800
Mr. Hua wants to invite you

384
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,480
to dine together at the Jinmen Hotel.

385
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Jinmen Hotel?

386
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,880
That's a fancy place!

387
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,200
Will Yuansheng come too?

388
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,680
He will.

389
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,600
After the exoneration process

390
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,040
is

391
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,960
finished.

392
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,480
Oh,

393
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,320
what about our Captain?

394
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,160
He hasn't arrived yet.

395
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
Rest assured,

396
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,120
Mr. Hua will

397
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,200
make all well arranged.

398
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,160
Alright then.

399
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,560
I'll

400
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,800
take you there now.

401
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,200
Okay.

402
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,880
Sure.

403
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,240
Let's go.

404
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,760
Minmin, get in.

405
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,360
Let's move.

406
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,280
Miss Luo,

407
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,080
follow us.

408
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,680
Minmin, hurry up.

409
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,640
Coming.

410
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:21,840
Another thing,

411
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
please pick up our director too.

412
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,720
Okay.

413
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,200
Captain Wei.

414
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,840
Captain Wei,

415
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,320
don't you

416
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,800
owe me something?

417
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,640
You are too ambitious,

418
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,920
but your foundation

419
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,800
is not solid.

420
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,120
Nice shoes.

421
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,120
Liang,

422
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,360
you contacted Gao Pingshun, right?

423
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,880
He's been dissatisfied with Wei Daiqing.

424
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,360
I just gave him a push.

425
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,800
Won't he get into trouble

426
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,360
for betraying Wei?

427
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
I've arranged everything.

428
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,240
He wanna start a business in Hong Kong.

429
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,320
I've prepared

430
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,400
his boat ticket and money.

431
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,680
He leaves tomorrow at noon.

432
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,760
Will the owner of the jewelry shop

433
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,400
in trouble?

434
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,400
He'll go back

435
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,160
to run his shop in Nanjing.

436
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,680
No one will dare touch him there.

437
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,400
Hua Zhen,

438
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,000
I have to ask,

439
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,600
this isn't your first fight

440
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,160
in Shanghai, is it?

441
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,520
That wasn't a fight,

442
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,440
but a one-sided beating.

443
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,880
You seem to

444
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,440
forget all about the school regulations.

445
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,120
Go and say goodbye to him.

446
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,720
You

447
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,040
may not meet again.

448
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,160
Are you alright?

449
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm fine.

450
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,240
When do you plan to leave?

451
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
The first train this afternoon.

452
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,400
I thought you only

453
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,200
wasted a month

454
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,480
staying

455
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,360
in Shanghai

456
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,680
for the murder case.

457
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,680
Unexpectedly,

458
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,440
you also risked your future.

459
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,840
Go back and be a good naval officer.

460
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,080
You belong to the sea.

461
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,360
The airport is so far.

462
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,520
Didn't you think to call a taxi?

463
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,160
The car broke down.

464
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,600
I even had to hijack a rickshaw.

465
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,000
Hurry and catch your train.

466
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,840
I can't help if you're late.

467
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,560
If you

468
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,080
can't make it in the navy,

469
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,080
come back to us.

470
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,680
I can help with that.

471
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,760
If that day ever comes,

472
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,280
I'll be back.

473
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,600
Good.

474
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,880
Revert to your name

475
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,440
when back in Nanjing,

476
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,240
do your best

477
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,080
in the school training

478
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,320
or even fighting,

479
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,680
and forget what happened in Shanghai.

480
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,840
Anyway,

481
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,280
we're each destined

482
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,480
for different paths.

483
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Captain Chen,

484
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,040
thank you.

485
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,520
Don't call me that.

486
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,160
Call me Chen Hao.

487
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,520
Take care.

488
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,560
Goodbye.

489
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,720
Goodbye.

490
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,640
I planned to

491
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,480
treat your police friends to a meal,

492
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,120
but they

493
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,040
got suddenly called back

494
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,360
to a case.

495
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,760
I wanna...

496
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,080
say goodbye

497
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,280
to them in person.

498
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,240
There's no time now.

499
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,160
Maybe

500
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,480
call them later.

501
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,400
Also,

502
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
you need to cut all ties

503
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
with Shanghai.

504
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
Do you know why

505
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,280
Wei Daiqing

506
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,800
didn't do anything

507
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,120
when betrayed by Gao Pingshun?

508
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,840
Because

509
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,160
he changed the photo himself.

510
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,480
Then,

511
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,760
how did

512
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,680
a small team leader

513
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,480
have the guts

514
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,720
to investigate our family?

515
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,680
Do you think he can do it himself?

516
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,680
And why

517
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,920
didn't I pursue it further?

518
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,080
Because if we

519
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,360
kept digging,

520
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,880
we'd uncover things we shouldn't.

521
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,160
Our family

522
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,120
is closely tied to Family Kong,

523
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,800
which could easily make us a target.

524
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,800
If something happens to you,

525
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,360
it will draw predators

526
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,760
towards me and our father.

527
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,400
Honestly,

528
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,800
you should think more

529
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,160
about the family.

530
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,680
I've got one more thing to handle.

531
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,000
You go to the train station.

532
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,160
I'll be there shortly.

533
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,920
Drive to the station

534
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,080
and watch him get aboard.

535
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,800
Yes, sir.

536
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Sir, all set.

537
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,240
Erbai,

538
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,080
I bet this meal

539
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,840
will cost us half a year's salary.

540
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,920
More than that.

541
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,760
More?

542
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,280
Dongbao,

543
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,840
you're impressive today,

544
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,280
grabbing the man just like that.

545
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,480
I grew up wrestling pigs.

546
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,800
Grabbing him was just instinct.

547
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,880
Erbai was the real star,

548
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,480
"No! Calm down!"

549
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,280
Right?

550
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:09,920
Tell me,

551
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,840
weren't you scared?

552
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,240
The gun was right on you.

553
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,640
What if...?

554
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I was sweating bullets.

555
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,880
Thanks to

556
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,960
experience and courage.

557
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,960
Watch and learn.

558
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,800
But you all did

559
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
very well today.

560
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,840
We had some good teamwork.

561
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,320
We deserve

562
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,800
applause!

563
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,840
Don't eat now.

564
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,960
But have a drink.

565
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
We kindly remind you

566
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,680
to take care of

567
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,400
all your belongings

568
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,680
and watch your step.

569
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,360
Please check your ticket quickly

570
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,880
and get aboard.

571
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,600
Hold on a second.

572
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,600
The train is about to leave.

573
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,840
Young Master!

574
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,880
Young Master!

575
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,680
We don't have time,

576
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,240
please

577
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,240
don't make this difficult.

578
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,160
Excuse me.

579
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,920
I'm from the S.M.C.

580
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,000
of the Ministry of Military Affairs.

581
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,560
May I

582
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,920
give an emergency call?

583
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,600

585

Hello, the Fourth Station House.

586
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,080
This is Xiang Yuansheng

587
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,040
speaking.

588
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,520

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Is Luo Minmin there?

593
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
No, she isn't.

594
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,840
She's now

595
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,920
at the Jinmen Hotel.

596
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,520
I'm about to head there myself.

597
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,400
Your brother invited us...

598
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,080
He hung up?

599
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,600
Miss Luo, right?

600
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,120
Yes.

601
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,920
Your call.

602
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,840
Thank you.

603
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,400
Hello, may I

604
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,280
ask who's calling?

605
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,840
This is

606
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,240
Xiang Yuansheng.

607
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,320
Why...?

608
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,920
I'm at the train station now.

609
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,720
It's almost impossible

610
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,840
to see everyone again.

611
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,320
Could you please

612
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,560
pass on my thanks?

613
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,480
Sure,

614
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,240
I will relay your message.

615
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,440
I major in navigation science

616
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,560
at Class 3 of the S.M.C.

617
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,160
What?

618
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,520
I'm

619
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,400
at Class 3

620
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
of the S.M.C.

621
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
in Jiangyin.

622
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
We can write to each other.

623
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,920
A letter from Jiangyin to Shanghai

624
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,520
only takes a week.

625
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,640
I'll write to you.

626
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,040
The train to Nanjing

627
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,400
is about to leave.

628
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,040
Please get aboard quickly.

629
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,880
Luo Minmin,

630
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
did you hear that?

631
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,320
I saw you being taken away,

632
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,240
and interrogated

633
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,360
in handcuffs

634
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,000
and chains.

635
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,880
I know

636
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,520
you might not have come out.

637
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,560
This is different

638
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,600
from the cases we handled

639
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,680
at the Fourth Station.

640
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,080
Maybe you don't care,

641
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,760
but I was really scared.

642
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
Should we keep in touch?

643
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,360
What if something happens to you again?

644
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,760
What if you get

645
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
locked up

646
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,480
and die?

647
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,800
What should I do

648
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,680
if you are

649
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,200
not rescued

650
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,160
next time?

651
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,440
Just remember

652
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,160
that I'm Hua Zhen,

653
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,640
at Class 3 of the S.M.C.

654
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,040
That's all that matters.

655
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,680
I will write to you.

656
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,560
Write back to me.

657
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,520
Did you get that?

658
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,600
The train is about to leave!

659
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,640
Please hurry to board!

660
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,120
Young Master,

661
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,280
we're running out of time.

662
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,160
The train is about to leave.

663
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,000
Wait!

664
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,080
Luo Minmin,

665
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,960
answer me.

666
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,840
Okay,

667
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,240
I promise.

668
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,960
It's the time

669
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,360
for the train to Nanjing.

670
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,320
Thank you.

671
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,160
Miss Luo,

672
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,320
I've gathered

673
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,400
that you met

674
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,160
during your police duties.

675
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,960
So, you've known

676
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,240
each other for no more than a month?

677
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,240
Yes.

678
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Actually,

679
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,120
Xiang Yuansheng

680
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,880
saying we were in a relationship

681
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,640
was also a way

682
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,240
to deal with the investigative team.

683
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,560
I suspect

684
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,520
it's not just that.

685
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,880
Otherwise, why would you

686
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,360
talk until midnight?

687
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,000
It's because

688
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
he was leaving the next day.

689
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
So we talked late.

690
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,880
May I ask

691
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,160
what you discussed?

692
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,640
About the navy,

693
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,760
the reason why he chose to join it,

694
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
the gap

695
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,000
between our fleet

696
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,600
and Japan's,

697
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,400
the story

698
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,920
of me becoming a police officer,

699
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,000
and family.

700
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Family?

701
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,720
Yes.

702
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,000
He talked about his relationship

703
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,280
with his father,

704
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,680
and how it's completely different

705
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,000
from mine.

706
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,600
He sounded like a little boy

707
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
when he mentioned that.

708
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Since you've

709
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,760
shared so much,

710
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,840
I won't

711
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,440
consider you an outsider.

712
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,840
Since you're

713
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,600
a police officer,

714
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,360
I respect that greatly.

715
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Out of respect,

716
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,560
I want to make things clear.

717
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,680
It's the

718
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,600
holiday period of the S.M.C.

719
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,000
After that,

720
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,960
Hua Zhen will return

721
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,200
to continue his training.

722
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Once at sea, he'll be gone for months,

723
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,000
and after graduation,

724
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,360
he will stay in Nanjing.

725
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,880
He won't come back to Shanghai.

726
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,640
That's his life plan.

727
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,120
This isn't

728
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,560
fair to you.

729
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,600
Do you understand?

730
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Yes.

731
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,200
Let me add a bit more.

732
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,880
Our family

733
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,800
might seem

734
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,320
more powerful than others,

735
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,840
but it's mostly not by choice.

736
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,000
If Hua Zhen gets into trouble,

737
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,040
we'll spare no expense to save him.

738
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,000
But he must also fulfill

739
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,520
his duties to the family.

740
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,640
For instance,

741
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,600
he's about to be engaged soon.

742
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,240
He didn't tell you, right?

743
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,920
He didn't intentionally conceal it from you,

744
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,120
but he himself didn't know about it.

745
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,320
That's what I mean by

746
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,800
not by choice.

747
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,560
You've seen

748
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,920
his situation.

749
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,600
His behavior here

750
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,240
is so weird.

751
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,240
He's going off track.

752
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,280
That's why I need him

753
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,480
to cut all ties

754
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,600
with Shanghai

755
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,880
because he can't be

756
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,760
lucky every time.

757
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Perhaps what I'm saying

758
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
may not persuade you,

759
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,240
but you must care

760
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,360
about his safety.

761
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,160
So, for this reason,

762
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,560
please sever your ties with him.

763
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,360
Then he has no distractions.

764
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,360
I've taken care of the bill

765
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
in the private room

766
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and

767
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
paid double.

768
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Order whatever you like.

769
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,120
I am in a hurry

770
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,000
to go to the train station.

771
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,280
I won't say thanks

772
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,760
to everyone in person.

773
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,800
Please

774
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,240
convey our gratitude

775
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,760
on behalf of my brother and me.

776
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
Until we meet again.

777
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,480
Young Master.
