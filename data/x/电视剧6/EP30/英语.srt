1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,600
[You Are My Secret]
[EP30]

3
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
[Unlocked.]

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,080
Welcome back.

5
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,119
Why are you still awake at this hour?

6
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,119
[Locked.]

7
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm feeling a bit unsettled.

8
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,119
I just dropped

9
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,640
Weiyi off at her place.

10
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,440
How's Qi Yu doing?

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Not good.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Ling Weiyi has been crying non-stop.

13
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:05,399
I really don't know

14
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,519
how to comfort her.

15
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,399
They've been together for so many years,

16
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,360
from college until now.

17
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,440
They've had their ups and downs.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,519
But no matter how much they cry or fight,

19
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,319
I know that

20
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,359
they both love each other deeply.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,599
That's true.

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,280
[I never imagined]

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,120
it would end up like this.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,359
For dating,

25
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,680
you just need to focus on the present.

26
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,759
So everything feels simple.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,960
And beautiful.

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,240
But once it comes to marriage,

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,400
you have to think

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,479
a lot about the future.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,759
That's when various

32
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,240
real-life issues arise.

33
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,400
Seeing them like this,

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,039
I can't help but feel

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,120
so lucky myself!

36
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,280
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

37
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,680
Thank you for choosing me back then.

38
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,039
I also want to give myself some credit

39
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,520
for agreeing to date you

40
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,680
at that time.

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,280
You really should be thanking yourself.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,560
[Xiaoning,]

43
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,680
[we just got word from Mr. Fu.]

44
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,039
[He's scheduled a meeting for tomorrow.]

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,400
[We'll need to work late tonight]

46
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,759
[to refine the plan a bit.]

47
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,079
[Let's meet at the office.]

48
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,759
[OK.]

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,599
[I've prepared a few proposals.]

50
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,560
[Let's go over them together.]

51
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
Ling Weiyi couldn't fall asleep.

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,359
She wants me to keep her company.

53
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,960
Cool.

54
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,560
I also need to go somewhere.

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,960
Qi Yu

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
wants to grab another drink with me.

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,799
What a coincidence.

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,079
Let me drive you there.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,960
No, I'm good.

60
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,199
I'll

61
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,799
call a driver,

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,680
or I can just take a taxi.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Alright.

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,199
It's getting late.

65
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,160
We should all take a taxi.

66
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,120
Sounds good.

67
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:55,759
Let's go.

68
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,479
Let's go.

69
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,319
It's getting really late.

70
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,520
How come he is still not home?

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
It's the middle of the night.

72
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,560
And Fanggang isn't home?

73
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,680
He said he left behind

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,359
an important document at the bank.

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,400
He insisted on rushing back to get it.

76
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,919
Your Mr. Ji

77
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:22,919
isn't home either, is he?

78
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,000
Nope.

79
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,880
Looks like our opponent for tomorrow

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,799
is pretty obvious.

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
These two guys

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,400
are quite childish.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,599
And petty.

84
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:33,919
Isn't it just

85
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,239
competing for the same client?

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,799
What's there to hide?

87
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:37,880
Seriously.

88
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:38,760
Exactly.

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,799
But when

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
we left home,

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,439
we didn't tell them either, did we?

92
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:43,919
Nope.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
When Fanggang left,

94
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,559
I was still at home,

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,599
pretending to be asleep.

96
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,039
So he probably thinks

97
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:52,880
I'm still lying in bed at home.

98
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,359
And you just called him

99
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:54,960
petty.

100
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,119
Double standards, huh?

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
Business world is like a battlefield.

102
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,439
Every trick in the book is fair.

103
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,559
We're just pulling the same stun.

104
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:02,960
Let's focus on the plan.

105
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:03,439
Come on.

106
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
Jing,

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,320
Be cautious.

108
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Mr. Zhao might be playing dumb.

109
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,840
That guy?

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
He's just a lightweight.

111
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,919
His tricks don't work on me.

112
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,520
But you should be extremely careful

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
about your Mr. Ji.

114
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,239
My Mr. Ji

115
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,520
is really quite cunning and shrewd.

116
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:19,999
He said that he was going to

117
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,720
have a drink with

118
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,559
my bestie's boyfriend.

119
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,999
I instantly figured him out.

120
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,640
Zhao Fanggang's

121
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,359
stunts won't work on me whatsoever.

122
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:40,799
I think that's about it.

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,239
Come on.

124
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,239
Take a look.

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,799
I'm so sleepy.

126
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,039
I can't even remember how much

127
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:53,559
coffee I've had today.

128
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,280
I heard that

129
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,119
now Mr. Fu's got

130
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:01,960
only two banks left

131
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,679
in the competition.

132
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Do you think we are up against

133
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,479
another branch from Dairui?

134
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,239
That can't be right.

135
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
When I left home,

136
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Ms. Rao had just fallen asleep.

137
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,280
Logically speaking,

138
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,080
for such a significant client meeting,

139
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,479
with her personality,

140
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,479
she definitely wouldn't sleep well.

141
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,239
If you're so curious,

142
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,679
just give her a call.

143
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:23,880
Then you will find out what's going on.

144
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,239
That wouldn't be appropriate.

145
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,520
She's pregnant now.

146
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,799
It's not easy for her to get a good sleep.

147
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,999
Hopefully, we're not competing with her.

148
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,119
After all, Mr. Fu is not someone

149
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,559
I'd want my wife

150
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,200
to have too much contact with.

151
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,119
Why is that?

152
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,599
I've heard that

153
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:43,919
when Mr. Fu

154
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,559
was abroad,

155
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,439
he was quite the playboy.

156
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,520
He changed his girlfriends

157
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,559
like collecting stamps.

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,119
With all different types of girls.

159
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,359
What do they call this type of guys

160
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,280
in TV shows?

161
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,280
A debauched playboy.

162
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,039
Yeah.

163
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
Hey, come on,

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
you're still so nosy.

165
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,679
We just need to focus on

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,799
our own duties.

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,599
As for the client's emotional preferences,

168
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,799
let's not overanalyze.

169
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,039
Alright.

170
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,039
[He clearly left later than I did.]

171
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
[How did he manage to arrive first?]

172
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,320
[I can't let him get ahead of me.]

173
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
[I have to meet Mr. Fu]

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
[before him.]

175
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,080
Hey, Xiaoning.

176
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:39,880
I accidentally

177
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,760
scratched my car

178
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,720
while making a U-turn.

179
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,280
[I think I saw your car nearby.]

180
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,559
You're around, right?

181
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,919
Could you come here and help me out?

182
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:46,880
Is it serious?

183
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,200
Where exactly are you?

184
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,559
I'm right at

185
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,239
the entrance of Aijin.

186
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:52,919
Got it.

187
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,960
I'm on my way.

188
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,559
Just wait for me.

189
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,280
OK.

190
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,160
Sorry.

191
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:57,880
I'll be right back.

192
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,840
Hey,

193
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:10,840
excuse me,

194
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,679
has there been a

195
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,080
minor collision around here?

196
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,880
Collision?

197
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:14,400
Yeah.

198
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:16,840
I haven't seen anything.

199
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,999
Is it in here?

200
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:18,599
Yes.

201
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,520
Just that white car.

202
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,720
I really didn't see anything.

203
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Alright.

204
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,520
I'll just go and check it out.

205
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:23,960
OK.

206
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,280
No problem.

207
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,840
Thanks.

208
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,719
Victory knows no rules.

209
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,000
Worrying only leads to confusion.

210
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,120
This is our president, Mr. Fu.

211
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:03,839
Mr. Fu.

212
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,360
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fu.

213
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,799
I'm from the Dairui Xingcheng branch.

214
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,319
My name is Tu Xiaoning,

215
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,039
an account manager.

216
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,880
Nice to meet you.

217
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,400
Mr. Zhou, how do you

218
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,199
reduce the print size on this printer?

219
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,120
I tried a few times, but it's not working.

220
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,959
Let me take a look.

221
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,919
The printer's programming

222
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,600
has a bit of a problem.

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
I'll have the admin

224
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,079
find someone to fix it.

225
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,000
Excuse me,

226
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,039
allow me to take a look.

227
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,919
This should be

228
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,799
a problem with the print size command.

229
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,079
Just a quick adjustment will do.

230
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,799
Mr. Fu,

231
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,520
how small do you want to

232
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,360
reduce the business license?

233
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
As long as it fits on an A4 paper.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,719
Thank you!

235
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,520
It seems that Ms. Tu

236
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,799
is very proactive in

237
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,000
solving problems.

238
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:15,719
I'm flattered.

239
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,839
Practice makes perfect.

240
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
We often help clients reduce

241
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,079
the size of their business licenses.

242
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,559
So I've become familiar with it.

243
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:26,880
Please have a seat.

244
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,400
Thank you.

245
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,319
The last time I visited here,

246
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,839
I noticed you're

247
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,160
quite interested in coffee.

248
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,199
There's a new hand-brewed coffee shop

249
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,160
next to my office,

250
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,959
and this is their product.

251
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:37,839
Please try it.

252
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,799
Thanks.

253
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,199
Ms. Tu, your keen observation skills

254
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:42,880
are quite impressive.

255
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,679
I've reviewed your proposal.

256
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,039
Using a letter of credit instead of a loan

257
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,079
is a solid approach.

258
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,839
However, from what I understand,

259
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:02,039
a letter of credit

260
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,000
isn't always convenient.

261
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,039
When it expires, it requires a discount

262
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,959
or payment.

263
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,520
What's your take on this,

264
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,719
Ms. Tu?

265
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,039
I suggested a letter of credit

266
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,839
mainly from

267
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,120
a cost-saving perspective.

268
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,039
[Youpin Tea]

269
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,400
[is a significant taxpayer]

270
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,480
[in Xingcheng.]

271
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,160
You have ample tax invoices.

272
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:20,719
So if you opt for a letter of credit,

273
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,120
the costs

274
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,600
will be considerably lower than

275
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:24,679
taking a loan.

276
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,520
Regarding the inconvenience you mentioned,

277
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,839
our bank has already

278
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,160
upgraded

279
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,319
the process.

280
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,520
It's now very efficient.

281
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,039
You can be assured of that.

282
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,919
If I'm not mistaken,

283
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,439
you're likely planning to venture into

284
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,520
instant tea beverages next.

285
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,520
In that case, the costs won't be low.

286
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,280
If you'd like to

287
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,480
work with us,

288
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,319
I can arrange

289
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,280
to waive your

290
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,000
service fees

291
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,839
and acceptance fees.

292
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,679
This way, you can save more money.

293
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:51,839
You really know how to

294
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,719
gauge people's feelings.

295
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,760
Not really.

296
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,880
This isn't about gauging feelings.

297
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,719
I simply

298
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,360
prefer to approach things from

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,959
the client's perspective.

300
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,880
Mr. President,

301
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:10,799
are you here to meet a client?

302
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,719
About the client you mentioned earlier,

303
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,600
could he be...

304
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,799
Didn't you tell me

305
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,000
you had a collision?

306
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,520
Shouldn't you have waited at the entrance?

307
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,000
I got out of the car and checked.

308
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:22,559
It was nothing serious.

309
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,719
Work takes priority.

310
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,640
So I went upstairs

311
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,439
to discuss business.

312
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,679
I apologize for that.

313
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:28,559
I didn't mean to cause you any worry.

314
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,039
Making me worry is trivial,

315
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,559
but regarding the client,

316
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,160
you keep saying I don't play by the book.

317
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,760
What about you?

318
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,559
I have no choice, do I?

319
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,919
Clients like Mr. Fu are certainly

320
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,719
sought after by many.

321
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,240
Everyone is eager to present their plans.

322
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,839
[It's about who makes the first impression.]

323
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,400
[If you leave a strong impression,]

324
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,400
then no matter how good

325
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,039
the later presentations are,

326
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,280
it won't matter.

327
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,160
Because there's essentially nothing new.

328
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,240
After all, these proposals

329
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
are pretty much the same.

330
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:51,719
Right?

331
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,400
Sounds quite candid.

332
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:55,919
Where's Mr. Zhao?

333
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,520
Why isn't he here?

334
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,240
Is Mr. president

335
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,919
here to discuss business alone?

336
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,160
Isn't Rao Jing also absent?

337
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,039
Jing is unwell.

338
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
She worked late last night

339
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,240
and needs to go to the hospital today.

340
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,760
Mr. Zhao is taking his wife

341
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,839
to the hospital, who is feeling unwell

342
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,079
after working late

343
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:13,760
last night.

344
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,079
Got it.

345
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,559
I will

346
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,559
be off then.

347
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,319
Just a friendly heads-up,

348
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,559
Mr. Fu

349
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,160
seems to have a multinational

350
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,120
business meeting for this afternoon.

351
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,959
I'm not sure if he'll have time

352
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:30,760
to meet with Mr. Ji today.

353
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,120
Regardless,

354
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:32,839
I wish you

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,600
all the best.

356
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,039
This is only your first time

357
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,039
meeting this Mr. Fu.

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Nothing is confirmed yet.

359
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:41,360
So don't get too excited.

360
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,160
Bite me.

361
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Since Mr. Fu is so keen

362
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,799
to collaborate with us,

363
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,039
you should keep a close watch on this.

364
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,520
Get the process wrapped up soon.

365
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,120
I just got out of the hospital.

366
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,439
It's nothing serious.

367
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,679
I'll be at the office shortly.

368
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,079
The order has already been placed.

369
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,079
You're really not going to get checked?

370
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,439
I'm perfectly fine,

371
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,000
so why waste the money?

372
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,240
Whoa,

373
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:14,959
Rao Jing,

374
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,959
were you trying to fool me?

375
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,559
Not at all.

376
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,319
But don't worry,

377
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,160
your president, Mr. Ji was also tricked.

378
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,439
So your supervisor, Mr. Ji

379
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:23,280
won't hold it against you.

380
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,559
He won't blame you for this.

381
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,319
Dirty tricks

382
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,079
won't work every time.

383
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,160
This is the first major client

384
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,880
that Yuheng assigned to me

385
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,760
after I joined the Jian branch.

386
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm not giving up.

387
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,240
Honey,

388
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,319
let me ask you,

389
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,039
between Ji Yuheng and me,

390
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,360
who's your boss?

391
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,719
In life, it's definitely you.

392
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,079
But at work,

393
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,959
it has to be him.

394
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:45,839
Another question,

395
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,799
we work hard.

396
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,280
Isn't it all for a better life?

397
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,839
Yes.

398
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,360
Isn't it so that you can provide

399
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,439
a better life for me and the kids?

400
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:51,959
Absolutely.

401
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,919
What's your angle here?

402
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,719
You see, my position is higher than yours.

403
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,600
If I take on this project,

404
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,839
the commission and bonuses

405
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,000
will definitely surpass yours.

406
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,719
This is very beneficial

407
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:03,760
for our family.

408
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,120
Honey,

409
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,919
Mr. Ji

410
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,160
has already promised me the

411
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,079
manager position of the

412
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,839
business development department in Jian.

413
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,280
Once I secure the project,

414
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
I'll get promoted right away.

415
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,160
At that point,

416
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,559
I'll be earning just as much as you,

417
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,480
and I'll be one level higher.

418
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:17,439
So it sounds like

419
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:18,799
I'm the one getting the better deal here.

420
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,280
Ms. Rao,

421
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,719
you've been clever all your life,

422
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,480
but you still miscalculated one thing.

423
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,199
But that's alright.

424
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,160
Don't take it to heart.

425
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:28,760
We're all doing this for the family.

426
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,919
Hands off!

427
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:31,919
Honey,

428
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,039
what would you like to eat? I'm buying.

429
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,240
Don't be upset, hon.

430
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,160
Getting angry can affect the baby.

431
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,760
You two haven't seen each other

432
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,839
for quite some time, right?

433
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,160
Do you plan to keep dragging this out?

434
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:46,880
I've blown through a few thousand

435
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,439
we had saved up.

436
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,439
How could we even meet?

437
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,079
Besides,

438
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,799
he hasn't reached out to me either.

439
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,280
If you want him to apologize,

440
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,520
I can go talk to him.

441
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:58,480
Never mind.

442
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,199
This time, it's different.

443
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,799
I've got a hunch

444
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,160
that even if we meet and make amends,

445
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,160
it won't address the core issues.

446
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,079
We'll inevitably end up back here.

447
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,679
I really can't wrap my head around this.

448
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,400
Why is it that for others,

449
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,439
not having money is a problem,

450
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,439
but for me, having money

451
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:19,600
becomes a problem instead?

452
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,959
Luxury cars,

453
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,880
a mansion in downtown,

454
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,199
and endless credit cards...

455
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,160
I've got all of these.

456
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,919
I don't feel

457
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,919
there's any issue at all.

458
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,240
Ordinary people

459
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,559
work hard their entire lives.

460
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,160
Isn't it all to

461
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,520
achieve a life like this?

462
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm living it now,

463
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,919
yet I still have to reflect on myself.

464
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,000
And change myself.

465
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,160
What nonsense is all this?

466
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,439
And him?

467
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,079
He can't just go with the flow

468
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:47,719
and live

469
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,120
comfortably in my world.

470
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,880
I thought to myself,

471
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,240
alright then.

472
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,120
I'll make an effort

473
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,360
to get closer to his world.

474
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,880
But I soon realized that

475
00:16:58,439 --> 00:16:59,400
it seems impossible.

476
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,360
Scraping by just to make ends meet,

477
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
buying a house in the suburbs,

478
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,839
commuting two hours every day,

479
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,719
and I can't even enjoy a cake on weekends.

480
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,959
I really can't live like that.

481
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,080
Neither of you is wrong.

482
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:15,600
It's fundamentally about how

483
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
you both perceive money.

484
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,560
Yours are different.

485
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,919
Your needs for life are also different.

486
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,759
These differences didn't surface when you

487
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,519
were in college or during the

488
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,519
early days of your relationship.

489
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,640
If you both want to

490
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,919
move forward,

491
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,759
these issues

492
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,320
will gradually

493
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,360
come to the forefront.

494
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:29,719
That's true.

495
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:31,919
We've both

496
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
tried our best to make it work.

497
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,320
Hey, Tingting.

498
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,199
[Xiaoning,]

499
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,360
[do you have any plans this afternoon?]

500
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,080
I have a client who just

501
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,439
asked me to meet all of a sudden.

502
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,320
He insisted that we must meet today.

503
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,560
But I've already scheduled

504
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,999
an appointment with another client.

505
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,759
I really can't meet him.

506
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,840
Xiaoning...

507
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:00,560
That's alright.

508
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,439
How about this:

509
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,400
just send me the

510
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
files of this client,

511
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,160
and the location of your meeting.

512
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,640
I will see him in your stead shortly.

513
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,279
[Thank you so much, Xiaoning!]

514
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,560
[I'll send them to you right away.]

515
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,519
No problem.

516
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,279
Go on.

517
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,679
Don't worry about me!

518
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:16,759
I'll be

519
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,519
heading back to work as well.

520
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,040
Huihuang Advertising?

521
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,519
I'm going.

522
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,080
If you're feeling down,

523
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,120
text me on WeChat.

524
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:30,880
Don't worry about me.

525
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,560
Help me clean up, OK?

526
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,999
Sure.

527
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,320
[Shouldn't it be called "Huihuang"?]
[*another character in mandarin]

528
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,679
[Could it be that]

529
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,479
[the boss' name contains]

530
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,279
[the character "Hui"?]

531
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,439
May I ask,

532
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,840
what is your boss' surname?

533
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,239
Our boss' surname is Yu.

534
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,199
I read the profile

535
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,199
of your company.

536
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:03,880
He is neither the legal representative

537
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
nor a stakeholder.

538
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,160
The legal representative is his mother,

539
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,199
and the stakeholder is his wife.

540
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,439
Technically, he doesn't hold

541
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,519
any official position.

542
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,560
No wonder.

543
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,439
You're from the bank, right?

544
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,320
Sorry, I was running late.

545
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,560
I urgently need a small loan,

546
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,239
so I thought

547
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,199
I'd make some time this afternoon

548
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,120
to meet you.

549
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,479
This is quite last-minute, huh?

550
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,160
No problem, Mr. Yu.

551
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm Tu Xiaoning,

552
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
an account manager for Dairui.

553
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:25,840
Here's my business card.

554
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,239
[Tingting and I are colleagues.]

555
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,400
[Today, we'll just]

556
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
[have a brief discussion.]

557
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,919
If you have

558
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,199
further needs in the future,

559
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
Tingting will be your main contact.

560
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,759
Tu Xiaoning?

561
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,800
You went to Xincai High School,

562
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,640
class 12, right?

563
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,759
Yeah.

564
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,160
So it's really you, Tu Xiaoning!

565
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,400
It's me!

566
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,439
Don't you remember?

567
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,320
Back in high school,

568
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,759
after we finished evening classes,

569
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:51,640
you fell off your bike

570
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,279
into a sewer.

571
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,519
Yu Hui?

572
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,959
Yes, that's me!

573
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:57,400
Come on, have a seat!

574
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,199
Thanks.

575
00:19:59,239 --> 00:19:59,840
OK,

576
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,120
could you grab some good tea

577
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,519
from my trunk?

578
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,600
I'd like to catch up

579
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,439
with my classmate.

580
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,400
Get the best one!

581
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,919
Thank you.

582
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,439
No problem.

583
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,959
So you're working at the bank now?

584
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:12,959
Yes, I am,

585
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,800
as an account manager.

586
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,040
Funny coincidence, I'm here to discuss

587
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,759
a business opportunity with Mr. Yu.

588
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,759
Please don't tease me.

589
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,840
This "Mr. Yu" is really no big deal.

590
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,320
I just didn't do well in school,

591
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,040
and never received a good education.

592
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:24,800
So I

593
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,959
just opened a small company.

594
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,560
[Doing my own stuff.]

595
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,439
[I originally thought]

596
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,160
[I'd consult the bank]

597
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
about small loans.

598
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:31,160
Now that you're here,

599
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:31,919
I won't need anyone else.

600
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,759
I'll just come to you.

601
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,439
Consider this

602
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,320
my apology for

603
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,959
being a brat back then

604
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:37,759
and bullying you.

605
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,400
It's been so many years.

606
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
Let's put it all behind us.

607
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,759
We were

608
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,400
just kids back then.

609
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Besides, it was my fault too.

610
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,600
Throwing a basketball at you was wrong.

611
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,400
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

612
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,320
Looking back.

613
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,840
I was really a jerk and immature.

614
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,560
I can't believe I used to bully

615
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,439
my female classmates.

616
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,719
I was a monster!

617
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,560
That's exaggerated.

618
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,519
I remember

619
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
the famous handsome Ji Yuheng

620
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,239
stood up

621
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,160
and stopped me

622
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,759
from making serious mistakes.

623
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,160
By the way,

624
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,800
things between you two

625
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,279
got special, huh?

626
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:19,479
Who?

627
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,519
What special?

628
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,919
Nothing.

629
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,840
Seeing you

630
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,080
reminds me of another old friend.

631
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,199
It's been ten years.

632
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,560
I tell you, I'm a very

633
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,479
gregarious person.

634
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,959
I've always wanted to throw a party

635
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,519
and invite all the classmates

636
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,120
in the city

637
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,360
for a good chat.

638
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,759
Right.

639
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,479
Can I have your WeChat number?

640
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,239
Yes.

641
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,759
If I really have a party,

642
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,040
you have to be there.

643
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,439
I'll scan it.

644
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:46,919
Okay.

645
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,719
Here.

646
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,600
Tingting.

647
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,880
You've got the contract?

648
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,279
What a small world.

649
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,199
That guy happens to be

650
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,160
my classmate from high school.

651
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,120
We've made the deal.

652
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,600
You can take care of

653
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,719
the paperwork and credit.

654
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,959
He'll contact you in a couple days.

655
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,679
Thank you, Xiaoning.

656
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,560
We can split the credit.

657
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:05,400
Alright.

658
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,519
Thank you.

659
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,360
[Xiaoning!]

660
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,199
Well,

661
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,600
Mr. Fu from Youpin is here.

662
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,400
He's waiting for you.

663
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,719
The younger Fu?

664
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,279
Yes.

665
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,320
He's here in person?

666
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,360
Yes. Get over there.

667
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,080
Okay, okay.

668
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,439
You can do this.

669
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,719
Ms. Tu.

670
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,959
My apology, Mr. Fu.

671
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,080
I just had to

672
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,239
go out for a while.

673
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,080
Sorry for the wait.

674
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,320
It's okay, Ms. Tu.

675
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,560
I didn't make the appointment either.

676
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,479
I've read your

677
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,560
financing proposal.

678
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,040
I think the details must be

679
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,279
decided face to face.

680
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,439
I happen to be near on business.

681
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,040
So here I am.

682
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:37,999
Thank you, Ms. Tu.

683
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,239
You revised the plan

684
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
immediately after our last chat.

685
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,199
I'm looking forward to our

686
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,600
future cooperation.

687
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:45,959
Me too.

688
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:48,959
So,

689
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,239
let's go through it one by one.

690
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:51,160
Okay.

691
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,279
Why don't you sit over here?

692
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,400
It's more convenient.

693
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:57,719
Okay.

694
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,320
You can take a look at this.

695
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,040
This one.

696
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:10,999
Last time

697
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:11,919
we mentioned

698
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,919
the FMCG tea drinks.

699
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,080
As for specific

700
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,919
in-house names and sizes,

701
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,800
I need you

702
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,679
to give me

703
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,679
more detailed

704
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,320
information

705
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
before I can add.

706
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,360
So I can't add this one

707
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
before I have...

708
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,519
...more information

709
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,919
from you.

710
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Why so nervous?

711
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,279
Relax.

712
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,560
It's okay.

713
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,160
I'm fine.

714
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:37,719
I'll leave you to it.

715
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,640
Are you a local, Ms. Tu?

716
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,360
You can call me Xiaoning, Mr. Fu.

717
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:50,320
I am a local.

718
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,800
I heard

719
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,719
you came back from studying abroad

720
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,519
for your doctorate.

721
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,160
I've been a PhD student for two years,

722
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,800
because I didn't want to come back

723
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,640
to take over the family business.

724
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,759
To stall for time,

725
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,519
I had to go on with my degree.

726
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,479
Are you thinking,

727
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,759
"He came back

728
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,560
to take over in the end."

729
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,320
It's not my choice.

730
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,279
Not everything

731
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,120
goes smoothly for the rich.

732
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,120
Right.

733
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,519
[I want to know]

734
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,080
[if Weiyi is feeling better.]

735
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,800
What's on your mind?

736
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:27,600
Nothing.

737
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,640
Here's the elevator.

738
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,080
Have a nice day.

739
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:36,640
Ms. Tu.

740
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:37,600
No need for seeing me off.

741
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,999
We'll meet again soon.

742
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,640
Well, take care.

743
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,999
What are you looking at?

744
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:46,880
Xiaoning.

745
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,560
It's for you.

746
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:48,880
For me?

747
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,959
Open it up.

748
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,439
[Yes.]

749
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,120
[It's for you.]

750
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,239
It's from Mr. Fu.

751
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:53,800
I take it here

752
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,880
from the conference room.

753
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,080
He must have seen you

754
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,880
working too hard lately.

755
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,479
[Ms. Tu, please take

756
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,400
[this small gift.]

757
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,999
This is

758
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,120
expensive.

759
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,439
Xiaoning.

760
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,759
This...

761
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,439
Hello?

762
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,919
Hello, Mr. Fu.

763
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:12,999
How's the gift?

764
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,160
You like it?

765
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,479
I'm sorry,

766
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,759
but it's too expensive for me

767
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,479
to take it.

768
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,800
How about this?

769
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:20,959
If it's convenient for you,

770
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,560
should I send it to you now

771
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,199
or by courier?

772
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,959
[If you really want to thank me,]

773
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,439
[buy me dinner.]

774
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,880
[We'd better set a time now.]

775
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:31,880
[How about tonight?]

776
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:32,919
Okay.

777
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,279
So,

778
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,679
which restaurant do you like?

779
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,199
There's a nice Japanese restaurant

780
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,080
near your bank.

781
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,360
Okay.

782
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,640
I'll see you at 7:00 p.m.

783
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,759
At Kikukawa.

784
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:42,800
Okay.

785
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,439
See you tonight.

786
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:44,800
Bye.

787
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,080
I'll give it back

788
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,759
to him later.

789
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,560
Go back to your work.

790
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,759
Be careful.

791
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,400
Thank you for helping me

792
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,320
with the business dinner

793
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,800
despite your pregnancy sickness.

794
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,199
It's okay.

795
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:08,080
In public, I'm your superior.

796
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,999
This is my job.

797
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,120
In private,

798
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,479
I'm your mentor.

799
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,279
Just in case

800
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,360
that Mr. Fu

801
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,600
tries to do something

802
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,080
improper to you.

803
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:17,919
I can't stand by

804
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,759
while you're in danger.

805
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,120
Thank you so much.

806
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:20,759
Let's go.

807
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:21,279
Go.

808
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,199
Come on in.

809
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:33,719
Be careful.

810
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,320
Good evening.

811
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,759
Mr. Fu.

812
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Let me introduce.

813
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:37,840
This is

814
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,040
Ms. Rao from S1 of BDD,

815
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,279
my higher authority.

816
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,840
Nice to meet you, Ms. Rao.

817
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:42,999
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fu.

818
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,400
You didn't

819
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,519
tell me in advance.

820
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,239
So the room I booked

821
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,120
probably won't seat three.

822
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,519
Well, then...

823
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,080
I think...

824
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,919
What a coincidence.

825
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,439
I booked a room for four.

826
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,719
How about we eat together?

827
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
Are you okay, Jing?

828
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,199
Sorry.

829
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,999
If you're

830
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,640
really uncomfortable,

831
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,999
you can go home.

832
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,919
Sorry, Mr. Fu.

833
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,120
I didn't expect

834
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,439
pregnancy can be

835
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,439
such a mess.

836
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,320
It's okay, Jing.

837
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,999
You don't have to stay if you're not well.

838
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,320
Mr. Fu

839
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,400
is magnanimous.

840
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,360
He can understand.

841
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,479
I'm here now.

842
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,640
I won't

843
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:35,679
let Xiaoning drink too much.

844
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:36,439
Don't worry.

845
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:39,999
Okay.

846
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,199
Xiaoning,

847
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,679
please

848
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,040
take care of Mr. Fu.

849
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,880
I'm so sorry, Mr. Fu.

850
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,320
I'll buy you dinner next time.

851
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,320
It's okay.

852
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,199
I'm really sorry.

853
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,120
I'll leave you then.

854
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,320
I'll see you off.

855
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,800
No need.

856
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,320
Stay.

857
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:52,120
Okay.

858
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,999
Be safe, then.

859
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,679
Okay.

860
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,560
I'm off.

861
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:01,880
Make yourselves at home.

862
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:02,800
Let's talk about it over dinner.

863
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:03,479
Okay.

864
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:03,840
Let's eat.

865
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,080
Try this.

866
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,519
Thank you.

867
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,439
I've heard about

868
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,320
the proposal of Ji'an branch.

869
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,560
Didn't expect

870
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,800
the president is so young.

871
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,279
I've stayed abroad too long

872
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,160
to know much

873
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,519
about the situation.

874
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,080
But a lot of talent has emerged

875
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,360
at home in the last few years.

876
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,919
I dare not believe that

877
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,840
Mr. Fu is impressed with

878
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,959
the proposal

879
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,840
at Ji'an branch.

880
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,279
From the written proposal,

881
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:38,320
Dairui is offering

882
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,400
the best deal

883
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,999
of any bank in town.

884
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,800
And

885
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,040
our branch should be

886
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,719
the most suitable for Mr. Fu

887
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,080
in terms of the way it operates.

888
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,840
Aren't you so clever?

889
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,959
Sorry.

890
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,199
Sorry.

891
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,199
Too much wasabi.

892
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:21,320
Sorry. Sorry.

893
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,199
-Here.
-Sorry.

894
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:24,600
Sorry.

895
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,759
This one's for you.

896
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,040
Looks like you

897
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,800
knows your colleagues well.

898
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,560
Know people well and appoint them well.

899
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,719
No wonder you're excellent in business.

900
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,160
Actually, I don't know many people.

901
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,199
Xiaoning

902
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,279
is an exception.

903
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,479
Though you know her,

904
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,759
you still don't know

905
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,919
what tricks she used

906
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,880
in the proposal.

907
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,880
I don't need to know.

908
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,719
Dairui is offering

909
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,160
the best deal in town.

910
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,320
But all things being equal,

911
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,519
the proposal that Ji'an can offer

912
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,080
is the best in all branches of Dairui.

913
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:03,999
So,

914
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:04,800
what's your offer?

915
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,719
Mr. Fu has read the proposal.

916
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,999
He knows.

917
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:13,519
He did make a better offer

918
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,999
than you did.

919
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,719
But in my opinion,

920
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:18,959
banks and corporations

921
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,919
work together, just like normal business.

922
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,400
Fate and

923
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,600
friendship matter.

924
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:23,959
Both of them

925
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,479
are indispensable.

926
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,199
[You're correct.]

927
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,840
[Here's a toast to you.]

928
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:34,999
Long-term cooperation is based

929
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,519
on the exchange of benefits

930
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,120
and mutual trust

931
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,640
in all kinds of business.

932
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,360
Mutual Benefits

933
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,160
for a Win-Win situation.

934
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,040
Don't you think so?

935
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,400
We both toast to you.

936
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:10,679
It's against

937
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,679
our bank's code.

938
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,320
Thank you,

939
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,279
but I really can't take it.

940
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:15,679
So I give it back to you.

941
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:19,479
It's okay.

942
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,959
There's still time.

943
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,239
Mr. Ji,

944
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,199
I'll leave now.

945
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:25,759
Looking forward to our cooperation.

946
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,040
So?

947
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,400
Going back to work this late?

948
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:48,880
I'm going home.

949
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,400
I take my car,

950
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,120
you take yours.

951
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,320
Don't follow.

952
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,519
Mr. Ji.

953
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
You were blatantly

954
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,880
stealing clients

955
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,759
from me.

956
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Wasn't it too much?

957
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,160
I just ran into you

958
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,040
and had a

959
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,279
casual chat with him.

960
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,080
Besides, if I hadn't been there,

961
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,320
you would

962
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,519
have suffered from

963
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,360
Mr. Fu's gaze

964
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
after Rao Jing feeling

965
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,360
uncomfortable and leaving.

966
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,160
He's just my client.

967
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,439
The luxury gift.

968
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:35,600
Private room for only two.

969
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,120
I don't think this Mr. Fu was

970
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,040
satisfied just to be your client.

971
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,800
Xiaoning.

972
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,360
Are you jealous?

973
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:43,320
Yeah.

974
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,719
But I care more about your safety.

975
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,959
Don't use jealousy as a cover.

976
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,360
Don't think I'm going to

977
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,239
let my guard down

978
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,080
because of

979
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,919
your affection.

980
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:55,919
You can always let your guard down on me.

981
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,679
But not

982
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,320
on others.

983
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,519
Bank lenders

984
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,360
must have their own bottom line.

985
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,439
We need to have

986
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,959
risk control over our clients,

987
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,400
while at the same time

988
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,800
taking the initiative ourselves.

989
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,360
Once we have some

990
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,160
concessions at the beginning,

991
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,080
the clients will take control

992
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,959
and ask more.

993
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,759
It's going to be very hard

994
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,479
to regain control again

995
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,560
at that time.

996
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,120
Mr. Ji,

997
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:23,239
thanks for reminding me.

998
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,080
Losing one or two clients

999
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,719
won't put Dairui out of business,

1000
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,919
nor let it go bankrupt.

1001
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,880
But for me,

1002
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,519
a little

1003
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,400
account manager,

1004
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,719
it means a lot more.

1005
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,719
Each client is a result of

1006
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,120
patient communication,

1007
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,279
careful management,

1008
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,840
and hard work of mine.

1009
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,279
I won't let anyone

1010
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
take them from me.

1011
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,959
But you're mine.

1012
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,679
I won't let anyone

1013
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,719
take you from me.

1014
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:47,959
Don't worry.

1015
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,320
I'm not a

1016
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,040
damsel in distress

1017
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,800
when it comes to them,

1018
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,519
nor a cunning woman using

1019
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,840
intimacy to get what I want,

1020
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,479
nor a coward giving up

1021
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,880
a client because of

1022
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,479
baseless gossip.

1023
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,999
I'm a grown-up with a brain.

1024
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,320
I know what to do when facing

1025
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,759
unwanted intimacy.

1026
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,439
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked Jing

1027
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,719
to come with me.

1028
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,959
Is that

1029
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,959
a relief for you?

1030
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay.

1031
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,440
Did you tell Rao Jing

1032
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,000
to take your annual leave?

1033
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,399
When is your vacation?

1034
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,120
I'll make the plans.

1035
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,759
Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, I guess.

1036
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,160
Okay.

1037
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,160
How did you know we were

1038
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,879
having dinner there today?

1039
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:42,719
Who told you?

1040
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:46,520
No comment?

1041
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,560
Okay.

1042
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,359
Question two.

1043
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,359
What's your proposal?

1044
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,239
We're in the same bank.

1045
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,120
There shouldn't be too much

1046
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
of a difference in the terms offered.

1047
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:04,040
You have to answer

1048
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,520
one of these two questions.

1049
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,399
Choose.

1050
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:13,960
It's Li Xiang.

1051
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Traitor.

1052
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,560
How dare him.

1053
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,040
[Mr. Ji.]

1054
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
[Would it be convenient tomorrow]

1055
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,480
[to bring the ring and]

1056
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,359
[the token doll you mentioned?]

1057
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,759
[We'll be working]

1058
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:42,960
[with some special setups.]

1059
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:44,920
[Okay.]

1060
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:22,359
Xiaoning.

1061
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,679
You've got good fortune.

1062
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Your gifts are getting even more lavish.

1063
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,080
Lang.

1064
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,279
How can you say that?

1065
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,440
Xiaoning has

1066
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,480
returned the gift yesterday.

1067
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,279
We're not allowed

1068
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,239
to take gifts from clients.

1069
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,199
Then

1070
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,640
who gave her this gift?

1071
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,920
It must be her boyfriend.

1072
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,000
Li Xiang.

1073
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,480
Should I

1074
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,879
hold it

1075
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,799
with a surprised face,

1076
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:48,120
and you take a picture of me

1077
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,399
as proof of merit?

1078
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,440
Of course, I...

1079
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,920
Mr. Ji told you?

1080
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,679
Well, I...

1081
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:59,239
You're really going to take the pic?

1082
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,000
I may tell Jing that

1083
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,040
you're a traitor.

1084
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:02,719
[I,]

1085
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:04,719
no,

1086
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,040
Xiaoning,

1087
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,239
don't tell Ms. Jing!

1088
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,600
She would kill me!

1089
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,440
I know.

1090
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,399
I'm always on Section One's side

1091
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,199
when it comes to principles.

1092
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,759
I swear I'd never betray.

1093
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,160
Yeah, I know.

1094
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,359
But in the future,

1095
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,239
if you have to be a traitor,

1096
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,399
you can work for me.

1097
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,120
Okay.

1098
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,879
What are you looking at?

1099
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:22,319
Go back to your work!

1100
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,839
[Is this the strange]

1101
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,199
[competitive nature of men?]

1102
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,520
[Do you like it?]

1103
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:43,239
Naive.

1104
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:07,960
Hello, Xiaoning.

1105
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,000
Are you busy now?

1106
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:10,399
Do you want to have lunch together?

1107
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,759
The business with Mr. Fu

1108
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,359
works very well,

1109
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,600
[so I plan to]

1110
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,440
[go to see him this afternoon]

1111
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,319
[in his office]

1112
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
to check with the proposal.

1113
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:22,000
Sorry I can't join you for lunch.

1114
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,480
You have

1115
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:24,560
a light lunch.

1116
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,759
We'll have dinner together.

1117
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:33,719
Come on in.

1118
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,839
Time for takeout.

1119
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,319
Two takeouts for free delivery.

1120
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,160
Any progress

1121
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,319
this morning with Mr. Fu?

1122
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,359
I contacted him this morning.

1123
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,399
He's still interested

1124
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,359
in our rates.

1125
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,560
I'll keep an eye on it this afternoon.

1126
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,679
You get some rest

1127
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,839
this afternoon.

1128
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,960
Leave it to me.

1129
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,120
I'll skip lunch.

1130
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,040
Don't skip lunch!

1131
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,080
You've lost weight lately.

1132
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,319
Mr. Zhou.

1133
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,160
I'll be there in ten minutes.

1134
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:14,560
[Right.]

1135
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,080
[Drive carefully then.]

1136
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,520
I'll meet you at the gate.

1137
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,080
You'll be with us all day long

1138
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,359
on today's field trip, won't you?

1139
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,359
[Yes.]

1140
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:24,799
Okay, see you.

1141
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,920
[See you.]

1142
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,040
Ms. Tu.

1143
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,600
Here's the revised contract.

1144
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,759
Thank you.

1145
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,520
If you have no

1146
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,879
further questions,

1147
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,399
I'll go back and get ready to

1148
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,040
formalize the contract.

1149
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,040
I'll see you tomorrow for a signature.

1150
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,839
Is that okay with you?

1151
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,040
Mr. Zhou.

1152
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,199
It's out of tea.

1153
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,359
Okay.

1154
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:07,160
Thank you.

1155
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,480
Check it.

1156
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,839
To be honest,

1157
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,839
it's not easy to

1158
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,560
get a coffee lover

1159
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:32,920
to run a tea factory.

1160
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,080
[I'm sure you've heard about it.]

1161
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,160
[Until I returned home, Youpin]

1162
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,480
[had been run by my brother-in-law.]

1163
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,759
It wasn't until recently

1164
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,359
that it was returned to me

1165
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,319
at the behest of my father.

1166
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,000
My brother-in-law

1167
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,719
took a lot of old staff

1168
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,679
with him when he left,

1169
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,600
including our

1170
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,879
veteran financier.

1171
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,759
Youpin needs to expand,

1172
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,160
but it needs money first,

1173
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,679
and someone

1174
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,040
to take care of finance.

1175
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,520
I need someone I can trust,

1176
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,679
with Mr. Zhou,

1177
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,679
to keep the finance department afloat.

1178
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:05,799
Xiaoning,

1179
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,759
I think you're perfect for it.

1180
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,839
I did see

1181
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:14,560
the generous

1182
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,679
offer you have

1183
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,480
made me.

1184
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:18,839
But

1185
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,679
I do my current job

1186
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:22,000
not just for salary.

1187
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,239
I love it.

1188
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,520
So I have to apologize.

1189
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,520
I have no intention of resigning.

1190
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,080
Xiaoning.

1191
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:31,120
You're a smart girl.

1192
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,759
You know

1193
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,199
why I chose you

1194
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,000
over a better

1195
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,279
proposal.

1196
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,879
The gift.

1197
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,799
Dinner.

1198
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,279
The revision is easy,

1199
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:42,799
but I had to call you in.

1200
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,679
Are my hints not obvious

1201
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:47,279
enough to you?

1202
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,319
Well, then I'll just have to be clear.

1203
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,120
And the veil too.

1204
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,040
Just the simple one

1205
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,759
that girls love.

1206
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,040
Yes.

1207
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:20,839
I need it a bit of formal.

1208
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,879
I'll tell you the rest of

1209
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,319
the wedding proposal later.

1210
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,879
Okay.

1211
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:05,920
Don't look! Don't look!

1212
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,279
Don't look!

1213
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:07,879
What are you doing, Ji Yuheng?

1214
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,960
You're taking advantage of me?

1215
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,160
Taking advantage of you?

1216
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,520
What am I taking advantage for?

1217
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,480
For work, of course.

1218
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,600
In life,

1219
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:18,679
it's me who takes advantage.

1220
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,199
We're

1221
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,359
so close in life.

1222
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
It's not a big deal if you take a tiny loss.

1223
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:25,520
Sometimes, loss is a blessing.

1224
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,199
Then I wish you to be blessed forever.

1225
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,199
Well, I have to say,

1226
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,319
same to you.

1227
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:36,399
I've seen it.

1228
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,759
You have?

1229
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,679
Ji Yuheng, you've seen it!
