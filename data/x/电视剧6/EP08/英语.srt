00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,120
You Are My Secret EP08

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Nice work!

4
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,920
Renji Hospital is a big client.

5
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,920
Bank of Xinfa

6
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
had their payroll for ages,

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,879
and you managed to steal it from them.

8
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,759
Impressive!

9
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:57,920
I'm telling you,

10
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,319
if a client can be stolen,

11
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:01,200
they're never

12
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,360
really loyal to the other bank.

13
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,239
And

14
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,160
once a client is with me,

15
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,920
they won't leave.

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,160
So confident!

17
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,679
Congrats, Jing.

18
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,160
Congrats, Ms. Rao.

19
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
It's really a case

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,200
of the rich getting richer.

21
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,759
Your year-end bonus is probably

22
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,240
more than all of ours combined.

23
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,840
As for me,

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm being targeted by our leader,

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,000
and I still have

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,120
a bad loan to deal with.

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,879
I was hoping for a raise

28
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,599
at the end of the year

29
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,759
for some extra pocket money.

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,079
But... Xiaoning,

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,479
no luck at all.

32
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,799
Speaking of the bad loan,

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,840
how's it going?

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,359
Waiting to deal with the collateral.

35
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:45,560
Wasn't a third-party

36
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,240
guarantee added?

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,599
They don't wanna sell the collateral?

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
A commercial building in a remote area...

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,720
Who would buy it?

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,479
What do you say?

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,440
Once it fails

42
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,160
to sell at auction,

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,039
the value drops.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,199
30,000,000 yuan in bad loans...

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,560
I'm doomed.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,919
I just hope

47
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,199
some kind soul

48
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,000
will save me.

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
God bless.

50
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,400
Ms. Rao,

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,160
Mr. Zhao,

52
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,000
let's have

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,039
dinner tonight.

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,120
No problem.

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,160
Sorry, Mr. Ji,

56
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,759
tonight...

57
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:16,319
Xiaoning,

58
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,520
you join us too.

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Afterwards, you can drive us.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,319
Okay.

61
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:21,120
Thanks.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,759
Aren't you coming?

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
Mr. Ji is too stingy.

64
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,199
Inviting clients to dinner,

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,160
and he didn't choose

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,199
a classy Western restaurant

67
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:41,879
or at least

68
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,240
a decent private kitchen.

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,440
You're usually tight-fisted,

70
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,000
suddenly become

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
generous when someone else

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,440
is footing the bill.

73
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,759
No matter who the guest is,

74
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,479
clients need

75
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,359
to feel valued.

76
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,039
Is this place

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,199
up to the mark?

78
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,799
I think it's fine.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,960
Mr. Ji must have

80
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,440
his reasons for choosing it.

81
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:00,919
Reasons?

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,960
The only reason

83
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,079
is that he's from Compliance Dept,

84
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,280
always putting on airs.

85
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,879
But fine,

86
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,479
I'll take this opportunity to see

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,240
how this business outsider

88
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:10,479
talks about business.

89
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,879
Isn't that Mr. Jiang

90
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,560
from the Tech Park?

91
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,840
I thought he never socialized.

92
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,479
So,

93
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,919
you should observe and learn today.

94
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,439
Yuheng,

95
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,520
you picked a great place

96
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
for dinner.

97
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
The environment

98
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,280
is elegant and simple,

99
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,559
and the dishes

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,400
are affordable and tasty.

101
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:42,559
Your down-to-earth

102
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,840
and unpretentious work attitude

103
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,559
is something everyone

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,840
should learn from.

105
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,880
As long as you're satisfied.

106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,720
I am.

107
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,559
Mr. Jiang,

108
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,039
I'd like to introduce myself.

109
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm Rao Jing,

110
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,799
a senior client manager.

111
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:55,880
Let me toast to you.

112
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:56,479
Cheers.

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
A good leader can make a good team.

114
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,119
One more, please.

115
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:01,919
Mr. Jiang,

116
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:03,200
please

117
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,999
allow me to introduce myself.

118
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm Zhao Fanggang,

119
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
a senior client manager

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,960
at Dairui.

121
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,679
I wanna propose a toast

122
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:09,520
to you,

123
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,239
and Mr. Ji.

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,559
He's so kind for inviting us,

125
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:13,359
so we have

126
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,720
the honor of meeting you.

127
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:16,400
I'll down my drink.

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,039
You can drink at your pace.

129
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:17,720
You flatter me.

130
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,039
Xiaoning.

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,880
You still have high alcohol tolerance.

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,599
Xiaoning is our assistant

133
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,400
on the business side.

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,799
She's driving today,

135
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:30,720
so we won't let her drink.

136
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,479
Put it down.

137
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,799
Actually,

138
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:34,599
we don't encourage

139
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,080
forced drinking at the table.

140
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,039
Alcohol

141
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,919
or juice,

142
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:39,760
as you like.

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,280
I will

144
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,720
toast you with tea.

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
It's an honor to meet you.

146
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,200
I'll do the same.

147
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:45,919
Nice

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
to meet you.

149
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:49,960
Here,

150
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:51,400
try these dishes.

151
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,520
No matter how busy work is,

152
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
health comes first.

153
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,880
Indeed.

154
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,799
I heard that

155
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,239
you're responsible not only for planning,

156
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,320
but for

157
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,799
attracting investment

158
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,679
for the entire park.

159
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,960
Did your teacher tell you that?

160
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:05,439
Yes.

161
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,439
Honestly,

162
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,039
I have a headache about this.

163
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:10,760
Especially about

164
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,799
suitable office spaces

165
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,200
for those large

166
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,160
manufacturing companies, right?

167
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,039
How well-informed you are!

168
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,080
You even know about this.

169
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,280
To be frank,

170
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,039
Mr. Zhao has

171
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,359
two amazing

172
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,080
commercial buildings,

173
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:25,880
and we can offer them

174
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,840
to you for free.

175
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,679
This sounds

176
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,960
like a

177
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,359
losing deal.

178
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,840
Besides,

179
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,799
we can also solve

180
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,320
the settlement issues for

181
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
small enterprises in the Park.

182
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,359
But I have to

183
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,640
hand over the loan business

184
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,280
of those enterprises

185
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,919
to Dairui, right?

186
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Exactly.

187
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,720
Given the scale

188
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,439
of the Park,

189
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,799
it's indeed a big piece of cake,

190
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,119
and

191
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,160
several banks

192
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,840
have contacted me

193
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,840
recently.

194
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,119
But I believe,

195
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,599
you also know that

196
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,359
large companies look at the big picture,

197
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
while small ones

198
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,919
need practical and hands-on services.

199
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,400
In terms of

200
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,720
overall strength,

201
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,080
Dairui might not

202
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,840
compare to big banks,

203
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,119
but it has absolute advantages

204
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,239
in real-world operations.

205
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,200
That's right.

206
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,679
Mr. Ji hit the nail on the head.

207
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,359
We previously provided similar

208
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,160
financial services to the investment

209
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
promotion office in Tong County,

210
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,559
so we've already

211
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,880
developed a highly

212
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,520
efficient process.

213
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,320
Our cooperation can promote

214
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,640
the landing

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,039
of investment industries.

216
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,720
It can also solve problems

217
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,799
for small businesses in the future.

218
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,559
A win-win-win.

219
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:43,919
Mr. Jiang,

220
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,999
a toast to you.

221
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,720
Wait a moment.

222
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,359
I didn't expect you young people

223
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,799
to be so insightful

224
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,720
and forward-thinking.

225
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:55,400
Alright,

226
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,760
come to my office another day.

227
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:00,960
Sure,

228
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,320
looking forward to our cooperation.

229
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,119
- Cheers. - Cheers.

230
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,679
Cheers.

231
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,239
To a bright future.

232
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,760
To be honest,

233
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,720
I get drunk easily,

234
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,039
but we're having

235
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,200
too much fun today.

236
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,160
Mr. Jiang,

237
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,280
you drink this much,

238
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,200
and I'll drink a whole glass.

239
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,320
I'll drink first

240
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,799
to show my respect.

241
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,840
I'll have this drink

242
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,960
with Mr. Jiang.

243
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,320
Cheers.

244
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,239
Mr. Zhao is also

245
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,039
kinda drinker.

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,280
Cool.

247
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
Come here, Mr. Zhao.

248
00:08:59,319 --> 00:08:59,799
Mr. Jiang,

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,559
your phone's ringing.

250
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,240
Okay.

251
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,400
I'm here.

252
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,959
Hello?

253
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,520
Yes,

254
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,679
Zhongshan Road.

255
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,959
I'll send you the location.

256
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,039
Ji Yuheng?

257
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,120
Ji Yuheng,

258
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,079
are you alright?

259
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,039
I'm fine.

260
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,240
Okay.

261
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,439
My car's here.

262
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,120
All right,

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,719
I'll see you off.

264
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,039
I...

265
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,160
suddenly realized

266
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,280
that something hasn't been confirmed.

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,400
What is it?

268
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,079
The free use of the

269
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,400
commercial buildings you mentioned,

270
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,839
are there any conditions?

271
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:47,959
Yes,

272
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,120
the loan amount

273
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,959
must meet our requirements.

274
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,400
Based on

275
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,760
the auction standards,

276
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:55,559
well,

277
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,480
I suggest

278
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:57,439
buying it

279
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,319
as it's more cost-effective.

280
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,000
Ji Yuheng,

281
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:05,000
you're slicker than you're in school.

282
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,400
In the end, you still come out on top.

283
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,039
Fine,

284
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,880
see you at Dairui.

285
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,919
It's a deal.

286
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:10,719
See you there.

287
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,199
C'mon,

288
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,360
let me see you out.

289
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,319
Take care.

290
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,959
Go.

291
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,120
Why

292
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,719
did you suddenly...

293
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,280
Suddenly what?

294
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:33,600
Just...

295
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm drunk.

296
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,640
You seem quite sober to me.

297
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,039
You even know the loan standards,

298
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,919
the auction standards,

299
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,600
and how to make it

300
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,000
more cost-effective for Dairui.

301
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,760
Are you suggesting I planned them all?

302
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,919
Helping Fanggang make connections

303
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,000
and deal with auctioned properties,

304
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,600
that was part of your plan, right?

305
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,880
I feel a bit tipsy

306
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:04,280
from the breeze.

307
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:08,760
Let's go home.

308
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
Are you kidding?

309
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:12,919
Thanks to you,

310
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,120
I have to drive them away.

311
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,799
Has Mr. Jiang left?

312
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,079
Yes, Jing.

313
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,039
I noticed Mr. Ji drank quite a bit.

314
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,120
You should take him home first.

315
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,559
No need.

316
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,160
He just said

317
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
he wanna walk alone

318
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,799
to sober up.

319
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:28,319
I'll take you first.

320
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,240
Right, Mr. Ji?

321
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,160
Why didn't you say you're leaving?

322
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,319
The room is empty now.

323
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,480
Where's Mr. Jiang?

324
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,360
He left.

325
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,199
I'm leaving now.

326
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,199
Let's go, Fanggang.

327
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,280
Be safe.

328
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:38,880
Let's go.

329
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,600
Take it slow.

330
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,319
Okay, thanks.

331
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,679
Breathe quieter, will you?

332
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,160
I really don't get it.

333
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,160
What is Ji Yuheng

334
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,319
up to?

335
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,439
A slap on the wrist and a candy?

336
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,919
Sugar-coated bullets?

337
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,559
Always saying

338
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,319
it's a fight to the death,

339
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,280
but I saw you

340
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,319
cooperating well at the dinner table.

341
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,959
Work is work.

342
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,280
I can be professional.

343
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:23,600
But

344
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,319
what's his game

345
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,160
with the collateral?

346
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,880
Always scheming

347
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,679
and forming

348
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,480
cliques in

349
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,719
the office,

350
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,799
but now

351
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,000
you can't

352
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
figure this out?

353
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,160
By all accounts,

354
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,559
he should be at odds with me.

355
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,559
Why would he help me?

356
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:45,880
Fanggang,

357
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,360
I think

358
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:48,799
Mr. Ji wants to

359
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,600
turn enemies into friends.

360
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,919
It's like

361
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,480
extending an olive branch.

362
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,280
Pardon?

363
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,799
If it's real,

364
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,959
I would write my name backward.

365
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,719
Even if he tries,

366
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,719
I'll still see him as an enemy.

367
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,559
Here we go again.

368
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,039
You were always

369
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,039
badmouthing him

370
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,319
to me,

371
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,120
and now after one kind gesture,

372
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,959
you're just

373
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:10,839
so lost.

374
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:12,799
Can you speak properly?

375
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,880
I just helped you block some drinks.

376
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,799
Do I need it?

377
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,079
With your drinking capacity?

378
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,240
Please...

379
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,360
C'mon, what's that?

380
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,880
You plan

381
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,000
to drop the feud

382
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,079
and make peace?

383
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,799
I've never had a grudge against you.

384
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,919
We're in healthy competition.

385
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,880
No matter

386
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,959
how we compete,

387
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,880
it is

388
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,439
still an

389
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,400
internal matter.

390
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:41,959
Against

391
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:42,919
outsiders,

392
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,559
we should stand united.

393
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,240
Stop that.

394
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,679
Letting you sit in the back

395
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,559
was me being nice.

396
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,079
If you keep breathing loudly,

397
00:14:59,079 --> 00:14:59,799
sit in the front.

398
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,719
Hi, Mr. Ji,

399
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:19,559
how's the hangover?

400
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,400
Didn't you say we're going separate ways?

401
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,319
Get in the car.

402
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:31,120
Let's go.

403
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,480
Well...

404
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,719
I made this for you.

405
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,880
Honey water, good for hangovers.

406
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,880
My experience tells me

407
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,600
it works.

408
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,439
Drink it.

409
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:51,880
Why are you back?

410
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,039
I dropped them off at the subway

411
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,480
and thought

412
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
it was too sad

413
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,199
to leave

414
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,280
you alone.

415
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:00,880
Plus,

416
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,400
if a handsome man

417
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,799
like you fell drunk

418
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,400
on the roadside

419
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,839
and caused some trouble,

420
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,280
wouldn't that be a loss for me?

421
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:09,959
It is sweet.

422
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,520
But don't worry,

423
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,000
you know,

424
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,280
with family at home,

425
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,679
I won't be

426
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,559
passing out outside.

427
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,439
Mainly because

428
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,039
you were good today,

429
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
trying to ease things with Fanggang.

430
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,799
You showed

431
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,480
a bit of humanity.

432
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,079
I couldn't

433
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,600
leave you by the roadside.

434
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,919
Sounds

435
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,719
like a praise.

436
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:36,799
Just words

437
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,400
for that?

438
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,959
Didn't I come back to pick you up?

439
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,839
What more do you want?

440
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,079
You seem to be in a good mood.

441
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,079
How fancy bathing in the sea breeze

442
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,160
with ice cream

443
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,919
in hand!

444
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:03,360
Of course,

445
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,039
you made me happy too.

446
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,679
Tell me more.

447
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,039
You've resolved your issues

448
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,679
with Fanggang,

449
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,480
so I no longer

450
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,520
have to walk on eggshells

451
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:13,760
between you two.

452
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,679
Mr. Ji,

453
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,079
you've really improved a lot

454
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,120
under my guidance.

455
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:19,999
That's true.

456
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,999
You admit that so quickly.

457
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,279
Because what you said

458
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,800
makes sense.

459
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,080
I'm just an ordinary person

460
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,160
with

461
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
various flaws

462
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,239
and shortcomings.

463
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,719
Actually, I'm quite happy

464
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,840
that you can

465
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,679
remind me of them

466
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:39,719
in my life.

467
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,999
It's really great that

468
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,479
you can change so quickly,

469
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,479
follow through with your words,

470
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,600
recognize your issues,

471
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,600
and also

472
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,719
correct them.

473
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,999
But I still need

474
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,360
to thank you for guiding me.

475
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,560
Should I

476
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,600
become a life coach?

477
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:57,400
Staying at Dairui is a waste.

478
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,679
Why aren't you eating?

479
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,959
It's winter.

480
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Don't you think it's too cold?

481
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,400
Not at all.

482
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,519
Winter is

483
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,400
the best time for ice cream.

484
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,679
It doesn't

485
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,919
melt quickly,

486
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,959
so you can enjoy it slowly.

487
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,719
If you don't want it,

488
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,999
give it to me.

489
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,040
No.

490
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:18,919
C'mon.

491
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,160
I said no.

492
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:20,840
I'll eat it for you.

493
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,880
Why eat mine?

494
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,239
Yours tastes better.

495
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:41,400
Your mouth

496
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
is covered in it

497
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,360
like a child.

498
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,040
What are you doing?

499
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
The winter sea

500
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:26,519
is cold.

501
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,959
Put me down.

502
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,919
The moonlight

503
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:23,800
is beautiful tonight.

504
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,679
The sound of the waves is soothing,

505
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:28,479
and my heartbeat

506
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:29,800
is loud.

507
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,719
This is against the rules.

508
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,239
Well...

509
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,400
Good morning.

510
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,360
Hi, Xiaoning.

511
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,759
These flowers aren't cheap.

512
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,279
Such a big bouquet, it's beautiful.

513
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,199
Yeah.

514
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:05,479
Who sent them?

515
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,160
Although you're in different depts,

516
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
flaunting

517
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,919
your relationship

518
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
can make others jealous.

519
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,199
What?

520
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,199
Who are you referring to?

521
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,320
C'mon,

522
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,959
Qi Yu, of course.

523
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,679
They're

524
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,439
pretty.

525
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,600
Take care of them.

526
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,400
I drank too much last night.

527
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,080
I still have a hangover.

528
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,679
Fanggang!

529
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,519
Don't mismatch us.

530
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:29,840
Who sent them?

531
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,120
There's not even a note.

532
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,560
Are those flowers from Ji Yuheng?

533
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,600
Probably.

534
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,519
You kept complaining

535
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,679
about him the other day

536
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,679
'cause he didn't talk

537
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:03,640
to people nicely.

538
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Women are so unpredictable.

539
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,120
Aren't you the same?

540
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,560
What about the other night?

541
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,279
After the party,

542
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,199
did Qi Yu wait

543
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,239
at your doorstep all night?

544
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,640
How did you feel?

545
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,840
Did it pull your heartstrings?

546
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,919
Qi Yu and Ji Yuheng

547
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
are not the same.

548
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,160
For Ji Yuheng,

549
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,519
his flaws

550
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,479
are like tiny ripples,

551
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,279
while Qi Yu's

552
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:29,959
huge wave

553
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,600
almost capsized

554
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,400
the boat of my life.

555
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,160
You don't share

556
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,040
any common memories

557
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,320
from the past,

558
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,160
good or bad.

559
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:39,959
Unlike us...

560
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,320
Alright.

561
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,320
There's no point in talking about it.

562
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:44,840
Well,

563
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:45,600
stop being upset.

564
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:46,840
You have me by your side.

565
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,160
We have a great past,

566
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,279
and also a better future.

567
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:50,840
You can always

568
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,800
lay on my chest.

569
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,479
Up yours.

570
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:53,959
I just want

571
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,439
the chest of cool boys.

572
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,479
How honest you are!

573
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,160
Okay, Mr. Shen.

574
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:22,840
I'll wait until

575
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,439
you're free.

576
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:25,959
Okay.

577
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,360
We'll talk later.

578
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,479
Okay.

579
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,719
What's about the smile?

580
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,239
Nothing.

581
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,560
Do you want something?

582
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:31,840
Get your stuff.

583
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,080
Come with me to Renji Hospital.

584
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,679
Okay.

585
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,600
In a minute.

586
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,239
Hurry up.

587
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,279
Do you know the process of

588
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:43,840
starting payroll service?

589
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,120
Yes. I've just learned.

590
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,199
That's not hard.

591
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,400
The hard part is to recommend

592
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,439
our financial products

593
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:49,999
and credit cards.

594
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,840
I'll do all of them?

595
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:54,320
Can you?

596
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,479
Yes!

597
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:56,840
I'll do my best.

598
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,120
You took me into

599
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,800
business before,

600
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,840
but you said

601
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:02,840
I wasn't good enough.

602
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,959
You've made some progress

603
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:06,560
in your business lately.

604
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,800
It's about time

605
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,919
you practiced.

606
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,160
Besides, the process of

607
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,239
payroll service is trivial.

608
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,120
I can't do it all by myself.

609
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:15,919
I'll go up and

610
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,120
have a word with the CFO.

611
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,040
You go straight to the sixth floor.

612
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,880
They keep an office

613
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,719
for us there.

614
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,600
Start the payroll service first.

615
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:21,560
Okay.

616
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,320
I don't think

617
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
it's from

618
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,519
the driver

619
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,560
named Qi Yu.

620
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,120
He looks too dull.

621
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,160
Fanggang.

622
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,239
What do you say?

623
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,080
There's

624
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,719
a romantic soul

625
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,400
underneath the rustic appearance.

626
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,120
Do you understand "romantic"?

627
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,479
Well,

628
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,880
I'm sorry for Xiaoning.

629
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,880
She deserves

630
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,080
a better man.

631
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:45,600
Yes.

632
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,199
The registration is almost finished.

633
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,239
May I have

634
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,279
your attention please?

635
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Please have a look

636
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,919
at the brochure about credit card.

637
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,239
It's an add-on

638
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,679
service to the payroll card.

639
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,479
All doctors and nurses

640
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,679
at this hospital

641
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,320
who apply for this

642
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,679
can enjoy a limit

643
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,560
of over 50,000 yuan.

644
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,279
You can use the payroll card

645
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,600
to pay off the credit card

646
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,919
directly every month

647
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,840
without any fee.

648
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,759
It's a good deal.

649
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,999
That's convenient.

650
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,719
But I don't think another card

651
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,759
is necessary.

652
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,840
He's right.

653
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,160
How about

654
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,080
you just register?

655
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,759
You can get a trolley case

656
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,759
and supermarket membership

657
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,600
for today.

658
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,759
A trolley case?

659
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,519
And supermarket membership?

660
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:42,800
I need one.

661
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,160
Sijing.

662
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,719
Didn't realize

663
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
you could need a credit card.

664
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:51,160
Of course I need it.

665
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,279
There's a lot of bills.

666
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:53,320
How about you?

667
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,320
But...

668
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,120
I don't think

669
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,880
it's of use.

670
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,519
C'mon. It's of great use.

671
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,719
It can help you get a discount

672
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,919
on dinner on Wednesdays

673
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:01,759
and double points to redeem

674
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,600
movie tickets on Fridays.

675
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
You can save your boyfriend money on dates.

676
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,239
Stop making fun of me.

677
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,880
How do you know it so much?

678
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,679
Didn't you just come back from abroad?

679
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,679
Stop asking.

680
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,360
Start registering.

681
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,519
C'mon, everybody!

682
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:19,919
Xiaoning.

683
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,959
I can get

684
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,800
a free trolley case, right?

685
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,360
Yes.

686
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:23,840
Here.

687
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:24,719
Here.

688
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:26,999
Jing.

689
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,040
Where's your work permit?

690
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,040
Here.

691
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,199
Remember to wear it

692
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,160
when doing business.

693
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:33,999
How's it going?

694
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,080
I almost finished the

695
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,919
payroll service registration.

696
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,800
But I don't think

697
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,400
they're interested in credit cards.

698
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,759
I saw that doctor

699
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,160
warming up to you.

700
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:45,800
Any stories about you two?

701
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,199
Um...

702
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,400
Your ex?

703
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,320
Look at this.

704
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,880
Here.

705
00:27:59,239 --> 00:27:59,640
Take it.

706
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:02,919
It's actually a business

707
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,759
that every bank is striving for.

708
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:05,840
He's popular.

709
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,040
People love to listen to him.

710
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,320
Make good use of it.

711
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,519
Jing.

712
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:10,320
I don't want too much

713
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,360
contact with him.

714
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,679
I don't want his help with my work.

715
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,239
You're just doing your job.

716
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,040
Every help counts.

717
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,479
It's just a small favor

718
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:17,519
from him.

719
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,279
If they didn't get credit cards today,

720
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,080
other banks would take

721
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,439
the chance away from us tomorrow.

722
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,479
You do marketing.

723
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,800
You need to open your mind

724
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,279
to all possible resources

725
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,320
around you.

726
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,040
So, none

727
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,959
of his identities should be

728
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,560
an obstacle to you.

729
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,959
Potential resource is everything.

730
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,160
If less than 10 cards today,

731
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,199
you don't come back.

732
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,880
Is everyone clear on this?

733
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,120
Actually,

734
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:59,120
Sijing is my friend from college.

735
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,719
And you're coworkers.

736
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,360
I'll try to give you a better deal

737
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,560
if you apply for one today.

738
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:07,919
You're friends.

739
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:08,439
They're in.

740
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:08,919
Here.

741
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,439
Look at it.

742
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:09,999
He knows her.

743
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,239
Yeah.

744
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,040
You can count on me.

745
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:12,519
Here.

746
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:13,679
Look at it.

747
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,080
Thank you.

748
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,080
You didn't answer my calls

749
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,080
these days.

750
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,479
I thought you...

751
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:37,400
Well,

752
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:38,999
how's the flowers?

753
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,279
You sent them?

754
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,279
Why are you surprised?

755
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,640
You're back.

756
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,959
Just in time.

757
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:56,959
Are you tired?

758
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,959
What's that good smell?

759
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,919
Chef Ji.

760
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:03,479
You're great!

761
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,239
Of course.

762
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,600
Good?

763
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:13,279
Wonderful!

764
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
You're a good cook.

765
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,360
Here.

766
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,279
Arms up.

767
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,120
I heard from Zhao Fanggang that you

768
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,479
went to the hospital with Rao Jing.

769
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:32,959
How's everything going?

770
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,320
It went well.

771
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,199
After all,

772
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,160
I've been a lobby manager

773
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,679
for a few years.

774
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,519
It's just a credit card promotion.

775
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,919
It did start out a little rough.

776
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,199
But later

777
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,120
it's okay.

778
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,279
Delicious.

779
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,160
Make more.

780
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,360
Try this.

781
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,199
What's going on today?

782
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,479
You must want something from me.

783
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,320
We're at home.

784
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,519
Just say it.

785
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,479
Did you

786
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,199
get flowers today?

787
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:29,959
Never mind.

788
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,919
Help yourself.

789
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
Our school is pretty big.

790
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,959
It's easy to get lost on your first visit.

791
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,199
Why don't you

792
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,040
have your girlfriend

793
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,560
pick you up?

794
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,199
She's not my girlfriend.

795
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,239
So, she doesn't know how you feel yet.

796
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:10,439
You're here to confess?

797
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:13,759
It's her birthday.

798
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,320
The girls' dorm is right there.

799
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,439
Good luck.

800
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:31,279
Xiaoning.

801
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,840
Happy birthday.

802
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,600
I don't know...

803
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,959
what color roses you like,

804
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,880
so I've got these.

805
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,679
Check it.

806
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,840
Do you like any of them?

807
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,640
I like this.

808
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,759
I'll remember.

809
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,880
Xiaoning, I…

810
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,600
I love you!

811
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,400
I want to buy you

812
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,800
every blue rose in the world.

813
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:11,999
I hope you can

814
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:12,759
be my girlfriend.

815
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,600
Say yes! Say yes!

816
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Say yes! Say yes!

817
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,439
Give here a hug!

818
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,040
Kiss her!

819
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:52,679
Kiss her! Kiss her!

820
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:26,600
What's wrong with me today?

821
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,279
I should have made it clear

822
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,279
that I thought they're from him.

823
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,040
It wouldn't have been so awkward.

824
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,239
I need to tell him about

825
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,920
Lu Sijing as soon as possible.

826
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:39,799
I can't

827
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:41,160
let this happen again.

828
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,399
Xiaoning.

829
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,440
Why did you throw away

830
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,120
the flowers?

831
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,120
Did you have a quarrel?

832
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,440
No.

833
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,759
Did he mistreat you?

834
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:57,879
You tell me.

835
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:58,879
I'll kick his ass.

836
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,239
No, Fanggang.

837
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,120
What are you talking about?

838
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Just small talk between coworkers.

839
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,160
It's nothing to do with you.

840
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:09,440
Follow me.

841
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,319
You don't need my introduction.

842
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:31,719
The guarantor

843
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,839
of the bad loan you're

844
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:33,879
responsible for.

845
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:36,920
Mr. Shen.

846
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,399
Nice to meet you.

847
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,319
I haven't had the chance

848
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,799
to meet you.

849
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:45,799
You don't have to

850
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:46,759
beat around the bush.

851
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:47,640
Mr. Ji.

852
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,199
Just cut to the chase.

853
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,399
Okay.

854
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
Since your account manager

855
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,600
has arrived,

856
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,160
I'll get right to the point.

857
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,239
The foreclosure sale is imminent.

858
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,600
I'm calling on you

859
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,080
to do us a favor

860
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,960
to prevent the security

861
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,279
from being unsold.

862
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,319
What do you mean?

863
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:11,600
You don't have to do anything

864
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:12,839
but participate in

865
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:13,960
the auction.

866
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:17,480
Mr. Ji.

867
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,879
Mr. Zhao.

868
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:20,480
Are you here to help me

869
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,319
solve my problems

870
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,560
or to create some more?

871
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,120
Mr. Shen.

872
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,319
Don't get upset.

873
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,799
We're helping you avoid a lawsuit.

874
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:26,600
Think about it.

875
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,279
Usually, a lawsuit ends up

876
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,440
with the guarantor

877
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,600
paying all the money.

878
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,600
Just as Mr. Ji said,

879
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,080
you can lose less

880
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,040
if you

881
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,719
bid on.

882
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,600
Lawsuits are time-consuming

883
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,080
and laborious.

884
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:40,440
We're

885
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,080
on the same side now.

886
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,560
Mr. Shen.

887
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,040
You must be here

888
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,120
'cause

889
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,040
you trust us.

890
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:02,000
Please.

891
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,359
Let's work this out

892
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,480
together.

893
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:12,319
So, tell me exactly

894
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,000
what I need to do.

895
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,319
Mr. Shen.

896
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,520
Call me if you

897
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,520
have any questions.

898
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:24,960
I'm online 24/7.

899
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:26,839
I will.

900
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:28,920
Thank you.

901
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:29,960
Thank you.

902
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,000
See you soon.

903
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,160
Why do you help me?

904
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,399
It's not just for you,

905
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,440
but more for the department.

906
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,719
I'm counting on you

907
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,600
for his business.

908
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,719
Don't worry.

909
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,279
I'll take care of everything

910
00:37:58,279 --> 00:37:59,279
about Mr. Shen and Mr. Jiang.

911
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,399
Mr. Ji.

912
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:09,799
Thank you.

913
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,440
Go back to work.

914
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,279
When did I

915
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:21,239
become so shy?

916
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,120
Yikes!

917
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,199
Actually, Mr. Ji

918
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,679
isn't a bad person.

919
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,120
He's

920
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,359
just need an improvement

921
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,359
on the character.

922
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,719
After all, he's been abroad

923
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,440
alone for so long.

924
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,759
It's common

925
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:43,839
for him not to be good at

926
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:44,719
expressing his feelings.

927
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,199
This time,

928
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,560
he helped Fanggang out.

929
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,279
It's also a perfect

930
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,199
example that

931
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,560
he's a responsible man.

932
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,359
Oh my goodness.

933
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,199
There's a pride

934
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:57,520
in every word of yours.

935
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,799
Looks like

936
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:00,480
you're definitely

937
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,759
gonna marry him.

938
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,279
Can you survive a whole year

939
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,839
to become Mrs. Ji?

940
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,279
It's not

941
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:07,239
up to me.

942
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:09,000
We had a deal

943
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,199
and set our

944
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:10,920
own KPI

945
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,560
before we started

946
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,279
this relationship.

947
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,520
Whoever doesn't finish it

948
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,160
will leave.

949
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,199
I have to say,

950
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,279
you two are real

951
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:19,319
professionals.

952
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,560
What? KPI?

953
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,359
So how are you doing

954
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,160
on yours?

955
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,359
To turn to permanent,

956
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,199
I've made Lu Sijing

957
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,279
my client.

958
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,839
I work all day long

959
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,199
and prepare for

960
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,799
the test at night.

961
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,399
And you still have time

962
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,679
for a facial massage with me.

963
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,239
I knew

964
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,600
you love me so much.

965
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,199
Of course.

966
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,000
You've called me 3 times this week.

967
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:44,879
Spit it out.

968
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:45,839
What do you want?

969
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:46,759
I want to hide away.

970
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:48,799
What's going on?

971
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,399
I'm not hiding from anyone else,

972
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,040
but Qi Yu.

973
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:56,160
You don't know

974
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:57,600
how many stupid things he's done

975
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,719
to pursue me.

976
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,600
I'm all ears.

977
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,440
I posted a Moment

978
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,719
on Wednesday

979
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,759
saying that I didn't get a ticket

980
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:06,399
to the concert.

981
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,759
He took three different buses

982
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,560
to the outskirts for a

983
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,560
scalped ticket.

984
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,960
I knew it's fake on sight.

985
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,000
This is not the end.

986
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,040
You know,

987
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,239
I left a pair of old shoes on the doorstep,

988
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,319
ready to be discarded.

989
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:20,520
But he

990
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:21,920
fixed the break with glue

991
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,399
and brought them back to me.

992
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,600
Isn't it annoying?

993
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,080
I think it's sweet.

994
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,920
Qi Yu's love for you

995
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,759
is simple

996
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,600
yet profound.

997
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,960
Late love is the cheapest.

998
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,399
I don't give a damn.

999
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,600
Where are you?

1000
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,080
I just finished extra work.

1001
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,080
I'm gonna pick you up.

1002
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:41,520
It's too much work for you.

1003
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,560
No.

1004
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:43,319
I wanna

1005
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,239
go home with you together.

1006
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:45,239
Okay.

1007
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm at the spa.

1008
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,279
Right.

1009
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll see you later.

1010
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
How comfortable!

1011
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,000
Watching others

1012
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,560
fall in love is more interesting.

1013
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,120
You haven't seen for just hours.

1014
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,279
Isn't it too much?

1015
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:27,759
Look at you.

1016
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:29,199
I can almost see the lust

1017
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,799
in your eyes.

1018
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,600
Don't exaggerate.

1019
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:33,520
Cut it out.

1020
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:35,960
Are you tired?

1021
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,520
C'mon, we laid there

1022
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,600
for two hours.

1023
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,879
Mr. Ji.

1024
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,600
What are you doing here?

1025
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,719
Mr. Ji.

1026
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,600
Did you get the file

1027
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,480
I just gave you?

1028
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:02,399
I'm sorry.

1029
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,399
I won't take any papers

1030
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,600
home anymore.

1031
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,560
We've got work to do.

1032
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,399
We gotta go.

1033
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:09,120
Xiaoning,

1034
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,279
wait a minute.

1035
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:11,920
Sijing has something important to tell you.

1036
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,759
My work is really important.

1037
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:16,640
Let's talk about it some other time.

1038
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,120
Xiaoning!

1039
00:42:57,879 --> 00:42:59,719
Only a barbecue

1040
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,319
could cure

1041
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,560
my workday woes.

1042
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,879
How could you know

1043
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:45,359
I wanted a barbecue today?

1044
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,040
I know everything.
