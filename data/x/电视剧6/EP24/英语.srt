1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,120
You Are My Secret EP24

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,200
There was a large package

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,160
that fell from above.

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,479
Do you remember that?

6
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,399
I often watched you play

7
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,319
at the basketball court.

8
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,160
You remember that, right?

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
I honestly didn't notice.

10
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:04,920
How could that be?

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,360
Back then,

12
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,479
your roommate Chen

13
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,319
was dating my bestie Liu Liu.

14
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:10,720
I was always around

15
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,800
when you played.

16
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,360
And we often

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
had dinners together.

18
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,319
I do have a bit of an impression.

19
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,560
But

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,479
it seems we didn't

21
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,280
talk much back then.

22
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:20,879
Yuhui,

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,479
that was in the past.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,720
Now we are

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,479
colleagues.

26
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,280
I hope that in the future,

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,680
no matter the occasion,

28
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,440
don't be ambiguous.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,240
Don't mislead others

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,280
into misunderstanding our relationship.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,759
I know you're worried that others

32
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,879
might gossip about me behind my back.

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,479
It's fine.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,680
I don't mind that.

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,720
By the way,

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,359
there's a class reunion tonight.

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,240
I've already called the guys.

38
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,560
Will you go?

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,400
I've got other plans,

40
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,039
so I won't be going.

41
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,359
See you on Monday.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,240
Xiaoning.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,039
They're just so-so.

44
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,440
Back in my day,

45
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,520
I was the top small forward on campus.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
In terms of strength, speed, and skills,

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,319
I could easily outshine all the boys.

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,000
If you had seen

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
my glory back then,

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,039
you would have been charmed by me.

51
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,799
Who brags like that?

52
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,280
Mr. Ji, you're quite the narcissist.

53
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,079
Thank you.

54
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,599
You weren't the type to

55
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,799
just barely make it to class,

56
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,280
were you?

57
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,680
Of course not.

58
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,440
I practically lived in the classroom.

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,639
Really?

60
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,759
Of course not.

61
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,599
You're so annoying.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
Back in college,

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,599
I came to this library every day.

64
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,440
This path,

65
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,039
if you go that way,

66
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,359
leads back to the dorm.

67
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,079
On this floor,

68
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,199
I know exactly where it's worn out.

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,720
The bushes by the road,

70
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,879
I know which season

71
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,870
they bloom.

72
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,520
Back then, every day,

73
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
as I walked by, I thought,

74
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,280
if only I had someone

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,160
to accompany me.

76
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:32,559
I'll be with you.

77
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:35,799
I want to take you

78
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,720
to explore every path.

79
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
I hope that when I look back

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,799
on my college days,

81
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,080
I won't feel lonely.

82
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,559
At that time,

83
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,880
did you really just focus on studies

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,080
and not date at all?

85
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,280
Of course not.

86
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
That's 'cause you're holding onto

87
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,119
that dream girl in your heart.

88
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:54,799
She's quite something.

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,039
You don't believe me?

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,320
No.

91
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,200
Definitely not.

92
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,080
This is my dormitory.

93
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,119
It's a long time.

94
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:06,999
These balconies

95
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:07,679
are

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,520
unexpectedly sealed off.

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,799
What's up?

98
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,119
What's your history

99
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,640
with that?

100
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,559
You know,

101
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,479
our room

102
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,640
is the farthest from the library.

103
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,280
Every time the library closed,

104
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:18,760
the dorm also had to close.

105
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,840
So I had to

106
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,239
climb in through the balcony.

107
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:22,919
You really worked hard, huh?

108
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,039
That's like going through four more

109
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,239
senior years of high school.

110
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,200
That's ridiculous.

111
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,039
When we have kids in the future,

112
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:30,799
you'll understand

113
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,880
how important it is to have

114
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,760
a husband who loves to study.

115
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,799
Who's going to have kids with you?

116
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:36,960
Wait.

117
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:38,880
Who said I'd marry you?

118
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:40,999
Alright then.

119
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,080
So,

120
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,239
we won't have kids.

121
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,720
That way, no one will interrupt

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,559
our little world.

123
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,880
When we get older,

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,799
we can go

125
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,599
to a nursing home.

126
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,960
C'mon, kids one moment

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,080
and a nursing home the next.

128
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,280
Are you thinking

129
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,039
too far ahead?

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,280
That's because

131
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,439
in my plan for life,

132
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,479
you've always been a part of it.

133
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,280
Aren't you embarrassed?

134
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,359
You're so

135
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,119
full of yourself.

136
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,039
Ji Yuheng?

137
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,280
Sun Chen!

138
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,559
Yuheng!

139
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,599
How fancy!

140
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,280
What are you doing here?

141
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,679
Don't you remember?

142
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,160
After I finished graduate school,

143
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,359
I stayed on as an instructor.

144
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,760
I really forgot about that.

145
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,559
Who is this?

146
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,039
I'm his girlfriend,

147
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:25,799
Tu Xiaoning.

148
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:26,439
Nice meeting you.

149
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,239
Look at him.

150
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,960
I think

151
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
he's getting cuter lately.

152
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,760
Yeah.

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,999
Honestly, right now,

154
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:37,999
Ji Yuheng

155
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,799
is really a busy guy.

156
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,039
So hard to get a hold of him.

157
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,119
He didn't even show up for gatherings.

158
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,479
He really does

159
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,400
have work to handle,

160
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,200
so he asked me

161
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,359
to say hi to everyone

162
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,880
and apologize.

163
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,880
Yuhui is still looking out for him, huh?

164
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:50,760
Tell us the truth,

165
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,119
you two aren't just

166
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:52,999
colleagues, are you?

167
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
You're out of the loop.

168
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,559
They had something

169
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,119
special

170
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:57,960
back in college.

171
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,280
Really?

172
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,559
I don't think so.

173
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,919
Just that one time

174
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,119
in front of the first building,

175
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
he saved her,

176
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,999
remember?

177
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:09,880
Hey!

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,479
Hold on a second.

179
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,760
Actually, that's pretty straightforward.

180
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,999
Watch out!

181
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,080
Are you alright?

182
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:44,919
Here you go.

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,559
Thanks.

184
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,119
Did you

185
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,559
need me for something?

186
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,119
It's nothing.

187
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,799
Wrong person.

188
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,479
Let's go.

189
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:57,999
Go.

190
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,239
Are you alright?

191
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,119
So scary!

192
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,799
I'm fine.

193
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,799
What was that?

194
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Oh my!

195
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,160
A hero saving a damsel!

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,999
Such a classic move for flirting.

197
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,239
Isn't it a bit cliché?

198
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,919
Flirting?

199
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,999
Exactly!

200
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,280
So obvious.

201
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,359
Pretending to mistake someone,

202
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,439
but really,

203
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,799
he just wants you to remember him.

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,679
Is that guy

205
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,679
Sun Chen's roommate?

206
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,479
He's actually

207
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,359
pretty hot.

208
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,280
Be honest with me,

209
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
did he save you 'cause he likes you,

210
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,239
or did he fall for you

211
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,679
after saving you?

212
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Does it really matter?

213
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,039
Anyway, the first time he

214
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,400
looked at Yuhui,

215
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,919
his eyes were filled with love.

216
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,959
It was intense!

217
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,199
Aren't you guys

218
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
super close nowadays?

219
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,199
Ji Yuheng

220
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,000
has a better chance to win over you.

221
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,079
I've only been working for Dairui

222
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:57,559
for one year.

223
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,600
Right now,

224
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,679
we're still focused on work.

225
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,520
I see what you mean.

226
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,520
I got it.

227
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,319
Let's give President Ji

228
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,559
some time.

229
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,360
After all, he's a man.

230
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:07,600
He needs to be

231
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,360
put to the test.

232
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,559
In that case,

233
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,559
I'll be waiting for your wedding!

234
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,439
We haven't got that far yet.

235
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,360
I'm looking forward to yours.

236
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,000
We haven't got there either.

237
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,120
Sorry for being late.

238
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,319
- Hi, there. - You're late, man.

239
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,880
I ran into an old friend on the way

240
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,679
and chatted for a bit.

241
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:27,919
Guess who

242
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:28,520
I bumped into?

243
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:29,319
Who was it?

244
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:30,959
You'll never guess.

245
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:33,880
It was Yuheng,

246
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,439
Ji Yuheng!

247
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,839
My roommate!

248
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:37,400
Remember him?

249
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:38,959
I'm telling you,

250
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:40,120
he's showing

251
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,199
his girlfriend

252
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,559
around campus.

253
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,719
Really!

254
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,160
That guy...

255
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,000
He's really something, you know.

256
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,799
Are you just

257
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,120
making this up?

258
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,839
Yeah.

259
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,760
He couldn't possibly

260
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,079
have a girlfriend, right?

261
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,679
That's his girl for sure!

262
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,199
He introduced her to me himself.

263
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:57,520
And that girl

264
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,679
actually

265
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,520
admitted that.

266
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,880
You've got know,

267
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,640
the way he looks at his girlfriend

268
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,199
is incredibly gentle.

269
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
At first, I thought

270
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:10,959
Yuheng would be into those

271
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
gorgeous types.

272
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,240
I didn't expect someone to be so pure.

273
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:15,319
Well.

274
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,039
He told me

275
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,160
to keep it a secret from you all.

276
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,000
But then,

277
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
he got caught.

278
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,600
So you knew all along?

279
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
She knew it.

280
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,319
What a blunder!

281
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,600
I thought

282
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,839
I discovered some big secret.

283
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,799
Sun Chen,

284
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:35,079
you're late.

285
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,319
You owe three drinks!

286
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,039
Pour it up, pour it up!

287
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:38,959
Three drinks, OK?

288
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,679
Come on, come on!

289
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,520
Alright, alright!

290
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,360
Today, I'll

291
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
give it my best!

292
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,160
Just a little less.

293
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,199
Fill it up!

294
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,679
I have class tomorrow.

295
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:48,600
I'll

296
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,719
drink as a toast!

297
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,520
Sorry.

298
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,280
Watch your head.

299
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,280
Careful.

300
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,199
Come on.

301
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,319
Back in college,

302
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,600
my only way to unwind

303
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,839
was to come here and read.

304
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,039
Whenever I had a free moment,

305
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,719
I would quietly sit

306
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:12,600
in that corner by myself.

307
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I could easily spend the whole day there.

308
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,959
Wow, Yuheng!

309
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,959
I thought I was mistaken.

310
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,199
Sir, you still remember me?

311
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:24,079
How could I forget you?

312
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,600
You used to come here

313
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,480
when you were in college.

314
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:27,799
Such a handsome young man,

315
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,280
always sitting alone in the corner,

316
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,160
reading philosophy books.

317
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,559
You seemed low-key,

318
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,199
but you actually stood out a lot.

319
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,559
You've never brought anyone here before.

320
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:38,839
Your girlfriend?

321
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,160
Yes, she is.

322
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:44,760
Sir,

323
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,319
he really hasn't brought

324
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,199
any other girls here?

325
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,039
Yeah.

326
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,280
I even asked him

327
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,799
why he didn't bring his girlfriend.

328
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:51,839
He said he

329
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,079
has someone he likes.

330
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,760
I asked him

331
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,000
what she looks like.

332
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,199
He said...

333
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
I forgot the exact words,

334
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,039
but...

335
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,000
Just like you.

336
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:07,799
Like me?

337
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,799
The only impression I have is

338
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,199
that when she smiles,

339
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,120
her eyes curve into a line.

340
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:13,600
They're incredibly bright.

341
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,160
Just looking at her lifts his spirits.

342
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,559
Come on, don't make fun of me.

343
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,679
You're blushing!

344
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,760
Alright then.

345
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,199
You guys help yourself.

346
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:24,240
OK.

347
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,079
Thanks.

348
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,160
The girl he mentioned

349
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,880
is your dream girl, right?

350
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:34,559
Yes.

351
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,880
But honestly...

352
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,199
I don't want to know who she is.

353
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,600
Whatever,

354
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,319
the important thing is,

355
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:40,360
we're together now.

356
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,600
Even if she's here,

357
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,000
I won't let her have you.

358
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,039
You two should just give up on that idea.

359
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,160
You're quite lucky, huh?

360
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,799
You missed one dream girl,

361
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,400
but you found a similar one.

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,880
OK, back online.

363
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,439
Nothing serious.

364
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,839
Just a loose air switch

365
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,319
causing intermittent tripping.

366
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,839
I'm going to wash up.

367
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,719
The restroom is over here.

368
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,520
I've got grease all over my hands.

369
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,880
I need detergent.

370
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,760
It's that simple, huh?

371
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,799
What's wrong with

372
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,360
your kitchen drain?

373
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:39,439
Oh.

374
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,000
It doesn't need fixing.

375
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:41,959
I don't use the

376
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:42,799
kitchen much anyway.

377
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,480
Unlike that,

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,839
the electrical box needs repair for sure.

379
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,799
Since I'm here,

380
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,400
I might as well help you with it.

381
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,719
Really, it's not necessary.

382
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,000
The lease is ending,

383
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,679
and I won't be renting anymore.

384
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,799
You know, let's say

385
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,480
you don't care about the quality of life,

386
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:57,799
yet you carry designer bags

387
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,640
and wear designer shoes.

388
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,959
You get manicures every week.

389
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,079
So why is your life

390
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,360
so chaotic?

391
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,959
You don't do your laundries,

392
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,959
or take out your trash.

393
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,039
And your water pipe

394
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,280
is still dripping.

395
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:11,480
Anyway, since you've got nothing to do,

396
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,360
you should cook something at home.

397
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,160
Since you know how to cook,

398
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,760
give up those

399
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,520
pre-packaged meals.

400
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,199
They aren't good for your health.

401
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,319
If you're

402
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,600
really too lazy to cook,

403
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:25,880
just ask those young

404
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,480
booty calls

405
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,280
to do for you.

406
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,480
You know,

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
those are just kids.

408
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,959
They're still

409
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,360
their parents' little darlings.

410
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,480
How could they

411
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,679
cook for me?

412
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,679
Frankly,

413
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,000
those younger guys

414
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,679
are just

415
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,120
infatuated with mature women.

416
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,079
Besides, I live my life

417
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,199
with such style,

418
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,160
and I'm quite generous.

419
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,439
And I'm not

420
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,360
bad-looking either, right?

421
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,799
So everyone

422
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:52,839
is just playing along.

423
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,039
It's an unspoken agreement.

424
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,839
Why force someone

425
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,039
to settle down with me?

426
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,280
Alright,

427
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,959
this hose is broken.

428
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,520
I'll just tape it up for now.

429
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,199
Later,

430
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,240
I'll get you a new one.

431
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:23,839
Honestly,

432
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,400
you're quite

433
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,600
suitable for settling down.

434
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:27,760
So what?

435
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,760
After all these years,

436
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,919
I'm still on my own.

437
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm on my own as well.

438
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:34,959
Do you know

439
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:35,839
tough it was

440
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,160
when I first started living alone?

441
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:39,360
One time,

442
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
my appliances broke down.

443
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,919
I had to call the landlord for help.

444
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,799
Guess what?

445
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,439
He scammed me out of half a month's rent.

446
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,400
There was another time,

447
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,719
someone broke into my house.

448
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,839
At that moment,

449
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,079
I was terrified.

450
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,199
So I just lay in bed,

451
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,719
didn't dare to move.

452
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,719
I could hear him

453
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,199
rummaging through my things.

454
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,480
In the end, I have no idea

455
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,079
what he took.

456
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,079
Honestly, I didn't have

457
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,079
anything valuable at home.

458
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:00,679
Another time,

459
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,799
I went to the kitchen

460
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,760
to get something.

461
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,760
But the door was broken.

462
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,520
I couldn't get out.

463
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,319
My phone was left in the living room.

464
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,280
Guess what happened next?

465
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,199
I had to use

466
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,120
the kitchen knife

467
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,959
to break the lock

468
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:14,640
on the door.

469
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:15,839
That's how I finally got out.

470
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,199
You don't need to look.

471
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,439
It's not this place.

472
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,120
I didn't have much money back then,

473
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,880
and that place I rented

474
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,839
was almost on the outskirts.

475
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,600
That's not right.

476
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:28,839
With your personality,

477
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:29,600
you should just

478
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,559
argue with the landlord about rent,

479
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,839
corner the thief

480
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:33,719
and

481
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,360
call the police,

482
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,719
and

483
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,400
just

484
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,120
chop the

485
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
door

486
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,839
into pieces

487
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,919
completely.

488
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,400
I already told you,

489
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,199
that was when I first lived alone.

490
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,319
I just started back then.

491
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,120
Besides,

492
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,319
who is born strong and invulnerable?

493
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,919
Haven't I managed on my own

494
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,000
all these years?

495
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,120
So that's how I became who I'm today.

496
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,959
Why are you telling me all this?

497
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:12,240
Nothing, just...

498
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,120
You were just

499
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,079
nagging with me, right?

500
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,679
So I'll just

501
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:19,839
nag a bit back at you.

502
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,160
While you were

503
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,520
going on about that,

504
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,600
I was thinking,

505
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,400
over the years, I've spent so much time

506
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,519
either working

507
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,560
or just fooling around.

508
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,479
So I wonder if my life

509
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,919
could have another possibility.

510
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,439
What if I had

511
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,040
a trustworthy,

512
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,600
mutually supportive partner?

513
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,959
Coming home to a light,

514
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,400
with warm meals waiting for me.

515
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,880
Wouldn't that be nice?

516
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,519
Wait a minute.

517
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,719
What exactly are we doing?

518
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,279
I'm ready to get serious about dating.

519
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,919
But whether we'll have a future

520
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,959
depends on how you manage it.

521
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,080
I promise I won't disappoint you.

522
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,880
Weiyi!

523
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,679
What brings you here?

524
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,800
I came to welcome you back.

525
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,279
How does it feel

526
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,360
to officially start your job?

527
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:21,999
It's quite fun.

528
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,239
Did you notice that

529
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:24,959
duck neck shop on your way?

530
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,279
Where is it?

531
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,560
Just turn right on your way out.

532
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,120
It's an old brand that often has long lines.

533
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,360
Next to it,

534
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
a new nail salon just opened.

535
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:33,279
It's a new one.

536
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,640
It's very popular among girls.

537
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,239
The owners of these two stores

538
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:36,800
are always arguing

539
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,560
over trifles.

540
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,999
They argue every day.

541
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,080
It's quite a scene.

542
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,640
Today, it got so bad that we had to respond.

543
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,080
Really?

544
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,160
Hey, check this out.

545
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,320
That serious, huh?

546
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:44,959
Let me see.

547
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,080
A puppy?

548
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:48,840
Your

549
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,479
cases include catching dogs?

550
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,040
Of course!

551
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:52,840
The people

552
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,120
encounter all sorts of problems in life

553
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,959
and will come to us for help.

554
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,040
From

555
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,519
illegal renovations and neighbor disputes

556
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,160
to business owners being

557
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,279
threatened with acid attacks by shareholders.

558
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,160
These are valuable experience.

559
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,120
It's quite impressive, actually.

560
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,840
Your line of work

561
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,919
seems pretty exhausting.

562
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,160
Then you really need to stay fit

563
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,840
and improve your health.

564
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:12,959
How about

565
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,080
we do some sports this weekend?

566
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:15,840
Sounds good!

567
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:16,679
What sport?

568
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,400
I have a friend

569
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,360
who just opened a windsurfing club

570
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,800
right in the sea area.

571
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,239
It's really fun!

572
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,640
You should come with me.

573
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,959
For activities like this,

574
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,239
don't you have to pay in advance?

575
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,600
How much is it? Let me give you the money.

576
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,040
It's not much.

577
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,880
I've got it covered.

578
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,640
Did you forget again?

579
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,439
We agreed that I won't spend your money.

580
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:36,479
How much is it?

581
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,759
For this club,

582
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,600
you need to hire an instructor,

583
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,560
the one-on-one kind.

584
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:45,759
6,000 yuan.

585
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:47,679
I know.

586
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,080
You don't want to spend my dad's money.

587
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,719
You can take it

588
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,439
as if I lent it to you.

589
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,719
When you get paid,

590
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,679
you can invite me for something else,

591
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,439
OK?

592
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:57,400
Weiyi,

593
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,800
this isn't about borrowing and repaying,

594
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,719
but the economic gap between us.

595
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,679
It may affect our spending habits.

596
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,919
We're both pushing thirty.

597
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,040
We can't just keep playing around.

598
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,560
Shouldn't we think about the future?

599
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,239
I still want to

600
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,279
save up the money I have.

601
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,519
When the time comes for us to buy a house,

602
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,080
and pay the mortgage,

603
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,999
the pressure might be a bit less.

604
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Why do you keep bringing up

605
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,919
the future and houses?

606
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,679
Are we supposed to sacrifice

607
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,759
our current happiness

608
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,840
for the future?

609
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,360
I have money,

610
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,320
so why should I

611
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,919
be stingy?

612
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,999
That's no fun

613
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:26,759
at all!

614
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,479
I just want you

615
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,279
to join me for some windsurfing.

616
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,239
But you're

617
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,840
making it all about

618
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,800
economics and spending habits.

619
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:38,199
If you don't want to go, just say so.

620
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,959
I didn't mean it.

621
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,479
I don't have to do it with you.

622
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,360
I can go by myself.

623
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,479
Weiyi!

624
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,320
Weiyi!

625
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:50,840
Thanks.

626
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:52,959
Weiyi.

627
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,360
Coming tomorrow?

628
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,919
Sure, if I'm free.

629
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,800
I think it's

630
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,320
quite fun.

631
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,360
Yeah?

632
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:58,840
Wanna split

633
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,679
the gear with me?

634
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,959
It's a sweet deal,

635
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,279
like a starter pack with

636
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
a sail, 3 masts,

637
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,199
and halyard.

638
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:04,999
Like everything

639
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,160
a beginner needs.

640
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,759
If we buy together,

641
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,320
we get 20% off.

642
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,160
Only 4,800 yuan.

643
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,919
We're edging towards 30,

644
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,959
gotta think beyond

645
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,679
just having fun, huh?

646
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,199
I'm gonna stash

647
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,360
away what I can,

648
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,320
so when we wanna

649
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,080
buy a house,

650
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,999
we'll have less to worry.

651
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,199
I'm good.

652
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:24,959
I wanna make sure

653
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,120
I really like the sports before I buy.

654
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,759
Fine.

655
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,800
I'll ask around then.

656
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:29,679
Bye.

657
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,239
Bye.

658
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,880
It's been a whole day.

659
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,439
He hasn't even sent me a message.

660
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,679
He can't be serious about

661
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:47,279
splitting up

662
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,120
over money, can he?

663
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:50,880
It's crazy

664
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,040
how such

665
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,120
trifles are

666
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,320
eating into our relationship.

667
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,759
Alright, Qi Yu.

668
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,360
Since you don't come to me,

669
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,840
I'll come to you.

670
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,360
We said we'd grind

671
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,959
together and split the cash

672
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:17,759
from selling gear.

673
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,479
But now,

674
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,840
what's the deal?

675
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,519
Don't touch him.

676
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Come over here.

677
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,640
Clarify your demands,

678
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,199
got it?

679
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:24,640
I gotta lend it, right?

680
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Hey, you didn't even ask!

681
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:26,959
Calm down.

682
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:27,880
If you did, I wouldn't

683
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:28,479
have said no, would I?

684
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,360
That money's

685
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,519
partly mine too, isn't it?

686
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,519
You're really making

687
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:31,919
no sense right now.

688
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,439
What's going on?

689
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,560
What the hell?

690
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,400
You're ridiculous!

691
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,360
Why do I gotta

692
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,439
report to you for everything?

693
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,080
It's our money!

694
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,880
Just ask and I'd lend,

695
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,479
wouldn't I?

696
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:40,679
Kiddo, let's go have some fun.

697
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:41,279
Okay?

698
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,560
Do you even respect me?

699
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,279
Calm down.

700
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:44,719
Talk calmly.

701
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,919
This money ain't nothing!

702
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,999
You can't just

703
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,360
take it without asking me.

704
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,040
But I didn't have time!

705
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,679
Sir.

706
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,439
Will you

707
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,160
do something about my son

708
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,959
stealing my bankbook?

709
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:55,479
Yes.

710
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,080
We will.

711
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,400
Write down your request.

712
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,640
Okay.

713
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,400
Sir,  should I lend it?

714
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,040
Haven't eaten a thing?

715
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,800
Too busy to

716
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:23,560
eat today.

717
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,880
I had day shift today,

718
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,320
wanting to get you after,

719
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,919
but my buddy's

720
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,400
mom got a stroke,

721
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,320
and was hospitalized,

722
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,600
so I stayed for him.

723
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,040
Not mad at me, are you?

724
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,679
No.

725
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,120
I didn't realize your job

726
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,919
was so demanding.

727
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,919
You caught

728
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,439
the busiest time today.

729
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,959
It's not usually this busy.

730
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,479
Earning money is tough.

731
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,880
Of course.

732
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,759
It's quite tough.

733
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,160
But helping people

734
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,320
feels good.

735
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,640
Keeps me grounded,

736
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,679
knowing I'm doing

737
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,880
something real.

738
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,239
Good then.

739
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,719
Thanks to my job, paycheck

740
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:08,880
comes in.

741
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,600
But

742
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,560
I never thought about just

743
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,959
surviving on that small amount.

744
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,719
I spend

745
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,519
what I got,

746
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,959
and it's all good.

747
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,320
Sorry.

748
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,519
I was

749
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,199
always judging

750
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,840
you by my own rules,

751
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,279
didn't think about how you felt.

752
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,080
Weiyi.

753
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,080
Forget it.

754
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,759
I...

755
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,160
I tried sailboarding

756
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,080
and I found

757
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,040
that it

758
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,800
wasn't my jam.

759
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,600
The shoes

760
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,759
and the sailboard,

761
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,239
I kinda

762
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:51,160
forced them

763
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,360
on you.

764
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,679
I was wrong

765
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,880
about that.

766
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,439
Let's talk things through

767
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,640
from now on, cool?

768
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,600
Cool.

769
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,279
Qi Yu.

770
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:09,840
Just a minute,

771
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,560
I'll be right back.

772
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,040
Coming.

773
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:30,759
Since Prof. Jia's on board

774
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,239
as a financial expert,

775
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:33,279
Mr. Xia's

776
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,840
totally into it now.

777
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,439
We're meeting again

778
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,999
in five days to chat more.

779
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,439
Great.

780
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,519
You said

781
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,880
his attitude flipped.

782
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,880
Big bosses are all ears.

783
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,239
They promised that

784
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,600
all relevant depts

785
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,519
would cooperate with you

786
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,959
to make connections

787
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,880
and implement the best plan.

788
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
Quoting words from higher-ups,

789
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,080
"Grab the chance,"

790
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,999
"give it your all."

791
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,439
Clear?

792
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,239
Yes.

793
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,759
Don't worry, sir,

794
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,360
I'm gonna give it my all

795
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,600
to make this partnership work.

796
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
We said to take it easy,

797
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,199
but he's

798
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,400
pulling out all the stops!

799
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,239
He

800
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,519
even dragged

801
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,519
his mentor

802
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,320
into the mix?

803
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,560
What's his game?

804
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,479
Showing off

805
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,479
that fancy school he went to?

806
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,120
Huh?

807
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,439
Chill out, boss.

808
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,320
It's early days yet.

809
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,160
Who knows

810
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
what'll happen?

811
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,320
I've been kicking myself

812
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
for dropping

813
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,120
the Weiji project

814
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,400
too soon.

815
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,479
Yeah.

816
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
If we'd found

817
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,959
a way in, our S2

818
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,360
would be killing it

819
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,800
right now.

820
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,080
Hello? Zhang?

821
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,999
Juicy gossip?

822
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,320
I'm all ears.

823
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,679
Really?

824
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,600
I told you.

825
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,959
I'm not

826
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,120
a quitter.

827
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,800
When I say no,

828
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,719
it's a dead end,

829
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:30,080
no matter who's pulling strings.

830
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,360
Okay.

831
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,919
Thank you so much.

832
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,400
Dinner's on me next time.

833
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,360
Yeah.

834
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:40,560
Mr Xing.

835
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,080
Good news?

836
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,279
Spill the beans.

837
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,360
You nailed it.

838
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,479
Weiji's leader

839
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,600
of its overseas business unit

840
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,279
is dipping.

841
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,919
Xia Mingrui

842
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,199
has to fly out there

843
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,360
the day after tomorrow.

844
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,600
He's got

845
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,679
no gaps

846
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,999
in his calendar

847
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,040
for Ji Yuheng

848
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,160
at all.

849
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,479
Looks like

850
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,640
his

851
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,360
big meeting is gonna

852
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,080
be a no-show.

853
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,080
Xia Mingrui

854
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,519
spends over half the year

855
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,160
abroad.

856
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,320
Who knows

857
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,800
how long

858
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,679
he'll be away this time.

859
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,640
If

860
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,040
he's gone

861
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,959
for months,

862
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,759
that funding

863
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:24,880
could go up in smoke.

864
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:25,719
Yeah.

865
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,719
We know in sales,

866
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:28,759
delays

867
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,199
equal disaster.

868
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,439
Mr Ji barely managed to get him on board.

869
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,239
He's probably

870
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,400
freaking out.

871
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,439
Where to?

872
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,800
Walk.

873
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:49,759
I'll go with you.

874
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,360
Wait up.

875
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:53,199
Xiaoning.

876
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,439
What good will it do,

877
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,439
just walking in like that?

878
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,600
I saw you two on the street

879
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,080
a couple days ago.

880
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,519
And I know you followed

881
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,279
him to Jinghai.

882
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,959
You're crushing on him.

883
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,120
When he's

884
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,199
upset over his mom,

885
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,320
you're just taking advantage.

886
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,120
Don't be so naive,

887
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,800
thinking he'll

888
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,160
really like you back.

889
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,120
I'd ditch

890
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,640
Dairui Bank for him.

891
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,320
Would you?

892
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,519
Okay.

893
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,719
I'll call you back.

894
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,360
Knock before you come in.

895
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,160
Yuheng.

896
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,040
What's up?

897
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,439
I got a way in

898
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,239
with Weiji.

899
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,999
Yesterday I found out

900
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,719
my dad's

901
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,479
got ties.

902
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,999
I can hook you up.

903
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,919
The company my dad

904
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,880
has invested in

905
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,479
is helping Weiji's branch

906
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:03,279
with IPO.

907
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,999
Mr Xia will hang with them

908
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,279
before he jets off to the US.

909
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,160
What do you want in return?

910
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,479
You'll say yes

911
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,600
to anything?

912
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,840
I'll give it a good think

913
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,120
if it's in my hands.

914
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
If not, I'll take it

915
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,279
up the chain.

916
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,320
Not work-related.

917
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,160
Yuheng.

918
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
I know you were

919
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,160
really down after

920
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,679
your mom passed away,

921
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,560
and Tu Xiaoning

922
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:31,600
just happened

923
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,840
to be there for you.

924
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,560
I get it, totally.

925
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,080
But it's

926
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,120
been a while.

927
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
You gotta

928
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,800
let that go

929
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,560
and move on?

930
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,080
She can't help you.

931
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,080
And if words got

932
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,640
around the bank,

933
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,279
it could really

934
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,479
mess up your career.

935
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,120
Break it off with her.

936
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,640
All I want is this.

937
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,400
If okay,

938
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,439
I promise to have you meet Mr Xia.

939
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:00,959
And I'll help you with

940
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,080
any other

941
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,560
connections you need.

942
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:08,120
I'll take care of

943
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,959
Weiji myself.

944
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,919
Appreciate the offer.

945
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,640
Yuheng.

946
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,439
You're sharp.

947
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,560
This new

948
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,160
bank prez bid is huge.

949
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,719
Fail now,

950
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:27,999
might wait

951
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:28,999
years.

952
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:30,600
Don't regret it.

953
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,120
Tang Yuhui, seriously,

954
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:37,080
last time about

955
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,919
my personal stuff

956
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,080
at work.

957
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,519
You know better than

958
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,320
to blur those lines.

959
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:47,719
Get out.

960
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,560
Nobody thinks they'll

961
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,040
get away with

962
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,840
office hookups

963
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,160
without consequences,

964
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,360
right?

965
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,840
Who are you referring to?

966
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,560
She knows it.

967
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,199
Think about it.

968
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,759
Can you handle

969
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,840
the fallout if things go south?

970
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,519
She knows?

971
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,160
What's up with Yuhui?

972
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,679
Suddenly spouting

973
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:57,640
some crazy stuff.

974
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,400
No clue.

975
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,759
She's been like this for days,

976
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:01,840
got a short fuse or something.

977
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,160
You don't think

978
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:12,560
she found out about us, do you?

979
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,959
Did she rat us out to the boss?

980
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,919
If you're gonna freak out

981
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:21,320
like this, we might

982
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:22,400
as well break up now.

983
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:27,560
Break...

984
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,479
What?

985
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,479
Break what?

986
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,120
Mr Li.

987
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,400
After all this time

988
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,479
we've put into this project,

989
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,000
can't just break it now, huh?

990
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:40,279
Alright.

991
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:41,359
Let's grab

992
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,560
dinner after work.

993
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,120
Huh?

994
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,640
You're just as weird as her.

995
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,920
Chill out.

996
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,679
She hasn't blown the whistle yet.

997
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,440
And

998
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,080
she's got

999
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,399
a thing for your husband, right?

1000
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:57,600
If she ruins

1001
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,759
everything now,

1002
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,640
Ji Yuheng ain't gonna be pleased.

1003
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,879
She's not that stupid.

1004
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,480
But we can't risk it.

1005
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:05,799
Especially him.

1006
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Nobody knows

1007
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
him like I do.

1008
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,520
He's been through hell

1009
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,359
these past few months.

1010
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:13,279
Now things are

1011
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,359
finally picking up.

1012
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,239
I can't let

1013
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,040
this mess ruin it

1014
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,960
for him.

1015
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:18,520
If she pulls this card

1016
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,560
and says you

1017
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,399
gotta dump him,

1018
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,279
you gonna cave?

1019
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,160
Of course not.

1020
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:23,879
Cool.

1021
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,759
If you've

1022
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,640
got each other's backs to

1023
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,279
fight through it,

1024
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,839
nothing's gonna

1025
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,440
stop you.

1026
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,279
True.

1027
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:36,799
I'm really touched by the

1028
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:37,279
lovestruck you.

1029
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,480
You know what.

1030
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:44,520
If I knew

1031
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
you were dying

1032
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,359
to see

1033
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:46,960
Xia Mingrui,

1034
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:48,560
I would've ambushed him

1035
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,440
outside Jinlin Bar last night.

1036
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:50,839
You saw him last night?

1037
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,719
Last night,

1038
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,239
my dad got drunk there,

1039
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,120
so I went to pick him up.

1040
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,560
Right at the entrance,

1041
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
I saw Mr Xia getting into

1042
00:35:58,399 --> 00:36:00,199
the same car with Geng Nianyi.

1043
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,120
Something's fishy there.

1044
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:04,080
Geng Nianyi?

1045
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,440
That lady?

1046
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,440
Yeah.

1047
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,560
Isn't she married?

1048
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,319
I heard she married some

1049
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:19,879
secretive dude or whatever.

1050
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,160
Who says that secretive dude

1051
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
ain't Xia Mingrui?

1052
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,440
That place's a fancy joint,

1053
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,719
without a connection, you can't

1054
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,040
even make it to the parking lot.

1055
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:29,319
Just no one's

1056
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,279
snapped them together yet.

1057
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,399
You sure?

1058
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,719
Anyway.

1059
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,759
They were all over

1060
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,759
each other,

1061
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,679
something's up if

1062
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,080
they're not hitched.

1063
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:50,679
Weiyi.

1064
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Just got my paycheck,

1065
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:53,960
gonna hit the grocery

1066
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,480
store nearby.

1067
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,560
You coming?

1068
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,319
Go.

1069
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,080
He's got the night shift.

1070
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,359
Gotta see him now

1071
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:03,560
or it's tomorrow.

1072
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Alright, alright.

1073
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:05,920
Go then.

1074
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,799
Enjoy your time with him.

1075
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,839
Yeah.

1076
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,799
Got the sweetest love

1077
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:12,120
in the world.

1078
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:12,960
Eww.

1079
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:13,799
Go.

1080
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,719
Alright, I'm off.

1081
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:26,480
Two aroma diffusers.

1082
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:27,480
They'll

1083
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,199
gives the house a cozy vibe.

1084
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,080
And a kettle.

1085
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,960
Gotta stay hydrated.

1086
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,319
My hangers are happy colors

1087
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,839
like this,

1088
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,080
lifting my mood.

1089
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,879
The color is the key, huh?

1090
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:50,679
Quality's good, trust me.

1091
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:51,719
Don't worry.

1092
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,839
I won't splurge.

1093
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,600
Just some necessities.

1094
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:56,759
Okay.

1095
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,399
You need this.

1096
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,239
Hang your

1097
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,879
shirt with this.

1098
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,279
Your cop uniforms

1099
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,399
gotta be clean and crisp,

1100
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,080
no wrinkles or you'll

1101
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,879
lose that tough cop vibe.

1102
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,399
Got it.

1103
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,759
Let's go.

1104
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,560
Anything else?

1105
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,440
Right, laundry detergent.

1106
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:17,960
Mine at home smells great

1107
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,440
and lasts forever.

1108
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,399
Gonna ask nanny

1109
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,160
what kind it is.

1110
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,440
Got it.

1111
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:35,199
Let's go.

1112
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,560
1,385 yuan

1113
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,759
in total.

1114
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:42,679
How're you paying?

1115
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:43,759
Wait!

1116
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,839
Just these?

1117
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,920
Over 1,300 yuan?

1118
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,799
We don't

1119
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,679
need the diffuser

1120
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,719
or towels.

1121
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:51,120
Okay.

1122
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,000
Wait.

1123
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,040
Keep them if you like.

1124
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,480
I got this on my credit card.

1125
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,239
I've changed my mind.

1126
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,679
I don't use

1127
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,799
these often.

1128
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:00,920
Just return them.

1129
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:05,839
Alright, that's

1130
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,879
1,160 yuan now.

1131
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:07,920
Your code?

1132
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:09,920
So expensive.

1133
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,520
Here.

1134
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
It's done.

1135
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,040
First time checking the receipt.

1136
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:22,839
These laundry pods

1137
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:23,839
are pricey!

1138
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,679
No worries.

1139
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,080
They'll last me quite a while.

1140
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,080
What? The chopsticks

1141
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:30,080
are 40 yuan

1142
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,239
just for a few pairs?

1143
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,120
Might as well

1144
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,520
use disposables.

1145
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:34,839
Never mind.

1146
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Chopsticks are greener.

1147
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Money really flies fast.

1148
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,359
Didn't buy much,

1149
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,160
but ate up

1150
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,600
a third of your trial pay.

1151
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,879
Just

1152
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:45,960
some basics.

1153
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,199
I don't have many

1154
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:47,960
other expenses.

1155
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,399
No worries.

1156
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,399
I may still be

1157
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,600
able to save some money.

1158
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,719
My heart hurts.

1159
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,520
For what?

1160
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,199
I'm fine.

1161
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,399
For the money.

1162
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,719
So this is what it feels like.

1163
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,679
Ms Geng.

1164
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,879
Hope I'm not disturbing you...

1165
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,040
Nah.

1166
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,839
She sees tons of people,

1167
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
probably forgot

1168
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,759

1169
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,960
Ms Geng.

1170
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,520

1171
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,480
from Dairui Bank.

1172
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,640

1173
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,199

1174
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,040
but if you're free today,

1175
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,319
would it be possible to meet up?

1176
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,640

1177
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,080
Going out?

1178
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:14,920
Fanggang.

1179
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,960
Punch me out, will ya?

1180
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,679
Got a client meeting.

1181
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,480
Okay.

1182
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,560
Hi, Ms Geng.

1183
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,120
Please have a seat.

1184
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,239
Thanks.

1185
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:32,839
Excuse me.

1186
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:33,399
May I take your order?

1187
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:34,359
I'm good.

1188
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,279
Get her a banana milkshake, please.

1189
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,920
Okay.

1190
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:38,440
Thanks.

1191
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,279
That should be on me.

1192
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,640
You didn't take

1193
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
the money last time.

1194
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,480
Just came to say

1195
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:45,679
thanks again,

1196
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:46,640
sincerely.

1197
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,359
I hate

1198
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:49,799
owing people favors.

1199
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,600
So I'm here

1200
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,560
to say thank you

1201
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,359
again.

1202
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,319
Take it, please.

1203
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,520
Ms Geng.

1204
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,560
I can't take it.

1205
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,839
Then, what do you need?

1206
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:10,080
Wouldn't have

1207
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,279
contacted me otherwise.

1208
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,040
Wait for me out there.

1209
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,000
Okay.

1210
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,040
Now you can talk.

1211
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,080
Ms Geng.

1212
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,480
Please

1213
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,480
set up a meeting

1214
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,839
between Ji Yuheng from Dairui

1215
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,080
and Mr. Xia.

1216
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,520
Day 2 in Jinghai.

1217
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:58,359
Go check out Qingbei Uni

1218
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,160
and soak up some academic vibes.

1219
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:00,920
Yuheng.

1220
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,080
What are you up to?

1221
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,239
You got up early this morning,

1222
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,960
shampooed and primped

1223
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:06,960
yourself

1224
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,120
like a peacock.

1225
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,679
Got a crush

1226
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:11,480
on someone?

1227
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,120
Nah.

1228
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:13,839
You ready to give up the single life?

1229
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:26,920
Hey.

1230
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,520
Wait!

1231
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,080
Look out!

1232
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,199
Thanks.

1233
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,759
What did you

1234
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,080
wanna say?

1235
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,640
Nothing.

1236
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:07,399
Wrong person.

1237
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,199
Let's go.

1238
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:12,799
You okay?

1239
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,799
I was terrified.

1240
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,440
I'm okay.

1241
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,520
What the hell?

1242
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,600
Who did it!?

1243
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,199
Changes always beat plans.

1244
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:26,279
Jinghai.

1245
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:27,080
See you!

1246
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:29,480
What's up?

1247
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,160
Nothing.

1248
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:32,839
Let's go.
