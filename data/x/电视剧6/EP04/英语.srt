1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,120
You Are My Secret EP04

3
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,160
Xiaoning, have a seat.

4
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,280
Come on.

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,039
OK.

6
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,800
Mr Ji,

7
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,679
what's with the

8
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,360
scratch on your neck?

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,759
Do you have a girlfriend now?

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,039
It's from my cat.

11
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,119
They say

12
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,200
single men who raise cats are

13
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,599
pretty much like being in a relationship.

14
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,399
Dig in.

15
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,879
Which type of chopsticks should we get?

16
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,120
Which type are you used to?

17
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,520
I can use any of them.

18
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,039
Then let's go with the bamboo ones.

19
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,079
They are eco-friendly, lighter and

20
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,000
heat-resistant compared to metal ones.

21
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,039
They also don't contain high polymer

22
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,160
chemical agents, unlike the plastic ones.

23
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:32,639
Sounds good.

24
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:33,680
Good.

25
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,879
It seems that even an elite like him

26
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,639
has a domestic side.

27
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,440
Just park

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
over there.

29
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,560
I'll walk back by myself.

30
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,039
We were

31
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,840
in the same

32
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,560
office building before.

33
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,879
I think it's better to

34
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,000
keep a low profile.

35
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,000
After all, everyone knows us.

36
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,720
Why?

37
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,280
You know...

38
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,599
what happened

39
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,400
to us was sudden.

40
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,759
I haven't figured out

41
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,039
how to tell them.

42
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,160
Just give me some more time.

43
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:44,760
You're the boss.

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,119
By the way,

45
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,439
I checked the almanac.

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,359
The next three days

47
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,799
are good to get registered.

48
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,239
Shall we

49
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,679
go this afternoon?

50
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,039
OK, OK.

51
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,200
Ms Rao, good morning.

52
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,280
What's going on?

53
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,599
Did something happen?

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,880
The manager's position

55
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,960
is almost certainly decided.

56
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,359
I heard that the president

57
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,520
is meeting with the

58
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,080
next manager this morning.

59
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,280
What?

60
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,960
Isn't Ms Rao a candidate?

61
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,160
Why is she here?

62
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,599
Not her, nor Mr Zhao.

63
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,200
Then

64
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,520
who else in our department

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,919
has more experience than them?

66
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:47,840
Who is more suitable?

67
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,359
I heard

68
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,799
it's a direct appointment.

69
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,799
They are discussing it inside.

70
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:53,880
Who is it?

71
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,200
Would it be Mr Xing from section two?

72
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,200
God, no!

73
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,720
We would be fine working

74
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,400
under Mr Jiang.

75
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,760
We could get a brief respite.

76
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,239
But if working for Mr Xing,

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,119
there would be

78
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,960
no hope for us at all.

79
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,359
Exactly.

80
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,919
My fellow colleagues,

81
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,840
you are all here, huh?

82
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,439
Come on,

83
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,760
have some fruit.

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,520
I got up

85
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,919
early today and

86
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,200
freshly picked these from the orchard.

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,960
Have some, here,

88
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,320
come on.

89
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:18,880
Take one, here.

90
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:19,359
Thank you.

91
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:20,960
Mr Zhao,

92
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,200
come one,

93
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,999
have some.

94
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,039
Thank you.

95
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,960
Ms Rao, hey.

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,960
Come on!

97
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,919
Join us.

98
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,280
Have some.

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,479
Well, you're so kind,

100
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,599
coming in so early

101
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,880
to warm our hearts

102
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:32,840
with these.

103
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:33,359
Thank you.

104
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,400
But I don't think Mr Xing

105
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
simply being here

106
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,679
just to deliver fruit.

107
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,760
He should have

108
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,239
come to see who was called in

109
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:41,919
for the conversation.

110
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
But as you wish,

111
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,359
everyone is present.

112
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:45,439
Mr Rao,

113
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,160
sometimes you tend to overthink.

114
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,359
This conversation

115
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,640
is about section one,

116
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,960
what does it

117
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,039
have to do with section two?

118
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,359
Besides,

119
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,640
Mr Xing wouldn't be

120
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:56,599
so petty as to

121
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,599
meddle in other businesses.

122
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,119
Reaching too far

123
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,559
can easily lead to trouble.

124
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:02,960
Honestly,

125
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,160
no wonder your performance

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,840
is lacking.

127
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,799
Both veterans are not proactive,

128
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,200
and are giving up the position willingly.

129
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,239
And yet they expect

130
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,039
the people under them

131
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,640
to deliver results.

132
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,479
Listen to me,

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,840
you should just

134
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,400
merge with us.

135
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:23,679
Mr Xing,

136
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,080
don't forget to take the trash with you.

137
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:26,999
Sure, sure.

138
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,479
Hey, you're here.

139
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,080
Sir.

140
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:29,840
Oh, Mr president.

141
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,320
I know you're very driven,

142
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,119
but you should also leave

143
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,919
some opportunities for

144
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,720
the other key members.

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,559
But...

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,679
who else in section one is fit to lead?

147
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,239
Anyone more qualified than me?

148
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,760
Then what do you think

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,880
of the younger generation?

150
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,840
Fanggang,

151
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,119
do you want me to smash it?

152
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:27,999
Sure.

153
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,239
Never mind.

154
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,080
Hey,

155
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,599
I just can't wrap my head around it.

156
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,119
There's no talent within our bank, huh?

157
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,239
Why do we have to settle for

158
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,160
such an inexperienced kid

159
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,720
as the manager?

160
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,320
He's from the Compliance Dept.

161
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,559
What else can they do

162
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,239
besides auditing?

163
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,200
Fanggang,

164
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,320
are you OK with it?

165
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,039
I honestly feel upset for you.

166
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,640
After being diligent for years,

167
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,479
shouldn't it finally be

168
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,400
your turn?

169
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:49,439
Exactly.

170
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,080
Do your best and leave the rest to fate.

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,039
Many things

172
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,999
don't always go as planned.

173
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,919
Besides,

174
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,000
didn't you notice

175
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,480
the president was backing him up?

176
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,520
Fanggang,

177
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:00,640
why are you

178
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,760
defending him?

179
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:02,360
Yeah.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,520
Look at everyone here.

181
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,480
Which one of us

182
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,799
has not been struggling

183
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,000
among various clients?

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,760
He wants to lead us, right?

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,439
Fine.

186
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,640
Let's see how he

187
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,919
holds his position.

188
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,319
He hasn't even

189
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,439
officially started yet.

190
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,199
However,

191
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,240
I do think he's quite hot.

192
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,160
That's true.

193
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,280
He can be considered

194
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,719
a nice perk for our girls.

195
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,280
Right,

196
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,799
Xiaoning?

197
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,079
You all,

198
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,799
don't just be sour grapes.

199
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,439
If you're really capable,

200
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,079
he wouldn't have gotten the position.

201
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,199
What do you mean?

202
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,919
I mean you're not good enough.

203
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,559
Starting today,

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
just focus on your jobs.

205
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,600
Got it!

206
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,240
Back to work.

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,079
Let's meet up.

208
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
There's something I'd like to know.

209
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,199
Hello, Mr Yao.

210
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,000
Yuheng.

211
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,799
Regarding the audit for

212
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,959
all branches in Nanhu Province

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,520
in August,

214
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,760
we're about to have

215
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,559
a debrief today.

216
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,120
We are all waiting for you in here.

217
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,880
Alright.

218
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,959
I'm on my way.

219
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,880
Good.

220
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,600
Sorry,

221
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,799
I'm kind of busy today.

222
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:28,760
Can we meet

223
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,799
after work?

224
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:30,600
Busy?

225
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,240
Busy with becoming the

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,000
manager of section two?

227
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,480
Have you heard?

228
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,600
Ji Yuheng from the Compliance Dept

229
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,760
got transferred to the BDD.

230
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,600
Really?

231
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,880
Isn't it still undecided?

232
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,400
But,

233
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,799
I'm so jealous of them.

234
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,679
Having such a hot stuff as their manager,

235
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:49,679
that's definitely

236
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,360
a motivation for work!

237
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,439
That's for sure.

238
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,199
I heard

239
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,280
he's still single.

240
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,120
Really?

241
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,400
Let's go, go.

242
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:57,360
You're done, right?

243
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:57,919
Let's go.

244
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,719
Everyone has the right

245
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,480
to pursue love.

246
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,520
But if you wanna trade your career

247
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,360
for love,

248
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,160
and have an office romance,

249
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:07,439
I think it's best to

250
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,360
ditch that love-struck mindset

251
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
as soon as possible.

252
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:10,959
Lay off those dramas

253
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,439
with a domineering CEO falling for

254
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,799
a Mary Sue type.

255
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,319
For women,

256
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:16,439
the most important thing

257
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,719
is to have a strong grip

258
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,360
on your career.

259
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,160
But what if

260
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:22,360
the guy also has the same mindset,

261
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,439
and he's willing to quit the job for love?

262
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,679
Go ahead and ask about what happened

263
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,959
to Liu Xiaoli from section two.

264
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,240
You'll find out just

265
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,799
how unlikely that really is.

266
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,360
Then why was Liu Xiaoli the only one

267
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,120
who got transferred?

268
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,799
One is a rookie just starting out,

269
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,679
the other is

270
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,959
Mr Xing's right-hand person,

271
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,559
a key player in section two.

272
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,919
Isn't that obvious

273
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,959
who stays and who leaves?

274
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,679
Liu Xiaoli's lover was also

275
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,360
subjected to disciplinary actions,

276
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,039
but only symbolically.

277
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,640
Let's go home together after work.

278
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,839
What would you like to eat?

279
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,760
I'll cook for you.

280
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,199
By the way,

281
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:03,839
what did you want to ask me earlier?

282
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,719
Let's talk about it

283
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,679
on the way back.

284
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,520
Don't bother.

285
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
I'm gonna my parents' place for dinner.

286
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:16,039
The round eggplant is firmer.

287
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:19,079
The long ones are mushier.

288
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
And this is a string eggplant,

289
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,039
which is also moist.

290
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,880
It's a variegated eggplant.

291
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,839
Stop messing around.

292
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,880
Yuheng is a good cook, right?

293
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,559
His place is not far from ours.

294
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,600
Feel free to come back for dinner.

295
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,559
She doesn't need to learn cooking.

296
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,919
What's the relationship

297
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,799
between these?

298
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,199
I'm talking about our daughter.

299
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:39,480
She doesn't have to cook,

300
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,520
but she should definitely know how.

301
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,079
She's married,

302
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
and supposed to be different.

303
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,760
A married woman

304
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,400
must be independent.

305
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,959
She should have her own career

306
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,079
and also manage her life well.

307
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:49,439
Am I right?

308
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
She needs the kind of confidence and

309
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,039
courage that allows her to survive

310
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,319
regardless of whom she lives without,

311
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,600
well,

312
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,679
including her

313
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,439
parents and husband,

314
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:58,439
ensuring that

315
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,880
she won't starve even

316
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,559
when she's on her own.

317
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:02,319
Dad.

318
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,520
How do you know Ji Yuheng

319
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,439
is a good cook?

320
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,919
Don't boys these days

321
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,959
all know how to cook?

322
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:11,559
So it was your guess, huh?

323
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,039
He should know, right?

324
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:21,919
Here we go!

325
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,880
It smells wonderful!

326
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Right, amazing!

327
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,079
Welcome back.

328
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,199
Dad, mom.

329
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,559
Yuheng is here.

330
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,079
I've got an eggplant salad coming up.

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,679
Dinner will be ready soon.

332
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,280
Xiaoning loves

333
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,199
eggplant salad.

334
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,520
What are you doing here?

335
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,799
How did you get in?

336
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,760
I had a feeling something was off.

337
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:51,839
See.

338
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,719
They didn't come home together.

339
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,760
Yuheng even

340
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,120
called us saying he's coming.

341
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,679
Nah, everything is fine.

342
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,240
Isn't it normal

343
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,160
for couples to argue?

344
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,719
What's normal about it?

345
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,799
For your information,

346
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,919
our daughter

347
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,919
isn't someone picky.

348
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,400
I need to ask her about this later.

349
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:10,839
It's just your imagination.

350
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,839
Stay out of the kids' matters.

351
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,520
They can make it.

352
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,039
You're just dodging the real issue,

353
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,679
you know.

354
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,959
In a marriage...

355
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,719
Move over!

356
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,839
It's all about the little things.

357
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,280
If they're not handled properly,

358
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,039
the consequences

359
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:25,839
are unimaginable.

360
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,919
Didn't you say

361
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,199
you're going home for dinner?

362
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:31,160
So I came here as well.

363
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,360
I mean...

364
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,079
my parents' home.

365
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,520
Aren't your parents

366
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,520
mine as well?

367
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,520
What happened today?

368
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,120
You wanna ask me something earlier.

369
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,799
What's that?

370
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:44,919
Not a good time now.

371
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:46,799
Let's discuss it later.

372
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,799
Sorry for the wait.

373
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Thanks, Yuheng.

374
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,640
Here

375
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,280
comes eggplant salad.

376
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,280
This is quite a spread!

377
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,120
Alright,

378
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,919
let's dig in!

379
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,520
Come on,

380
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:01,959
Yuheng,

381
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,039
you've done all the hard work.

382
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,039
Here you go.

383
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,039
Let me serve you first.

384
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,559
OK.

385
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,240
Thanks, dad.

386
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,799
Would you like some fish?

387
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,280
I don't eat fish.

388
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,799
Too many bones!

389
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,600
I prefer meat.

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,679
This fish

391
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
is fresh and good for the brain.

392
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,439
You just love meat.

393
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,640
Picking bones is too much hassle.

394
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,360
I don't like it.

395
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,559
Isn't it true that

396
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,600
nothing is too troublesome?

397
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Compared to other major life events,

398
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,719
eating is one of the simplest things.

399
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,559
If there are bones, just pick them out.

400
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,839
If there's a problem, just solve it.

401
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:32,719
Right, Yuheng?

402
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,240
If you're not even

403
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,039
willing to tackle this,

404
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,360
how are you gonna manage

405
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,919
all the long days ahead?

406
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:00,760
You

407
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,679
seem to have some issues with me.

408
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,959
Exactly what's going on?

409
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Let's talk after dinner.

410
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,799
Alright.

411
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,240
You two should stop

412
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,919
playing these tricks

413
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,160
right under our noses.

414
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,880
What's really happened?

415
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,199
Nothing.

416
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,520
Nothing happened,

417
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:24,679
right?

418
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,880
Mom, you love fish soup.

419
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,160
Let me get you some.

420
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,520
Dad, mom,

421
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,240
actually, today,

422
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
I've received a

423
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,319
job offer.

424
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,559
I'm about...

425
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,559
Get burnt?

426
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,919
Impossible.

427
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,160
It's been served for a while.

428
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,039
She couldn't possibly get burnt by it.

429
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:49,959
Yuheng,

430
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:50,679
keep going.

431
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,120
- Actually, it's a transfer... - Dad.

432
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:57,799
Um...

433
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,559
Mr Liu

434
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,199
just mentioned he needs to talk to you.

435
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,839
It just came to my mind.

436
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,520
Usually he doesn't reach out to me.

437
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,240
If he's looking for me,

438
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,760
it must be...

439
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,520
something important.

440
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,640
I've got to see him.

441
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,319
Dad.

442
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,520
Are you going alone?

443
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,559
You should come with me.

444
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,600
Why should I?

445
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
I was talking with Yuheng.

446
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,439
You could talk later.

447
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,039
His family just got a dog.

448
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,880
It's ferocious!

449
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,039
When did they get a dog?

450
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:23,719
Come on, follow me.

451
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:24,959
- I was about to... - They just got it.

452
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,079
It's a huge dog.

453
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,400
Aren't you gonna see your friend?

454
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,439
Forget it.

455
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,040
Every time we meet,

456
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,080
he brags about his grandson.

457
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,759
It drives me crazy.

458
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,320
Look at you.

459
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,160
Do you even look like a father?

460
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,320
Besides,

461
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,959
you're a grown man.

462
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,880
Come on, stop it.

463
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,239
I should

464
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,759
do all the spying.

465
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:55,360
Move aside.

466
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:56,840
Hey.

467
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,479
Just cut to the chase.

468
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:03,959
Did you just

469
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,360
plan to tell them

470
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,040
that you're

471
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,640
assigned to the BDD

472
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
as my supervisor?

473
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:11,719
So, you knew it.

474
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,679
It's all over the Xingcheng branch.

475
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,719
How could I not know?

476
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,199
My mom used to be an accountant,

477
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,600
so she's quite

478
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,160
sensitive to these rules.

479
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,560
If you bring this up,

480
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,800
don't you think they would be worried?

481
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,279
But it doesn't

482
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:24,919
really matter.

483
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,759
After all, this marriage of ours

484
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,759
will come to an end finally.

485
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:29,519
They'll find out then.

486
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,320
What do you mean

487
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,519
by saying that?

488
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,679
Are you saying...

489
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,439
Break up, of course.

490
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:39,479
While our relationship

491
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,320
is still at a surface level,

492
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,519
let's part on good terms.

493
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,759
Why?

494
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,759
What?

495
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,800
You don't really need

496
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
me to explain

497
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,600
Dairui's rules

498
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,239
about office romances, right?

499
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,600
You just got appointed

500
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
as the head of our section.

501
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,840
What if our relationship

502
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,600
gets exposed?

503
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,840
One of us will have to go.

504
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,679
Who do you think

505
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,160
will be the one to leave?

506
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,640
You are

507
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,279
personally appointed by the president.

508
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,120
As for me,

509
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,360
I'm just some temp worker

510
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
who could be laid off anytime

511
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,199
without any solid reasons.

512
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,080
It's pretty clear, right?

513
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,080
It will definitely

514
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,919
be me.

515
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
Rather than living each day

516
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
in constant anxiety,

517
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,120
not knowing when

518
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
our secret will be exposed,

519
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,800
I think it's better if

520
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,679
I end this relationship myself.

521
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,479
So this is what you're worried about.

522
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,479
Even if you didn't ask me today,

523
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,239
I would bring it

524
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:44,719
up.

525
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,080
And this is an offer

526
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,239
from the president.

527
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,320
I haven't made a final

528
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,239
decision yet.

529
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:51,719
The whole thing

530
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,040
is still up in the air.

531
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:56,840
Tu Xiaoning,

532
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,279
you want to break up with me

533
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,320
because of something

534
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:01,719
still undecided?

535
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,640
Is this truly how you

536
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,959
perceive our relationship?

537
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,239
Don't you think this is rather hasty?

538
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,040
I...

539
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,759
What's going on?

540
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,479
A bone?

541
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:18,320
Stay still.

542
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,880
The key, the key!

543
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,320
Come on! Hurry!

544
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,679
Why?

545
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,320
Hurry up!

546
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,279
Does it hurt?

547
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:26,640
What's wrong?

548
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,800
A fish bone got stuck in her throat.

549
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:28,919
Some vinegar should help.

550
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:29,400
There's still

551
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,880
half a steamed bun left from breakfast.

552
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,239
It could damage her esophagus.

553
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
I'll take her to the hospital.

554
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,999
Don't worry, let's go.

555
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,759
Alright, alright.

556
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Hurry up and go!

557
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,120
OK.

558
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:43,080
It hurts!

559
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,439
Miss,

560
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,800
I'd like to know this is...

561
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,320
It's a laryngoscopy.

562
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,199
By using this, we could

563
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,199
see what's going on in her esophagus.

564
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,239
Will it hurt with

565
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:57,560
such a long tube?

566
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,199
We'll apply anesthetic.

567
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,800
The one next door has an injury.

568
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,600
It's a different case.

569
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,919
I've never seen a family member

570
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,199
more nervous than the patient.

571
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,040
Don't worry,

572
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,840
it's nothing serious.

573
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,600
We rely on you.

574
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:16,919
Tu Xiaoning, right?

575
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:17,999
Come here.

576
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:27,880
Alright.

577
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,840
The bone has been removed.

578
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,239
Thank you.

579
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:36,840
The doctor said

580
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,239
the puncture wasn't deep.

581
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,320
It'll be alright in a couple of days.

582
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:42,560
Alright.

583
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:43,320
Stop crying.

584
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,199
I'm not crying.

585
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,120
It's just a physiological reaction.

586
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
It's from the throat being irritated.

587
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,080
Yeah, it's indeed physiological.

588
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,999
You'll be fine soon.

589
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,600
Your husband really cares about you.

590
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:00,919
Let's go.

591
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,160
Thanks.

592
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,919
Here, have some water.

593
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,360
Thank you.

594
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,279
You're my wife.

595
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,800
No need for thanks.

596
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:27,479
- You... - You...

597
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,080
You go first.

598
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,999
About the transfer to section one,

599
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,160
I think I owe you

600
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,919
an explanation.

601
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,040
The president

602
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,160
wants me to lead it

603
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,080
for a reason.

604
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Mr Xing from section two

605
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,040
just landed a huge project days ago.

606
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,199
He's on a roll.

607
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,840
The headquarters wanna

608
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,759
merge the two sections

609
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,519
and have him manage it.

610
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,719
The leadership for section one

611
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,840
is now absent.

612
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,679
Jing and Fanggang are competing.

613
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:02,439
Also,

614
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,560
many people are quitting.

615
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,919
It can be described as a

616
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,080
tricky mess.

617
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,640
At this moment,

618
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,479
I have no better choice

619
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,519
than you.

620
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,439
Just one year.

621
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,600
We're

622
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,679
only given one year

623
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:15,439
to reorganize section one.

624
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:16,999
Once the time is up,

625
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,719
I won't force you to remain in there.

626
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,759
As for the Compliance Dept,

627
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:21,800
don't sweat it,

628
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,360
I'll let them know about it.

629
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,999
I won't make you look bad.

630
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,040
Sir,

631
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:29,360
I've still

632
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,519
got a question for you.

633
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,199
Go ahead.

634
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,160
Why are you so insistent

635
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,719
on keeping section one?

636
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,360
It has many small and micro enterprises

637
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,199
among the clients.

638
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,279
Once it get merged with section two,

639
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,160
this business will be greatly reduced.

640
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,600
But it's precisely these enterprises

641
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,320
that could address many

642
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,160
employment issues.

643
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,400
So,

644
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,320
I just want to do my best

645
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,360
to keep it.

646
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,040
Got it.

647
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:57,439
I'll think it through

648
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,560
after I get home,

649
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,080
and get back to you ASAP.

650
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,519
So,

651
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,519
keeping section one

652
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,800
is no simple task.

653
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,040
The terms set by the headquarters

654
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,959
require a 50% increase in performance.

655
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,439
This will be an impossible task.

656
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,040
Isn't that putting you in a tough spot?

657
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,800
But,

658
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:22,239
you are willing to take it, right?

659
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:25,080
After all, you didn't say no.

660
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,479
Right?

661
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,279
Actually, I hesitated

662
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,040
for two reasons.

663
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,679
The first one is

664
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:35,880
the president has indeed helped me.

665
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,080
After graduating from college,

666
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,479
I wanted to study abroad.

667
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,080
But publication in core journals

668
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
is a prerequisite

669
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,040
for scholarship eligibility.

670
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,160
After mine was published,

671
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,080
without my knowledge,

672
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,439
my first author status

673
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,400
was taken by an associate professor.

674
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,400
The president,

675
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,199
risking offending colleagues,

676
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,479
fought for me in the matter.

677
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,759
He even personally wrote a letter

678
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,800
to the journal.

679
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,239
That's how I regained my authorship.

680
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,239
He also

681
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,519
helped me

682
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,880
secure the scholarship.

683
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,519
So,

684
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,719
you're doing this to repay a favor.

685
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,199
What's your second reason?

686
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,400
Because of

687
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,479
my mother's condition.

688
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:26,759
I need money.

689
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,120
What happened to her?

690
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,719
She has two new

691
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:33,679
distant metastases.

692
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,840
The last medication was used for too long,

693
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,400
and the tumor has developed resistance.

694
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,199
Now we can only use

695
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,479
the latest foreign products.

696
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,320
Those targeted therapies

697
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,519
are not covered by insurance.

698
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,040
The cost will be significant.

699
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,239
So, for me, leading section one

700
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,239
would be a high-risk,

701
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,279
but high-reward opportunity.

702
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I'd like to take a chance.

703
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,640
These two reasons

704
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,320
sound solid.

705
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,279
If I were you,

706
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,439
I would also take this chance.

707
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,759
Xiaoning,

708
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,800
I did intend to

709
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:13,239
discuss this with you.

710
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,120
I won't force you to accept it either.

711
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
You're my wife.

712
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,959
And I understand

713
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,199
all your concerns.

714
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,439
If I really take this offer,

715
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:25,999
it will definitely cause you

716
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:26,840
some trouble.

717
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:29,679
But I truly was not

718
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,679
disregarding your work.

719
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,479
It wasn't a placement on your team

720
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,999
without prior notice either.

721
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,479
I don't want you

722
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,519
to leave alone

723
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,519
after something goes wrong.

724
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,679
The Compliance Dept

725
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,959
was my first choice.

726
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,160
I genuinely enjoy my current job,

727
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:45,400
so I don't feel the urge to transfer.

728
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
You can be assured of that.

729
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,479
There's been a lot happening recently.

730
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:53,840
This has made it difficult

731
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,160
for me to clarify the situation.

732
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,199
We all need

733
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,880
more time.

734
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,400
Alright.

735
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,519
But please don't take too long, OK?

736
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:56,800
Sir,

737
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,279
are you asleep?

738
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,880
Hello, sir.

739
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,120
Yuheng,

740
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,560
have you made up your mind?

741
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:11,719
Yes, I have.

742
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,479
I'm sorry to let you down.

743
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,959
I wanna

744
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,479
stay in the

745
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,279
Compliance Dept.

746
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,199
If there's anything else in the future

747
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,479
that I could assist you with,

748
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,519
I will certainly give my best.

749
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,679
Thanks, sir.

750
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,919
I will find a way to cover

751
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,560
my mom's medical expenses.

752
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,479
Given his situation,

753
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,919
transferring to section one

754
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,160
would certainly be the wise choice.

755
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
He shouldn't have given up

756
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,999
the change for my sake.

757
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,719
Last night, I didn't fully grasp

758
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:27,999
the reasons behind your transfer,

759
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,959
and I ended up losing my temper.

760
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,600
That was my fault,

761
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm 27 years old.

762
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,840
I no longer have the

763
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,759
enthusiasm of my twenties

764
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
or the luxury of making mistakes.

765
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,199
This is my first job

766
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,320
after graduation.

767
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,759
I haven't been made permanent in 3 years,

768
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,880
and finding a new job will be tougher.

769
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,600
To be honest,

770
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,840
I've been...

771
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,279
under a lot of pressure.

772
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:52,279
I don't want anything

773
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,679
to interfere with my work.

774
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,800
I understand your concerns.

775
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,560
Actually, last night,

776
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,040
I clarified everything with the president.

777
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,040
But I don't want you to give up

778
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,160
this opportunity to lead section one

779
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
because of me.

780
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,719
I would feel stressed.

781
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,560
I thought about it all night last night.

782
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:12,120
How about

783
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,919
we make an agreement?

784
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,160
Agreement?

785
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,120
Yes.

786
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,719
Let's set a one-year term.

787
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,679
We'll let our skills do the talking.

788
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,120
Since if we get exposed,

789
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,199
one of us must resign.

790
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:25,120
Then,

791
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,400
we can each set

792
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,959
a KPI for ourselves.

793
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:27,719
Whoever meets

794
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,400
the KPI

795
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,999
will remain.

796
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,160
The one who fails will leave.

797
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,360
How about that?

798
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:33,800
Sounds like

799
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:34,919
an earnout agreement.

800
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:35,919
Exactly.

801
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:37,759
Are you serious about this?

802
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,880
I am.

803
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,600
I want to challenge myself.

804
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,160
Besides,

805
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,880
I don't think I'm going to lose.

806
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,800
But

807
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,080
regarding the marriage registration...

808
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,239
Our relationship

809
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,759
should progress

810
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:52,759
with marriage in mind.

811
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,759
Sure.

812
00:30:59,199 --> 00:30:59,919
One year it is.

813
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,239
If within a year,

814
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,080
you find me

815
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,160
satisfactory,

816
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,279
and if we can

817
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,360
keep both of our jobs,

818
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
then we will get married for real.

819
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,519
Alright.

820
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,320
As for my parents,

821
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,199
we still need to keep

822
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:14,199
things as they are.

823
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,199
I don't want them to be concerned.

824
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:17,880
Absolutely.

825
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,040
Don't worry.

826
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,519
During this year,

827
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,560
I will definitely be a

828
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,400
competent rival.

829
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,439
I won't be slacking off either.

830
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,519
I've already drafted the agreement.

831
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,880
Within a year,

832
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,679
I must be converted to permanent

833
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,800
employee in section one,

834
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,600
and

835
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,160
secure ten million in deposits.

836
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,560
Alright.

837
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,400
Then within a year,

838
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,199
I'll double the performance of section one.

839
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,759
Isn't that a bit excessive?

840
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,959
Since it's an earnout agreement,

841
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,320
I need to show some sincerity.

842
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,279
But that is

843
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,719
an impossible task.

844
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,439
For others,

845
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,719
it might not be achievable.

846
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:58,919
But for me,

847
00:31:59,479 --> 00:31:59,840
it's workable.

848
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,600
Then I'll adjust my target too.

849
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:10,919
Fifty million.

850
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,519
Are you sure? It's a huge risk.

851
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:18,800
I can't let you suffer a disadvantage.

852
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,880
We need to be fair!

853
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,199
So during this year,

854
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,679
we need to work hard in section one

855
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,759
to fulfill our agreement,

856
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:42,320
and avoid causing trouble for each other.

857
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,519
Absolutely.

858
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:49,959
Good luck.

859
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,759
Good luck.

860
00:32:59,519 --> 00:32:59,880
Hello.

861
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:02,640
I'll be there shortly.

862
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,840
Yuheng previously worked

863
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,759
in the Compliance Dept

864
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,719
responsible for internal auditing.

865
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,479
He is familiar to many of you

866
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,120
and has had

867
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,199
interactions with most of you.

868
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,160
So I believe that

869
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,919
you will definitely

870
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:26,999
work as a team and

871
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,800
help section one out of its difficulties.

872
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,439
Do you have that confidence?

873
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:32,919
Yes, we do!

874
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,160
Fanggang,

875
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,479
you and Jing are both

876
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,479
experienced veterans.

877
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,040
I hope you can cooperate with

878
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,199
each other and work as a team.

879
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:43,719
Yes, sir.

880
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:44,519
You can rest assured.

881
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:45,919
In our section one,

882
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:46,759
we focus on

883
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:48,040
unity and teamwork.

884
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,479
Mr Ji,

885
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,279
if you need anything,

886
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll be available 24/7.

887
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,919
Thank you, Mr Zhao.

888
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:57,919
No problem.

889
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,519
Sir, ease your mind.

890
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:00,439
I will also

891
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,279
fulfill my duties.

892
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,679
Great, that sounds reassuring.

893
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,239
Whoa, so early.

894
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,320
Mr President.

895
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,479
- Li Xiang. - Xiaoning.

896
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,120
Your name tag.

897
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:10,999
The meeting

898
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,040
has been going on for half an hour.

899
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:12,959
Where have you been?

900
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,360
I had a diarrhea.

901
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:20,959
Yuheng,

902
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,080
from now on,

903
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,040
I will leave section one

904
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
to you.

905
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,519
Don't worry, sir.

906
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,279
I will definitely do my best.

907
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,120
I'm leaving.

908
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,000
You guys continue.

909
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
Take care.

910
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,319
Have a safe trip back, sir.

911
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,080
Goodbye.

912
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:35,920
Take care, sir.

913
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,759
Later.

914
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,440
It's OK.

915
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,279
Please sit down.

916
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:22,199
Let's start by

917
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,120
getting to know each other.

918
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,839
My name is Ji Yuheng.

919
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:26,040
I previously worked in

920
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,520
the Compliance Dept.

921
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,920
In the past few months,

922
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,239
we should have run into each other.

923
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,560
From today onward,

924
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,799
we are a team.

925
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,000
Section one

926
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,359
has indeed faced some challenges before.

927
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,239
Now, while the issues

928
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,319
have been resolved.

929
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,199
They have still taken a toll on us.

930
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:44,600
I hope

931
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,879
that in the near future,

932
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,000
we can prepare together

933
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,759
for tough challenges ahead.

934
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Let's start with me.

935
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,480
I'll introduce myself.

936
00:35:58,799 --> 00:35:59,359
Rao Jing,

937
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,960
a senior account manager for 8 years.

938
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,239
Nice to meet you.

939
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,359
I'm Zhao Fanggang.

940
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
I've been a senior account manager

941
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,319
for 7.5 years.

942
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:14,759
I'm Xu Li,

943
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,719
an account manager,

944
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,399
five years.

945
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,719
Liu Xiaomang,

946
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,960
account manager for 3.5 years.

947
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm Shen Shuyao.

948
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,120
I've been an

949
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,279
account manager for 3 years.

950
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,160
Now it's my turn, right?

951
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,440
I'm Li Xiang,

952
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,319
an account manager,

953
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:28,839
for 6 years.

954
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:31,960
I'm Yao Shiyun.

955
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,759
An account manager

956
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,839
for 3 years and 2 months.

957
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,040
I'm Zhang Xiangdong.

958
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,199
An account manager for 5 years.

959
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,040
I am

960
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,960
an assistant to account managers.

961
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,160
I haven't been made permanent yet.

962
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,560
My name is

963
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,199
Tu Xiaoning.

964
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,279
So among us,

965
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,600
except for Tu Xiaoning,

966
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,080
everyone here has over 3 years

967
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
of experience as account managers.

968
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,160
So in terms of work experience

969
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,160
and qualifications in the industry,

970
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:05,719
you all are my seniors.

971
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,120
From now on,

972
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,440
I look forward to working with you.

973
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,120
Mr Ji,

974
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:11,440
you're being

975
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,799
overly modest.

976
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,600
Nice to meet you all.

977
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:18,799
Let's all go out to eat together.

978
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,199
I'm buying.

979
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,319
Mr Ji,

980
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,000
since you are new,

981
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,160
you might not be familiar with

982
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,839
the daily business here.

983
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,120
We don't have

984
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,040
a typical 9-to-5 schedule.

985
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,759
After work,

986
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,839
we still need to entertain clients.

987
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:33,239
So,

988
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,279
we really don't have time

989
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:34,960
to join you for dinner.

990
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:35,759
I'm sorry.

991
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,359
Oh yeah, Xu Li,

992
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,239
aren't we meeting

993
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,679
with Mr Li tonight?

994
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:44,279
That's right.

995
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,040
We can't make it either.

996
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,279
Sorry about that.

997
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,799
We have plans tonight as well.

998
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,080
That's fine.

999
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,520
So,

1000
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,799
maybe another time.

1001
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:54,279
I won't hold up everyone.

1002
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,239
Let's wrap up the meeting.

1003
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,279
Right.

1004
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,759
Be patient.

1005
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,960
Could you pass

1006
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,000
the... um...

1007
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,480
contract with Guangcai

1008
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,160
to me?

1009
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,080
Ms Tu Xiaoning,

1010
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,839
are you currently in

1011
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:48,359
a new relationship?

1012
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,839
Not only is it based on actual marriage,

1013
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,560
but you've also become

1014
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,279
Ji Yuheng's...

1015
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,640
Don't mention his name.

1016
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:57,960
What if someone hears it?

1017
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:01,879
Don't worry about it.

1018
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,839
Office romance,

1019
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,080
while fraught with risks,

1020
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,839
is also quite exciting.

1021
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,960
We are in a clear and honest

1022
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,560
relationship.

1023
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,279
Yeah, sure,

1024
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:12,560
clear and honest.

1025
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,839
I'm serious.

1026
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,399
We truly haven't

1027
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:16,679
gotten there yet.

1028
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,239
You kidding?

1029
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,759
You're both in your 20s.

1030
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,239
Is he incapable in that department?

1031
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:26,359
Nonsense.

1032
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,239
What's incapable?

1033
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,199
It's nothing.

1034
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:38,279
Mr Ji.

1035
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:47,920
Is that all you're having for lunch?

1036
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,080
Their instant food are quite good.

1037
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,239
You should give them a shot next time.

1038
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,239
You're really good at role-playing.

1039
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,600
Very convincing.

1040
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:14,640
Alright then.

1041
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
I'll leave you girls to it.

1042
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:18,839
Drink it while it's hot.

1043
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:27,839
What's this?

1044
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm done.

1045
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,520
Clean it up for me.

1046
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:32,520
You're leaving already?

1047
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,520
Ms Rao has been in there

1048
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,480
for quite a while.

1049
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,359
Why hasn't she come out yet?

1050
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,679
Looking for me?

1051
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:57,719
No.

1052
00:41:58,359 --> 00:41:59,920
Then get ready for a meeting.

1053
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:01,879
Tu Xiaoning,

1054
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,120
on your toes. We have a meeting.

1055
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,359
What meeting can we have at noon?

1056
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:05,239
Why don't you

1057
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,239
just go and ask Mr Ji?

1058
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:07,679
I think he will give you

1059
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,520
a satisfactory answer.

1060
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:09,719
Also,

1061
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
the lunch break

1062
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
has already ended 3 minutes ago.

1063
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:13,759
I heard that Mr Ji

1064
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:14,520
doesn't like waiting.

1065
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,920
A new broom sweeps clean.

1066
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,679
And the first sweep

1067
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,759
is on me.

1068
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,359
Alright.

1069
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:24,759
I'd like to see

1070
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:26,080
what new tricks this amateur

1071
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,199
will come up with.

1072
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,480
Mr Ji.

1073
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:52,839
He really likes the mint ones, huh?

1074
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,000
Let's use this one.

1075
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,120
My parents say the mint ones

1076
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,719
makes teeth cleaner.

1077
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:10,120
Most people like it.

1078
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,279
And you don't have to accommodate me.

1079
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
I'm not picky.

1080
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,759
I just think that

1081
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:16,799
every corner of the house

1082
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,279
should reflect what we both like.

1083
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:21,560
Then let's

1084
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,040
get them both.

1085
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,239
That will come with 20% off.
