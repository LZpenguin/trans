[EP21]

3
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,200
[Mr. Liu,]

4
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,399
can we

5
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,200
meet up

6
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,119
and talk about it?

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,720
The commercial loan you've applied for

8
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,759
can't be converted to a combined loan,

9
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,399
but can only be switched to a housing loan.

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,280
Right.

11
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,679
That depends on

12
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:00,679
the balance in your

13
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:01,239
account.

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Don't worry,

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,080
I won't pressure you to buy.

16
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,080
Right.

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,399
I can explain that.

18
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,039
And it's up to you

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,200
whether you accept or not.

20
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,479
It's definitely

21
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,440
a better deal

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,200
than a commercial loan.

23
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:16,160
[You see,]

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,479
[you and my boss]

25
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,280
[are both from]

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,840
[the same hometown.]

27
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,720
Looking at it this way,

28
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,240
you're the person

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
he should respect.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,879
Isn't that right?

31
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,240
[Okay.]

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,759
[Let's meet up in the next few days.]

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,720
Alright.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
See you then.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,759
Bye.

36
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:33,280
Xiaoning,

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,319
the way you're

38
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,560
making calls now

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
is just like

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,799
certain someone.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,160
[It doesn't feel like]

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,199
[I'm your mentor at all.]

43
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,120
That Zhao...

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,359
What's wrong?

45
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,240
I am just

46
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,680
drawing on your strengths.

47
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,879
Getting close to clients.

48
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,919
As long as I can

49
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,599
get them to meet.

50
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,120
That makes sense.

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,280
Guys!

52
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,720
It's payday!

53
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:57,879
You need to

54
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,680
hurry confirm

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,240
your payment status.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,400
Leave your signatures,

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
and collect your pay slips.

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,799
That's great.

59
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,319
Ms. Rao,

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,560
I'll get it for you.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,359
Hey,

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,479
what are we? Why do I need you to do it?

63
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,840
You don't know

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,759
what we are?

65
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,319
What?

66
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
We're creditor and debtor!

67
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:20,840
Alright then.

68
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,599
Got it.

69
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,479
Some debts

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,199
can be postponed,

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,520
but some

72
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,759
can't.

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll get it right away.

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,160
Yuhui,

75
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,759
why aren't you going?

76
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,599
I'll go after I finish this task.

77
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,160
[It's payday!]

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
[You need to sign to get your pay slip.]

79
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,759
[Could you help me take it?]

80
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,319
[That wouldn't be appropriate.]

81
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,160
[You're authorized.]

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,160
Done.

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Sign here if you get it for others.

84
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,120
Got it.

85
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:11,799
Here you go.

86
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:12,400
For Ji Yuheng.

87
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,280
Thank you.

88
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,560
Why are you picking up

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
Yuheng's pay slip?

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,039
Ms. Rao just message me,

91
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:22,919
asking me to get it for Mr. Ji.

92
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:24,960
Why do you ask?

93
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,560
No wonder.

94
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,840
I thought you weren't that close to him.

95
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,320
Tang Yuhui.

96
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,520
Come here.

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,760
I've transferred the money to you.

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
We're cleared.

99
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,760
What's this?

100
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,320
You just transferred it back.

101
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Drinking with you in Xihai,

102
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,679
cooking for you during the New Year,

103
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,479
changing your tires,

104
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:56,320
bringing you breakfast,

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,200
and making coffee for you...

106
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,320
Should all these be free?

107
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,559
You're raising the price, huh?

108
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,160
Yup!

109
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,479
Name a price.

110
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,799
How could you

111
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,439
agree so easily?

112
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,359
You're not happy to get your money back?

113
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,200
When I loaned you the money,

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,039
I felt being forced.

115
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:08,400
When it comes to repaying,

116
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,439
I'm still forced to accept it.

117
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,200
Why am I always

118
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,999
the one being forced?

119
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:11,880
Allow me to refuse.

120
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:13,880
What do you want?

121
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,359
You'll have to repay me when I ask you to.

122
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,840
Now you have the money back.

123
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,840
You still owe me.

124
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,479
And I'd like to take advantage of it.

125
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,280
Go to lunch with me.

126
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,080
No way.

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
You know I'm someone

128
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,359
who has no boundaries.

129
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
If this thing accidentally

130
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,720
got out to everyone,

131
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:29,999
then your dignity as Ms. Rao

132
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:30,520
would be undermined.

133
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
I am not afraid of that.

134
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm not sure about that.

135
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,200
But you know my talent for

136
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,239
exaggerating and

137
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,080
stirring things up.

138
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:39,919
If you wanna turn this

139
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,559
simple matter

140
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,239
into a complicated one,

141
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,479
you could certainly try.

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
Hey, Mr. Zhao,

143
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:44,679
you've put in so great efforts

144
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,119
to buy me lunch, huh?

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,520
Are you feeling right?

146
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:48,559
I am unwell.

147
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:49,999
Sick.

148
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,439
So a patient wants you

149
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,080
to have lunch together.

150
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,080
Is that wrong?

151
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:54,919
Is it contagious?

152
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:55,919
Nope.

153
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:58,160
OK, let's go then.

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,239
Here, take a bite.

155
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,439
Be careful, it's hot.

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
How is it?

157
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,160
Is it similar to what you make?

158
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,799
Not quite the same.

159
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,200
It's even better

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,840
than mine!

161
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,239
Come on, mom.

162
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,200
I was just thinking,

163
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,599
if I over-salted it

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,679
or made it too bland,

165
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:32,799
or maybe it wasn't

166
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:33,679
cooked enough.

167
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:35,720
It's good!

168
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,119
Xiaoning,

169
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
you've really

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,200
done a lot lately.

171
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,080
You've been coming here every day,

172
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,640
taking care of me.

173
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,679
And you even made dumplings today.

174
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
You must be exhausted.

175
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,960
Not at all.

176
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,799
No worries.

177
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,559
Seeing you get better every day

178
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,880
makes me really happy.

179
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
I'll eat later.

180
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,119
OK.

181
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,799
I'll just leave it here for now.

182
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:07,039
Mom,

183
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,280
Yuheng just got his paycheck.

184
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,400
I took a peek,

185
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,799
and there's a big sum of money!

186
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:12,999
We can go on a

187
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,280
luxurious road trip!

188
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,520
Really?

189
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,320
Mom, where do you want to go?

190
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,160
Let's go on a road trip!

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,999
I'll take you out to have some fun.

192
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,439
Sounds fantastic.

193
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
Yuheng

194
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,280
should be back soon, right?

197
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,479
He should

198
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
be back from

199
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
a business trip tomorrow afternoon.

200
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,039
I'll come with him

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,919
to pick you up.

202
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,599
Good.

203
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Xiaoning,

204
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,479
I can eat by myself.

205
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,840
You should take a break.

206
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,919
You've been busy all day.

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,840
Just take a nap.

208
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,960
I'm good, really.

209
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:15,720
You want to eat by yourself.

210
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,760
That's fine.

211
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,119
I'll just go wash the dishes,

212
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,080
and I'll be back soon.

213
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Take care.

214
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,880
Xiaoning,

215
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,400
these dumplings

216
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,760
are yummy.

217
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,080
Thanks.

218
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,839
Hello?

219
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,559
How's the deal going?

220
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,719
Is everything going well?

221
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,360
The contract has been confirmed

222
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,799
with their accounting and legal teams.

223
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,439
So it went well.

224
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:17,240
Good.

225
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000

You

229
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,520
have arrived at the airport?

230
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,600
Yeah.

231
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,520
After the meeting,

232
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,400
I bought the ticket right away.

233
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll be in Xingcheng tonight.

234
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,120
Mom was just talking about you.

235
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,240
She misses you.

236
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,600
If she knew you're coming back tonight,

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,719
she would be so happy.

238
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:36,799
OK.

239
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,360
Let's meet tonight.

240
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,839
OK.

241
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,079
Take care.

242
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:42,520
OK.

243
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:59,079
Let's go check it out!

244
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,400
Excuse me.

245
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:56,439
Excuse me.

246
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,839
Mom!

247
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,240
Mom!

248
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,679
Please step outside.

249
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,039
I know.

250
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,679
Let me see her.

251
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,400
Don't interfere with our rescue efforts.

252
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,199
Excuse me.

253
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,919
My mom must be scared all by herself.

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,439
Mom!

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,240

256
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,559
Mom!

257
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,520
Please stay outside.

258
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,280
Mom, are you alright?

259
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,679
[Please.]

260
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,319
- Calm down!
- Mom!

261
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,839
Yuheng will be back soon!

262
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,880
Allow me in!

263
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,079
Mom!

264
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,839
Mom!

265
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,160
I'm really sorry.

266
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,160
We did our best.

267
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,679

268
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,360

269
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,959
Please try to save her!

270
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,880
Please stay calm, OK?

271
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,360
Her son will be back soon.

272
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,439
Please don't give up on her!

273
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,000
Doctor!

274
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:19,839
Doctor!

275
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,280
Let go of me!

276
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,120
- Doctor!
- Please calm down.

277
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,959
I can't!

278
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,120
How can I calm down?

279
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,079
Mom!

280
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,079
Mom!

281
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,120
Mom!

282
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,559
Yuheng will be back soon.

283
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,360
Mom,

284
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,199
just wait for him, please!

285
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,240
How can I explain

286
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,559
this to him?

287
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,280
Xiaoning.

288
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,880
Mom.

289
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,719
Mom.

290
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,799
Xiaoning.

291
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,319
It's OK.

292
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,520
I'm here.

293
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,280
Mom.

294
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,400
How could this happen?

295
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
She was fine in the morning.

296
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Her spirits were really high.

297
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,480
She even said

298
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,280
that the dumplings I made were yummy.

299
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,880
She was chatting and laughing with me.

300
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,919
She kept asking me

301
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,160
when Yuheng would be back.

302
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,919
Mom,

303
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,839
days ago, she's fine

304
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,839
when we returned to our hometown.

305
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,160
It's all my fault.

306
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,079
I just stepped out

307
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,880
to wash dishes,

308
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:37,760
then this happened.

309
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,240
If I hadn't gone out,

310
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,400
she would have been fine.

311
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,199
No,

312
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,480
it has nothing to do with you.

313
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,240
It's OK.

314
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,880
She

315
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,600
kept asking me earlier

316
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,439
when Yuheng would be back.

317
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,760
Mom, do you think

318
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,520
that she actually

319
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,959
sensed something?

320
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,400
She wanna see her son one last time.

321
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
But she didn't even get that chance.

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,559
When Yuheng comes back,

323
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,919
I don't know how to explain it to him.

324
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,039
What can I tell him?

325
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,480
It's OK.

326
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,760
It's alright.

327
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,120
Mom.

328
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,959
Yuheng.

329
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:10,240
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,439
It's OK.

331
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,760
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:16,799
I'm back.

333
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,919
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:06,839
Here.

335
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,319
Mom,

336
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,480
aunt is here to see you.

337
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:41,959
Aunt,

338
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,800
my mom often thinks about you.

339
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,919
She must be happy

340
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,479
to see you here.

341
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,199
Your mom has

342
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,759
had a tough life.

343
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,040
She finally enjoyed a few days...

344
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,160
Aunt.

345
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:07,600
Please take care of yourself.

346
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,199
Please, this way.

347
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:28,759
- Yuheng.
- Mom, dad.

348
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:30,800
It's

349
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:31,600
almost done

350
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,080
in here.

351
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Is there anything else

352
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,800
that we can help you with?

353
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:37,040
Nothing.

354
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,560
Thank you so much.

355
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,479
We're family. No need for thanks.

356
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,999
If you need us,

357
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,719
just let us know.

358
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,360
You must be tired after such a long day.

359
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,360
You should get some rest.

360
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:50,560
Dad, mom,

361
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,919
you should also get some rest.

362
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:17,719
Xiaoning,

363
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,120
my condolences.

364
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,320
Later, Qi Yu and I

365
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,479
will buy you food.

366
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I know you don't have

367
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,759
much of an appetite,

368
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,759
but you need to take care of yourself.

369
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,600
If something happens to you,

370
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,320
Ji Yuheng will be devastated.

371
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,880
I know.

372
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,840
This is a token from me

373
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,439
as your mentor.

374
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:48,679
Here.

375
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:49,439
Take it.

376
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,279
My condolences.

377
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,239
Jing,

378
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:53,400
I...

379
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,560
My relationship with Mr. Ji...

380
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,400
No worries.

381
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:58,999
Don't say it.

382
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,400
I already know.

383
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,199
I should have figured it out sooner.

384
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,800
Nothing can be hidden from you.

385
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,600
I have a feeling that

386
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,759
something has happened between you.

387
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,679
But I didn't expect

388
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,919
you two to go this far.

389
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Actually, we haven't...

390
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,400
Last time I went to the hospital

391
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,600
to visit Mr. Ji's mom,

392
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,560
I already knew.

393
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
And I saw that you and your mother-in-law

394
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,279
were quite close.

395
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:26,679
Now that she's gone,

396
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:27,719
you must be very sad.

397
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,040
Keep it up.

398
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,439
Take care of yourself.

399
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,880
I'm leaving now.

400
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,679
They left?

401
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:13,600
Yes.

402
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,479
All of them?

403
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,279
C'mon, what do you wanna say?

404
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,679
I planned to invite you

405
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,320
for afternoon tea.

406
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,479
But facing such an incident,

407
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,360
it wouldn't be appropriate for us

408
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,560
to go out and have fun.

409
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,959
Why do you say that?

410
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,800
The dead have gone.

411
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,959
Those living must continue to live, right?

412
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,120
I realized it

413
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,719
at the moment

414
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,519
I lost my parents

415
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,199
so long ago.

416
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,400
You were so young

417
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,800
to handle a funeral.

418
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,759
That must be tough.

419
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:53,800
It's been too long.

420
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,439
I can't remember.

421
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,160
But you...

422
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,400
Why do you

423
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,919
suddenly seem so refined?

424
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:02,999
Having afternoon tea?

425
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,840
I...

426
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,199
pursue...

427
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:06,999
a fulfilling life.

428
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,919
The ambiance matters, you know.

429
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:08,600
Cool.

430
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:09,959
Let's go for it!

431
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:10,640
OK.

432
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:11,959
I'll just grab my bag.

433
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,919
I'll drive.

434
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,400
I never thought you would

435
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,679
actually buy me afternoon tea.

436
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:19,719
And even

437
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:20,719
at such a charming place.

438
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,040
But I'm concerned

439
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,360
that after I take a sip,

440
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,959
you might ask me to split the bill.

441
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:26,800
Am I really that

442
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,999
stingy to you?

443
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:30,759
No,

444
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,759
you're just frugal.

445
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,160
Alright then.

446
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,719
Today, your little jab

447
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,439
at my character

448
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,400
ends here.

449
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,360
Let me show you

450
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,279
what true generosity looks like.

451
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,320
Waiter!

452
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:06,600
I was just wondering

453
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
why you would treat me

454
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
to afternoon tea out of the blue.

455
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,719
You helped a friend buy a bag.

456
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,279
You want me to check it out for you?

457
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:14,759
Alright then.

458
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:15,959
You know,

459
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,040
if you're worried about

460
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,439
getting a fake one,

461
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,040
you should have come to me.

462
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,120
A purchasing agent wasn't necessary.

463
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,160
I bought it from the store.

464
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:26,759
Give it a try?

465
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,959
There's really no such thing as

466
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,120
a free lunch in this world.

467
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:35,439
I have to help you try it on?

468
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,519
Well, since I'm here,

469
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,640
I might as well help you out.

470
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,439
Let's see how it looks.

471
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:42,719
Good?

472
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,080
Totally.

473
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:45,040
Really?

474
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,919
It suits you perfectly.

475
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,880
Do you like it?

476
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,719
What do you mean by that?

477
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:53,959
Just as I said.

478
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,160
This bag

479
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,719
is a gift for you.

480
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,479
I was planning to wait for a

481
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,519
special occasion to give it to you.

482
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,679
But I thought

483
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,600
you might be feeling down today,

484
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,160
so I decided to give it to you now.

485
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:15,919
How did you know

486
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:16,919
I was feeling down?

487
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,679
Just a little while ago.

488
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,999
You looked at Mr. Ji three times,

489
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,400
and your eyes turned tearful twice.

490
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,439
You even turned away to avoid being seen.

491
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,120
Honestly, I noticed something was off

492
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,439
about you back in Xihai Town.

493
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:30,959
Rao Jing,

494
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,679
we've known each other for so long.

495
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:33,800
You don't need to

496
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,759
put on a front with me.

497
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,600
I won't

498
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,479
wrap it up for you.

499
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,320
I see there's a receipt.

500
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,279
You could sell it for a good price

501
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,279
in a second-hand market

502
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,199
What do you mean?

503
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,679
I'm not taking it.

504
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:07,919
Rao Jing!

505
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:10,439
Rao Jing!

506
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,840
Why are you leaving?

507
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,600
If you don't like this one,

508
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,199
no problem.

509
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm going all out here.

510
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,959
You can choose one you like.

511
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:15,840
Zhao Fanggang!

512
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,040
Who am I to you?

513
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,519
Why spend so much on me?

514
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,999
Even if you won the lottery today,

515
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:20,719
you shouldn't be spending

516
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,479
any part of it on me.

517
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:25,880
Also,

518
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:27,880
why do you care so much about me?

519
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,360
My eyes turned red.

520
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,239
I was looking at Mr. Ji.

521
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:30,999
My condition was bad.

522
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,360
What does this have to do with you?

523
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,199
Are you the type who,

524
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,160
as long as you have a romantic interest,

525
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:35,880
you're this

526
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,600
attentive and caring?

527
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,519
How warm-hearted you are!

528
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,360
Rao Jing,

529
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm confused.

530
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:44,999
Cut to the chase.

531
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:45,719
What do you wanna say?

532
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,239
I mean,

533
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:51,439
I've noticed

534
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:52,759
you're being serious with me.

535
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,719
That's right.

536
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:02,360
So what?

537
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:06,959
Listen.

538
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,999
If it's just for fun

539
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm game for anything,

540
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,360
no matter how extreme.

541
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,360
We're all adults here.

542
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,999
Single.

543
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,160
Bored.

544
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,560
Just looking for fun.

545
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,160
But if you

546
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,320
are serious about this

547
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,919
and want a stable relationship...

548
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:21,479
I'm sorry.

549
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,279
I'm not looking for that.

550
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,880
Zhao Fanggang,

551
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,400
you're taking this way too seriously

552
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,919
that it's hard for me to keep up.

553
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,040
So,

554
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
you're eager to return the money,

555
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,239
just to draw a line with me.

556
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,320
No need to draw a line for flirting.

557
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,959
I'm drawing a line for seriousness.

558
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,759
And right now, you've crossed it.

559
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,239
It's just not fun anymore.

560
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,320
So in your eyes,

561
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,479
I'm no different

562
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:22,479
from those boys that

563
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,160
you fool around with.

564
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,160
I'll go boil some water

565
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,560
for you to soak your feet.

566
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,040
Alright?

567
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:45,279
I'll get your flip-flops.

568
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:45,679
Darling.

569
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:49,560
Sit here.

570
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,239
I want to talk to you for a bit.

571
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,800
In the future,

572
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:03,080
if you want to go out and dance,

573
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,279
just go ahead.

574
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,360
I don't mind

575
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,519
if your dance partner

576
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:08,919
is Lucy or Lily,

577
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,919
whoever.

578
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,080
As long as it makes you happy.

579
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,840
I've come to understand.

580
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,279
We're at an age where

581
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,040
we're already retired.

582
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,360
The kids have their own lives now.

583
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,560
We should

584
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,719
do things that

585
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,320
make us happy, right?

586
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,199
If we have fun things to do

587
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,360
every day, then...

588
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,719
It's OK.

589
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,439
No worries.

590
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,880
From now on,

591
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,279
I always take you

592
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:51,919
with me when I

593
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,719
go out to dance.

594
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:53,239
Alright?

595
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,320
I'll teach you if you don't know how.

596
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,479
If you don't like it,

597
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,439
we can do something

598
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,840
you enjoy,

599
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,999
like shopping

600
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,199
together,

601
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,800
finding someone to play cards with,

602
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,040
or exploring

603
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,999
the mountains and rivers.

604
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:08,360
Good?

605
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,479
In the past,

606
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,400
I always thought

607
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,719
that life was long ahead of us.

608
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,400
But after this,

609
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,239
I suddenly realized

610
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,320
that life is unpredictable.

611
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,479
So let's cherish every moment.

612
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,560
I just can't accept it.

613
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,279
How could one person

614
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,919
just vanish like that?

615
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,880
Today, when I saw Yuheng's lonely image,

616
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,800
I couldn't help but wonder,

617
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,239
what if it were us?

618
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,400
Xiaoning...

619
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,759
What would happen to her?

620
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,080
Here.

621
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,360
No matter what,

622
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,519
it's impossible

623
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,759
to be there for the child forever.

624
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,360
Right?

625
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,519
But we can

626
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,439
start living

627
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:08,400
a healthy life

628
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:09,600
from today.

629
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,840
We can maintain a positive mood.

630
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,840
That way,

631
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,479
we can stay

632
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,479
with our daughter

633
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,360
longer.

634
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,120
Right?

635
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,719
I'd like to soak my feet.

636
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,239
OK.

637
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,239
Let me take off your shoes.

638
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:33,999
One sec.

639
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,360
You've been worn out these days.

640
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,400
I can see the red veins

641
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,519
in your eyes.

642
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,400
You should get some rest.

643
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm fine.

644
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,719
Now it's just the two of us.

645
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,919
If you have anything on your mind,

646
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,239
you can share with me.

647
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,600
If you're

648
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,759
sad,

649
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,199
you can hold me and let it out.

650
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:27,919
Would that help?

651
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:38,999
It's alright.

652
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,439
I'm OK.

653
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:41,719
Don't worry about me.

654
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,880
I'm just a little tired.

655
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:50,439
I understand.

656
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,800
Get some rest.

657
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,719
I'll go cook.

658
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,400
Let me handle it.

659
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,840
Turn on the lights,

660
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,120
it'll make you feel better.

661
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,999
I know you're sad,

662
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,040
and you don't have much of an appetite.

663
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,040
You should eat a little.

664
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,719
Otherwise, mom would worry about you.

665
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,160
OK.

666
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,719
How is it?

667
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,719
Good?

668
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,479
Mom said that

669
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,279
it tastes

670
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,279
as good as

671
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,600
what she made.

672
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,600
I thought I'd never have

673
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,560
this flavor again.

674
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,879
My mom has gone.

675
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,879
She'll never come back.

676
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,600
I don't have a mom anymore.

677
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,440
While sorting through mom's belongings,

678
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,920
I found this album.

679
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:50,359
Take a look.

680
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,759
In the hospital,

681
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,719
she always wrote

682
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,879
and drew in it

683
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,839
Turns out, it was all for you.

684
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,279
You've never seen these, have you?

685
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,040
This was from when I was two.

686
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:34,040
I had a birthday party.

687
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,759
When I was in kindergarten,

688
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:40,879
I even took gymnastics classes.

689
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,799
In the future, when we have these photos,

690
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:49,040
we can put them in here.

691
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,719
Take a look further.

692
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,080
You have more.

693
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,199
Mom left you some words.

694
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
[Yuheng,]

695
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,960
[I'm in the hospital again.]

696
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,759
[This time,]

697
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,399
[I don't know how long I can be with you.]

698
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,839
[Because of my condition,]

699
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,679
[you gave up your dream job]

700
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,520
[but to work in sales.]

701
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,920
[You've been working so hard.]

702
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,040
[I know it clearly.]

703
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,839
[I feel so guilty.]

704
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,520
[But more than that,]

705
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,080
[I feel heartbroken.]

706
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,199
[One day I'm no longer here,]

707
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,199
[I hope you can find peace,]

708
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,679
[and do things you love.]

709
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,319
[Live happily]

710
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,000
[with Xiaoning.]

711
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,600
[Our family's journey,]

712
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
[though brief,]

713
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,560
[has been meaningful all along.]

714
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,640
[With your dad,]

715
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:19,879
[you,]

716
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,560
[and Xiaoning by my side,]

717
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,520
[I feel truly content.]

718
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,679
[Thank you, Yuheng.]

719
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,920
[Your dad and I]

720
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,799
[will always]

721
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,879
[watch over you.]

722
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,040
Mom can rest easy knowing

723
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:52,679
that the two of us

724
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,560
will take good care of ourselves.

725
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,440
We definitely will.

726
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:39,600
Morning.

727
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,879
You've already made breakfast?

728
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,359
You...

729
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,319
Are you

730
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,040
gonna work today?

731
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
I'm planning to take a break.

732
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,560
I need some time to heal.

733
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,199
I'll go ask for leave later.

734
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,679
I'll be here for you.

735
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:15,040
No need for that.

736
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,160
Just focus on work.

737
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:19,279
Don't worry about me.

738
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,480
I won't do anything

739
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,520
that would make you worry.

740
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:24,120
[He has to]

741
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:25,640
[find his way]

742
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,920
[out of this all by himself.]

743
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,359
OK.

744
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,640
[You look good.]

745
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,080
About this filling,

746
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,719
the key is the oil.

747
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:05,960
Mom, you look great in photos.

748
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,679
Listen to me.

749
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:09,920
First,

750
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,799
you need to use hot oil to activate it.

751
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:16,120
But,

752
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,600
you must be

753
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,359
careful not to use

754
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:21,640
too much oil.

755
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:22,920
Or

756
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,600
it'll be greasy.

757
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,799
One more thing.

758
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,920
It must be cooked

759
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:29,920
on low heat

760
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,520
to avoid making it burn.

761
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
Then, you'll get a good flavor.

762
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,679
This really is a meticulous job.

763
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:35,839
Looks okay.

764
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,040
Does it smell good?

765
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,600
Alright.

766
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
Now pour out

767
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,199
the oil.

768
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,199
Mom, don't worry. I'll get it right.

769
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,920
I'll handle the cooking.

770
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:50,879
I won't let you wear yourself out.

771
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:53,239
Never mind.

772
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,399
I can do it

773
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,600
