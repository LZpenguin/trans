English subtitles are available

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,760
You Are My Secret EP32

3
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,959
Actually, from that moment on,

4
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,640
I've already had feelings for you.

5
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm jumping now!

6
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:05,319
Go ahead.

7
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,200
I've been eating a bit too much lately.

8
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,360
You have to catch me.

9
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,080
Don't worry.

10
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm strong enough to catch three of you.

11
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:11,679
Come on.

12
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:12,840
Give me your hand.

13
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,039
Come on.

14
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Oopsy!

15
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm just too heavy.

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
That's why you couldn't catch me.

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,879
It's OK.

18
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,199
Ling Weiyi!

19
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,560
You've got to say yes to him!

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We, business school totally

21
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,000
owes the win to Qi Yu,

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,799
our aid.

23
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,840
Guys, that's a beauty trick, a cheap shot!

24
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,840
It's cool, Weiyi.

25
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,479
Just say no to him.

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,520
Next year, we

27
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,359
will bring Qi Yu onboard

28
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,639
and we'll kick your butts!

29
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,400
Whether you win or lose the game

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,319
doesn't concern me.

31
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,919
Anyway, I'll support

32
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,680
whatever team Qi Yu is on.

33
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,680
Whoever has him will win!

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Does that count as a "yes"?

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,319
Not so fast!

36
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,160
Do you really like me?

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
Will you treat me better than

38
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,639
anyone else in the world?

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,160
Of course!

40
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,840
OK then.

41
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,799
Do you still like me?

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,120
If you like me, then you do.

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
If you don't, then you don't.

44
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,199
Stop dragging it out.

45
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,400
That's not like you at all.

46
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,479
Honestly, I want to

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,239
call you to apologize every day.

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,239
But I've realized that

50
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,200
this time, an apology might not work.

51
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
You don't need to apologize to me.

52
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,999
You haven't done anything wrong.

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,919
It's just that we have

54
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,720
some issues between us.

55
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,679
Actually, we

56
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,439
don't necessarily have to

57
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,479
resolve these issues,

58
00:04:59,359 --> 00:04:59,999
right?

59
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:03,840
I like you,

60
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,239
and you like me.

61
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,080
So why do we have to

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,239
sulk every day,

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,599
worrying about

64
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,320
money,

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,880
houses,

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,160
and all those issues?

67
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,840
Can't we just love each other

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,119
and enjoy a passionate romance?

69
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,039
This way,

70
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,960
I don't have to change myself,

71
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,080
and you

72
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,679
don't have to

73
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,200
bear such great pressure.

74
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:25,960
Right?

75
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,200
Weiyi,

76
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,999
I understand you're unhappy with this,

77
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,280
but I'm even more dissatisfied.

78
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,280
But I can't help

79
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,359
think about our future.

80
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,679
But who can really predict the future?

81
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,200
Let's just live for the present,

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,559
and be happy for the present.

83
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,080
We agreed on this before!

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,400
To watch the sunrise and sunset together.

85
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,239
If it rains,

86
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,720
we'll cozy up at home and watch movies.

87
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,160
If it's sunny, we'll go hiking.

88
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,799
Surfing in the summer,

89
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,439
skiing in the winter.

90
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,200
If I couldn't fall asleep at night,

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,999
you'll go to the beach with me.

92
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,359
Isn't that kind of life wonderful?

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,999
We can't just

94
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,479
be in love forever without facing reality.

95
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,039
If there's no future,

96
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm just wasting your time.

97
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,439
So,

98
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:45,960
you've already made up your mind

99
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,359
that you want to break up with me, right?

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,239
Ling Weiyi,

101
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,919
let's break up.

102
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,119
You deserve someone better.

103
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,119
And I'm not the

104
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,080
right person for you.

105
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,080
I remember we

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
watched a show before.

107
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,960
Autumn in My...

108
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,200
Stop it!

109
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,119
Are you so eager to find another girl?

110
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,919
That show was a tragedy, right?

111
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,880
But I believe

112
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
we will definitely not end up like that.

113
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,599
You will be good,

114
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,720
and I will be good too.

115
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
We will always

116
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,799
be together.

117
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,320
Never apart.

118
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,520
Why did you only run

119
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,600
for half an hour today?

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,919
I already ran for an hour

121
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,000
before you arrived.

122
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,520
I was hoping to

123
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,679
exhaust myself,

124
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,679
so I wouldn't be so heart-broken.

125
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,000
But I realized that the more tired I get,

126
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,360
the more I crave someone to lean on.

127
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,559
Come on.

128
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,679
Lean on me.

129
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
I'm really glad you're here.

130
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,120
But aren't you supposed to be

131
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,959
finding new clients again

132
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,160
because of that scum Mr. Fu?

133
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,480
Isn't being here with me

134
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
taking up your time?

135
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,079
My bestie just went through a breakup.

136
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,039
I won't be able to concentrate on work.

137
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Forget about work.

138
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,160
Even if a

139
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,679
billion-dollar client comes knocking,

140
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,160
I won't be going to work.

141
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:39,640
My only priority today

142
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,439
is to be here with you.

143
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,280
If it's a billion-dollar client,

144
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,079
you definitely should go!

145
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,520
What if your bestie

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,439
ends up breaking up again

147
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,480
in the next couple of months?

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,600
You'd miss out on the chance

149
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,919
to become the world's richest person.

150
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,400
Can you stop being so negative?

151
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,039
This breakup

152
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,079
is your last one.

153
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,400
The next guy you are going out with

154
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,559
will definitely be someone

155
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,799
who genuinely cares for you,

156
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,959
and treats you right,

157
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,919
someone who can share a lifetime with you.

158
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,799
As for this time,

159
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,160
let's just chalk it up to a regret.

160
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,039
You know, in a lifetime,

161
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,079
how can anyone go without regrets?

162
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,039
Having no regrets at all

163
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,160
would be rather dull,

164
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,039
don't you think?

165
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:27,799
Let me grab my phone.

166
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,319
Xiaoning,

167
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,559
your friend, Mr. Yu

168
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,280
made a significant deposit today.

169
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,880
The clients

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
you've secured recently

171
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,480
are also moving into the approval process.

172
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,799
We've hit the target for this month.

173
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,319
You can relax and take your annual leave.

174
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,919
And enjoy some quality time

175
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,120
with your new husband.

176
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:47,959
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ji.

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,120
My bestie is going through a tough time.

178
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,719
You should take a back seat for now.

179
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,360
Lean on me.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,600
Where do you want to go?

181
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,160
I'll take some time off soon.

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
Wherever you feel like going, I'm down.

183
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,400
I want to go alone.

184
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,799
That's not an option.

185
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,600
I can't let you do that.

186
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,799
I had been with Qi Yu

187
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,799
for so many years.

188
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,319
We had been through so much together.

189
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,719
I think it's time for me to

190
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,600
spend some time alone

191
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,799
to really sort things out.

192
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Don't worry about me.

193
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,039
I won't be

194
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,839
single forever.

195
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,439
I won't do anything rash either.

196
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,520
Once I'm feeling better,

197
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,319
I'll find my way back.

198
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,160
Just like I did last time.

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,079
Someone mentioned back then

200
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,000
that whenever she had a vacation,

201
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,959
she would go spend some quality time

202
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,880
with her Mr. Ji.

203
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,839
Alright, don't worry about me.

204
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,719
I just want to take some time for myself.

205
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,640
How could I possibly not

206
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,520
worry about you?

207
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,160
I've been waiting for you for a while.

208
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,839
I have some exciting news.

209
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,880
The loan for the new energy company

210
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,839
that you personally negotiated with

211
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,199
is already in the approval process.

212
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,319
As long as we secure this

213
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,039
top-tier client,

214
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,559
It will lay a solid foundation for

215
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,400
the future development of

216
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,280
our Jian branch.

217
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,719
Once we start

218
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,439
comprehensive cooperation

219
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,120
with them,

220
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,520
we won't have to worry about

221
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,400
our performance for a long time.

222
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
That sounds like great news.

223
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,919
But still, you need to

224
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,719
keep a close watch on everything.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,480
Don't worry.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,280
By the way,

227
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,039
I'm taking the annual leave

228
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,640
along with the Mid-Autumn Festival.

229
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,760
Mr. manager,

230
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,719
in the coming days,

231
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,120
make sure to pay extra attention.

232
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,240
Mr. manager?

233
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,679
You

234
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,240
called me

235
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,679
Mr. manager.

236
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,839
What do you mean by that?

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Hon,

238
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,000
let me help you put the apron on,

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,240
so you won't stain your white dress.

240
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:58,559
This is amazing!

241
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,480
I did some research.

242
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,799
Having hot pot occasionally

243
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,439
is really not a big deal.

244
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:04,120
Told ya.

245
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Also,

246
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,600
having some milk tea now and then

247
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,439
is perfectly fine.

248
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,439
Told you that as well.

249
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,000
Your milk tea

250
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,039
is almost finished.

251
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,760
I'll get you another one.

252
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,799
Get me a cold one.

253
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,799
No way.

254
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,400
Fine, a hot one then.

255
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,640
It's perfectly fine for me

256
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,799
to enjoy some hot pot and milk tea,

257
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,120
but I think you might have a problem.

258
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,640
What problem do I have?

259
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,360
Getting promoted to department manager,

260
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
are you really that excited?

261
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:30,959
Did you prepare this

262
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,480
lavish feast just for me?

263
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,559
What else could it be?

264
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,520
To put it grandly,

265
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,679
my career

266
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,280
has reached a significant milestone.

267
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,360
To put it simply, at home,

268
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,520
I can finally stand on equal footing

269
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,919
with Ms. Rao.

270
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,280
Congrats.

271
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,839
This is a huge occasion.

272
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,079
Hot pot and

273
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,799
milk tea would be nothing.

274
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,000
Even if you want to hit the club tonight

275
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,880
and check out some hot dudes,

276
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,480
I'd greenlight it.

277
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,240
I didn't do it last time, seriously.

278
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,319
Now that sounds more like it!

279
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,919
Besides, those dudes

280
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,000
can't hold a candle to my charm.

281
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,719
Exactly!

282
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,719
Come on,

283
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,640
have a piece of meat.

284
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I've had a ton. You dig in.

285
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,760
I knew it.

286
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,000
Yuheng is

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,719
always reliable

288
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,839
and never makes empty promises.

289
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,280
You're still

290
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,240
praising him to the skies, huh?

291
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,600
You still don't realize that

292
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
he promoted you

293
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,280
to department manager

294
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,839
just so he could

295
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,839
offload all the work onto you

296
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,000
and then enjoy

297
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,319
his annual leave

298
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,280
with his

299
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,199
newlywed wife.

300
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,160
Where's my milk tea?

301
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,079
Did you order it?

302
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,280
Nope,

303
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,799
too much milk tea isn't good for you.

304
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,600
Believe it or not, I'll pour

305
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,319
this whole thing on your face.

306
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,640
It's already on the way.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,360
Dig in.

308
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,439
Hello there!

309
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,880
Could you please take a photo

310
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,679
for my wife and me?

311
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,240
- Thanks. - Sure.

312
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,600
No problem.

313
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,079
Let's take a photo.

314
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,760
You two, come a bit closer.

315
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
Smile!

316
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,160
Let's see how it looks.

317
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,640
Looks fantastic. Thanks.

318
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,559
What do you think?

319
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:17,959
Thanks a lot.

320
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,039
No problem.

321
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,160
Mr. Ji mentioned that you can find him

322
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,959
through this kitty.

323
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:29,520
Good luck!

324
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,520
Let me hold the camera for you.

325
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,679
The story

326
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,600
begins with that kitty.

327
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,479
Why don't we go back and look for it?

328
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,120
It should still be around.

329
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:22,400
Never mind.

330
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Let's go.

331
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
I'll get a new one.

332
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,880
When I was in high school,

333
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,759
I also used this kind of eraser.

334
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:55,479
Take it.

335
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,519
Where did you get this umbrella?

336
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:09,800
Isn't this

337
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,360
from my dad's company?

338
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,279
How come you have one as well?

339
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,800
You remember this umbrella?

340
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,040
Of course.

341
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,800
When my dad was still working,

342
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,439
his company gave out these umbrellas

343
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,519
every year as perks.

344
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,600
We must have had at least

345
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,719
fifteen of them,

346
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,719
if not twenty.

347
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,959
Do you have any relatives

348
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:30,919
working at Puling too?

349
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,719
So, if the first guy approaching you

350
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,120
after high school graduation was me,

351
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,120
would you have said yes?

352
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,439
But in reality,

353
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,400
there are no "ifs".

354
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,840
Back then, you didn't even like me.

355
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,120
Life doesn't have "ifs".

356
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:57,719
So I would still

357
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,560
be with you.

358
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,519
If this morning,

359
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,840
that person wasn't me,

360
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,600
would you still

361
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
come to her rescue?

362
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,120
I would.

363
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,880
But if it were someone else,

364
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,600
I would do it as the supervisor.

365
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:25,999
But because it was actually you,

366
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,880
besides being your supervisor,

367
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,640
I'm also your future husband.

368
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,519
Is this how you

369
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,400
see yourself?

370
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,759
Tu Xiaoning, you weren't like this before.

371
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,519
You've changed.

372
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,360
Yeah, I've changed.

373
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,719
People do change.

374
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,199
Just look at yourself.

375
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:50,600
You've changed too.

376
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,759
You're no longer the

377
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,919
Ji Yuheng I knew.

378
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,120
Honestly, I have

379
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,360
many flaws as well.

380
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,719
I hope that

381
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,400
if you see

382
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,439
my ordinary side

383
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,479
or even my mediocrity,

384
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,919
you won't be disappointed in me.

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,320
And you won't despise me.

386
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,959
How could I ever despise you?

387
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,800
You are Ji Yuheng.

388
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,640
If you like me,

389
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,360
I am Ji Yuheng.

390
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,479
If you don't like me,

391
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,560
I'm just an ordinary folk you see everyday.

392
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,320
When we met again,

393
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,439
you gave me a home.

394
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:04,959
Thanks to you,

395
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,640
life is no longer a dull black and white.

396
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,679
It's filled with color.

397
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,840
I want to make one for our entire family.

398
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,239
With my dad and mom,

399
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,040
your dad and mom,

400
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:16,999
and the two of us.

401
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:17,999
Leave no one behind.

402
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,840
Thank you, my dear.

403
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:17,519
My Mrs. Ji,

404
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,400
on our road ahead,

405
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,840
please rest assured

406
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
to entrust yourself to me.

407
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:25,439
I will do everything I can

408
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,320
to make you happy,

409
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:29,479
to keep you safe.

410
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,080
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

411
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,120
Thank you

412
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,040
for giving me

413
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,840
such a memorable

414
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,279
and beautiful wedding.

415
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:42,279
Thank you

416
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,080
for being a part of my life.

417
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,840
Being with you

418
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,919
is the happiest thing

419
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,120
I've ever experienced.

420
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,080
Mom, dad,

421
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,719
today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

422
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,679
We came back to see you.

423
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,360
By the way, I have some

424
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,400
exciting news to share with you.

425
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,239
You're going to be grandparents!

426
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,919
I

427
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,800
am already married

428
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,880
and have my own family.

429
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,120
From now on, in this world,

430
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,840
I'm no longer

431
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,959
by myself.

432
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,040
The guy I married

433
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,279
isn't very tall,

434
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,239
and he's not

435
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,800
particularly good looking.

436
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,560
He's my colleague,

437
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:27,999
and

438
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,959
he loves me deeply.

439
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,439
Of course,

440
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,679
I love him too.

441
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,320
It's just that I don't

442
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,919
often bring that up in front of him.

443
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,199
By the way,

444
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,679
last time I came home,

445
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,640
he was also here.

446
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,360
Did you think

447
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,560
he is the right one,

448
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:53,519
so you sent him

449
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,439
to me?

450
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,040
Of course.

451
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,080
In your

452
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,160
parents' eyes, I must

453
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,519
be the perfect son-in-law.

454
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,479
Burn the incense.

455
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,120
Mom, dad.

456
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,040
Rest assured.

457
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,880
I

458
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,759
love Jing with all my heart.

459
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,239
My parents

460
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,199
adore her too.

461
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:29,999
I'll

462
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,120
always be there for her,

463
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,479
loving her,

464
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,199
accompanying her,

465
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:38,800
taking care of her,

466
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:40,919
She won't be alone anymore.

467
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:42,840
We'll come

468
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,279
visit you often.

469
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,160
I'm a bit

470
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,360
of a talker,

471
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:55,919
please

472
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,080
don't mind.

473
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,800
There, there.

474
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,919
It's okay.

475
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,239
It's okay.

476
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:30,600
Okay.

477
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:18,400
Now.

478
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:18,919
One.

479
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,600
Two.

480
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,080
Three.

481
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,640
Perfect.

482
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:22,519
Done.

483
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,880
I'm beat.

484
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,519
My feet are killing me.

485
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:29,840
I'm exhausted.

486
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,840
Aren't you tired?

487
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:32,999
You've been lifting

488
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:33,919
and carrying me around,

489
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,919
but looks like you're not even phased.

490
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,640
I'm usually

491
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,439
pretty strong, right?

492
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:41,759
Excuse me.

493
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,120
Could you guys do

494
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,880
a few more sets?

495
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,719
You're both so good-looking,

496
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,439
I'd love to use your photos

497
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,679
as sample images for our store

498
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,479
and put them online.

499
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,279
Absolutely,

500
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,519
we'll send you the photos

501
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,080
as soon as

502
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,800
they're done,

503
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,999
and we'll cut the price

504
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,999
in half for you.

505
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,279
Half?

506
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,479
I...

507
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,160
Sorry.

508
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,719
My wife's feeling a bit worn out,

509
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,640
so we can't do this favor.

510
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:01,880
It's okay.

511
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,640
We'll respect

512
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,360
your call on this.

513
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:03,999
Well.

514
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,199
Go ahead and change.

515
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:06,120
Thanks for your time.

516
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:06,640
Okay.

517
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,080
Thanks.

518
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,560
The discount

519
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,479
is pretty sweet,

520
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,600
why'd you pass it up?

521
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,199
I wanna keep your

522
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:14,919
beauty all to myself.

523
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,439
You had a different tune

524
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,919
yesterday during the fitting.

525
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,080
I gotta admit,

526
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,719
I don't wanna share

527
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,840
those hot pics

528
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
of you either.

529
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,840
I'll hoard them.

530
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,479
How?

531
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,959
It's a surprise.

532
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,400
Okay.

533
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,279
Thanks for being

534
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,719
so cooperative

535
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,479
during the shoot.

536
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,239
I love them.

537
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,279
No need to thank me,

538
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,600
we're in this together.

539
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,479
I love you.

540
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,640
You too.

541
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:18,400
Xiaoning looks stunning

542
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:20,320
in her wedding dress.

543
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:26,640
My little girl's

544
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,959
all grown up and married now.

545
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,439
Okay, okay.

546
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:33,919
Tu.

547
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:34,959
Enough.

548
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,479
It's our baby

549
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,840
girl's big day.

550
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,040
There, there.

551
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:45,679
Too bad, my

552
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,719
"Magpie Bridge" moment

553
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,199
isn't gonna happen.

554
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,439
Let's go

555
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,840
to that bridge

556
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,199
on our wedding

557
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,080
anniversary

558
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,840
and

559
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
and walk over everyone's

560
00:31:59,239 --> 00:31:59,840
heads.

561
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,600
How's that sound?

562
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,320
Yeah?

563
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,160
Sure.

564
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,320
And get

565
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,840
a fresh set of wedding pics.

566
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,360
Yeah.

567
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,279
Sure.

568
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,479
I wanna try on a wedding dress,

569
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,040
we missed out on that.

570
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,239
From...

571
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,800
Seeing her in white just

572
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,959
gets me choked up.

573
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,400
Okay, okay.

574
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,640
Everything's so familiar,

575
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,999
the smell, the place,

576
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,999
the sky,

577
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,040
the moon...

578
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,199
Buzzing?

579
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,239
Remember when

580
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,320
you were

581
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,919
spouting off about that

582
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,560
backpack theory?

583
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,279
It's been ages.

584
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,120
I

585
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,999
remember it all.

586
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,919
Your funny moment,

587
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,840
I'll cherish

588
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,759
and savor it.

589
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,959
You were

590
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,600
all "life's not worth it,"

591
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:55,999
"I envy your freedom" that day.

592
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,320
Come on,

593
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,479
just a little joke.

594
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,360
Sit.

595
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,360
Sit down.

596
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,400
Let's chat.

597
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:05,759
Anything goes, huh?

598
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,479
Yeah.

599
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,640
Alright,

600
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,640
let's chat then.

601
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,360
Later on that night,

602
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,880
some dude got wasted.

603
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,759
Next day, he was too

604
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,679
hungover to even

605
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:17,360
crawl out of bed.

606
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,640
In the hotel,

607
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,279
he was doing the S-walk,

608
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,080
like this, this, and this,

609
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,999
all the way up to the boat.

610
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,439
Okay.

611
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,600
Stop.

612
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:25,640
Sorry,

613
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,279
babe, my bad.

614
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,239
How about we agree never

615
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:32,640
to bring up our goofy past?

616
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:33,880
Just bury

617
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,360
those memories

618
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,679
deep

619
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
and forget

620
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,400
about them.

621
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:38,919
Okay?

622
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:39,999
No.

623
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,400
Hey, you're the one

624
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,479
who started it.

625
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,439
Who do you think you are,

626
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:45,479
king of the world

627
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,439
or something?

628
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,959
You're still at it?

629
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,959
Just bored, huh?

630
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,640
Picking on me for fun.

631
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,919
Thanks,

632
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,040
babe.

633
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,679
You really

634
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,640
know how to

635
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,479
spice things up.

636
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,679
I just want

637
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,040
a little peace now.

638
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:02,719
Okay.

639
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,679
Now.

640
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,519
Your choice.

641
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,360
I'll zip it.

642
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,759
Hey, how about

643
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:09,759
when we're back here

644
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:10,679
with the baby,

645
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,239
we throw a tiny

646
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,160
wedding

647
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,919
for just us three?

648
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:16,480
And let our

649
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,399
little one be our witness.

650
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,080
Yeah.

651
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:21,759
You're

652
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,359
the boss.

653
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,239
I'm all ears.

654
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,600
It's

655
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,239
gonna be epic.

656
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,879
And cost-effective.

657
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,040
Wedding's cool.

658
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,719
But cost-

659
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,960
effective?

660
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,600
You're a real

661
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,560
tightwad,

662
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,440
aren't you?

663
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,520
Just save where I can.

664
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,600
You know.

665
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:39,920
Who is it?

666
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:41,000
My dad.

667
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,399
Mom, dad.

668
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,799
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

669
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,359
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

670
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,120
Grabbed a mooncake yet?

671
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,160
Yeah.

672
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,520
And you?

673
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Yeah.

674
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,759
Jing.

675
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,839
Fanggang said you're

676
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,080
not sleeping well.

677
00:34:58,319 --> 00:34:59,759
So, I sent you some

678
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:01,279
homemade jujube powder

679
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,799
from our hometown,

680
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
all natural.

681
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,080
It'll be there

682
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,440
when you get back.

683
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,480
Why tell them

684
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,799
about that?

685
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:11,600
It's good for you.

686
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:12,440
Jujube really works for sleep.

687
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,319
It's too much trouble.

688
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:14,920
Give it a try.

689
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,279
Maybe your

690
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,040
sleep issues are from stress.

691
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:18,879
If you

692
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:19,960
you have time this weekend,

693
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,040
come here and

694
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,120
we'll take you around

695
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,839
to relax a bit.

696
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,000
Thanks.

697
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,199
And sorry,

698
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,839
Fanggang

699
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,080
and I should have been there with you

700
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,120
for Mid-Autumn Festival.

701
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,799
Silly girl.

702
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,440
It's not a big deal.

703
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,040
Visiting your parents'

704
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,040
grave is priority.

705
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,480
Family's family,

706
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,440
every get-together

707
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,640
is special,

708
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,679
right?

709
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:42,799
And

710
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,239
look up,

711
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,199
we're all under the same moon.

712
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,520
Yeah.

713
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:48,799
Right.

714
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:50,279
Dad.

715
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,000
Look.

716
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:52,520
The moon's

717
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,480
great, right?

718
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,560
I'll let you go now.

719
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:56,279
Dad.

720
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,520
Easy on the mooncakes.

721
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,399
Watch your blood sugar.

722
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,600
Gotta go.

723
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:00,440
Bye.

724
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,080
What's up?

725
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,440
Nothing.

726
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,759
Feels good

727
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,279
to have family,

728
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,600
to have you.

729
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:26,640
And when you smile, it's

730
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,640
beautiful.

731
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,399
Hold that grin.

732
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,199
I'm getting a shot.

733
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,839
The pretty smile.

734
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,040
Hold it,

735
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,440
don't move.

736
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,359
Get the baby in the frame.

737
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:35,719
Alright.

738
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,040
Okay.

739
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:37,080
Three.

740
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:37,960
Two.

741
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,440
One.

742
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:39,160
One more.

743
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,759
Three.

744
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,199
Two.

745
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:41,640
One.

746
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
And a selfie.

747
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,399
Three.

748
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:46,560
Two.

749
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,040
One.

750
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,359
Gonna post it to Moments.

751
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Their wedding pics?

752
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,199
Give it a like.

753
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,600
You see?

754
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,920
Talents entwined,

755
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,960
beauty and brains,

756
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,319
a union divine,

757
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,960
love that remains.

758
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,640
With that mouth of gold,

759
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,000
you should be

760
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,920
on stage,

761
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,640
not behind a desk.

762
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,440
You're a comedic gem.

763
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,600
You're just

764
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,319
green with

765
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:22,679
envy.

766
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,080
Of my golden mouth

767
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:24,960
and

768
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,040
my rhymes.

769
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:30,799
What's up?

770
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,520
I think...

771
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:35,799
What?

772
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,120
I'm getting

773
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,319
some kicks in there.

774
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,319
Really?

775
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:46,759
You hear that?

776
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:48,640
Yeah.

777
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:51,440
Babe.

778
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,679
I feel it.

779
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,080
Stay strong, little one.

780
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:56,359
You're

781
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,440
almost here,

782
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,000
and we're gonna

783
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,879
love you to pieces.

784
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:02,359
Listen, don't copy your dad's

785
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:03,480
smooth-talking ways.

786
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:04,759
Stick to your books

787
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:05,920
and forget about

788
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,799
stand-up.

789
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,160
I love you, babe.

790
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:14,679
I love you.

791
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,120
Happy Wedding.

792
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,279
Tu Xiaoning.

793
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,160
At least one of us is happy,

794
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,120
that's what counts.

795
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,359
It's nice.

796
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,040
Will I see

797
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,520
the sunrise today?

798
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:18,839
Morning.

799
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,879
Morning.

800
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,359
Morning, boss.

801
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,040
Morning.

802
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,399
Morning.

803
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:31,839
Morning.

804
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,199
Morning.

805
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,000
Morning, Tu.

806
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,600
Morning.

807
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,920
Morning, Tu.

808
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,160
Morning.

809
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,359
Over the next month,

810
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:41,279
I'm gonna go through

811
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:42,759
our corporate accounts,

812
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,719
explore their funding needs,

813
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,839
and then offer some

814
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,560
tailored services.

815
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,799
Well.

816
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:48,920
Yuan Lang.

817
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,319
Tingting.

818
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,160
And Xiaoning's apprentice.

819
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,000
You three,

820
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,640
just work well

821
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:54,719
together with your boss.

822
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,560
No problem.

823
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,520
No problem.

824
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,759
You're all about the lobby,

825
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,520
leaving BDD

826
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,440
in the dust?

827
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,520
BDD has you, Manager Zhao.

828
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,319
Think

829
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,080
you can't cut it?

830
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,040
I

831
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,960

832
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:12,600
But show some love to BDD, will ya?

833
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,120
By the way.

834
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,080
Got a client

835
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:16,199
meeting this afternoon.

836
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,120
Come with me.

837
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,600
You got jobs for me?

838
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,600
Just make sure you're on board.

839
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:26,920
Tu.

840
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,440
You...

841
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,960
Hustling hard

842
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,839
after the promotion, huh?

843
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,199
You're really outdoing yourself,

844
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,440
even Jing can't keep up

845
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,719
with your work ethic.

846
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,319
Aw, come on.

847
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,399
You're flattering me.

848
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,600
I'm no match for Jing.

849
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,000
Almost time.

850
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:43,160

851
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:44,040
meeting at 1.

852
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,279
Early bird catches the worm.

853
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:45,799
I gotta go.

854
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,440
Okay.

855
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:47,480

856
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,000
Okay.

857
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,239
You got it.

858
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:50,960
Mr. Liu.

859
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,000
This is Mr. Ji,

860
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,080
the President of Ji'an Branch.

861
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,440
Mr. Ji.

862
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:55,480
Heard so much about you.

863
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,000
Hello.

864
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,920
I'm Ji Yuheng.

865
00:41:59,199 --> 00:41:59,719
This way.

866
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,440
You remember

867
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,560
today's the big day, right?

868
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,040
Bye.

869
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,399
Of course.

870
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:45,199
Anniversary

871
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,399
feels simpler than

872
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:48,319
the wedding,

873
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,839
yeah?

874
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,199
Nah.

875
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,160
Just us two, together,

876
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:55,960
it's all good.

877
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,319
So, Mrs. Ji, how's married life

878
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:05,839
treating you this year?

879
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:06,839
Satisfied?

880
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:08,759
Yeah.

881
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,399
Just simple,

882
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,960
but super happy.

883
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:15,920
Mr. Ji.

884
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,399
Got any visions

885
00:43:17,399 --> 00:43:18,759
for our married life

886
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:19,960
ahead?

887
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,199
I just want

888
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,279
every day to be

889
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:25,879
like this

890
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,160
simple

891
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,640
but super

892
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,239
happy.

893
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:32,120
It will be.

894
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:34,960
It will be.
