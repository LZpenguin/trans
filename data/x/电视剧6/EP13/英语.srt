2
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,679
Xiao Tu

3
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,080
Is it okay

4
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,280
Have taken the medicine

5
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,280
Thank you, Mr. Ji, for your concern

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,959
It's okay

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,039
Confirm

8
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,840
Confirm

9
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,720
It's okay

10
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:15,360
Didn't see the leader

11
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,119
I'm quite concerned about Xiao Tu

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
Care for subordinates

13
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,919
It's also the responsibility of the department manager, right?

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hope Xiaoning

15
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,079
Become a regular as soon as possible

16
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,599
Also help us reduce some

17
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:28,479
Performance pressure

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,520
Okay

19
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,840
Good attitude

20
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,759
Our department

21
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,479
It seems that it's just you and Xiao Tu

22
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,960
Good match for the age of the leader

23
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,359
Is it right

24
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,079
Neither is that senior brother

25
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,919
Anyone can take a fancy to it

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,759
You see

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,680
joke

28
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,280
Be jealous

29
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:49,680
Mom

30
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,799
Don't worry about it

31
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,160
Xiaoning, she may be

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,879
I've got some colds

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
Discomfort in the throat

34
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,079
I just wanted to ask you

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,359
When she was sick earlier

36
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,079
What medicine to take

37
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,160
Can you get better faster

38
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,079
Steamed oranges

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
It will be fine after eating it for a day

40
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,039
You wait

41
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,240
I'll send it to you when I'm done

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,160
It's okay

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,280
Please don't bother

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,960
I'll do it

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,079
That's fine too

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
Then I'll send you the recipe

47
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,639
Just do what you do

48
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:10,199
Okay

49
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,919
That's troublesome, mom

50
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,319
Sir, please pick oranges

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,560
Right

52
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,440
This breed

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,479
Let's have an activity today

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,079
Half price

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,359
Buy three catties and get three catties free

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,199
Here's some for you

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,919
Is there anything with better quality

58
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
Better maybe no activity

59
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:29,960
It's okay

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
That breed over there

61
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,440
Directly supplied from place of origin

62
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,199
Extra fresh and sweet

63
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,240
Okay

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,960
Then can you help me with a few

65
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,680
Good

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,720
Mom's asleep

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,720
After taking the medicine, my mother fell asleep

68
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,720
Just in time

69
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:51,880
It's a coincidence

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,479
Mom said you ate this when you were a kid

71
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,799
The cold can heal faster

72
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,799
Be careful of burning

73
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:06,960
Forget

74
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,880
But it's also my first time doing it

75
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,119
Looks like there's too much salt

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,080
It's okay

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,359
Too much salt

78
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,320
Only then can it be effective

79
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:15,400
Really

80
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:24,599
OK

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,119
OK

82
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,200
It's okay

83
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,080
As soon as I walked in the door

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
Mom asked me to take my temperature

85
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:33,960
No fever

86
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:35,919
That's because my hands are too cold

87
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
It's okay

88
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,919
Don't make such a fuss

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,919
Even if it's okay

90
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,320
I can't review any more today either

91
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,439
Go back early to rest

92
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,359
Good

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,599
Is it a little sour

94
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,520
It's a little salty

95
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:02,799
No

96
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,200
I'll do it for you again

97
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,039
Don't Don't

98
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,520
I finished this today

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,919
Tomorrow will definitely be fine

100
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,200
Why don't you eat another one tomorrow morning

101
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,919
Consolidate it

102
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,200
No problem

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,840
I'll make it for you

104
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,200
That is

105
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,720
Is it possible

106
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,359
Put a little less salt

107
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,439
Of course you can

108
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:26,320
Good

109
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,359
Sunrise and sunset and starry sky

110
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes, I think

111
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,359
The most beautiful scenery

112
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,999
Have you with me to feel

113
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,080
It's really good

114
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:21,799
What does it feel like

115
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,720
Isn't that

116
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,039
The feeling of being in love

117
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,919
At that time, you went back to your hometown

118
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,359
I thought you really did

119
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,599
Won't come to Star City again

120
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,799
I was just thinking

121
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,799
Later these romances

122
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,479
But something boring

123
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,559
There may really be no one

124
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,679
Will accompany me to do it

125
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,280
Now I'm back

126
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,200
I'll be with you all these things from now on

127
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,520
Not leaving

128
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,720
Tomorrow night is New Year's Day

129
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,799
New Year

130
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,880
I can not be alone again

131
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,080
Tomorrow

132
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,919
Let me give you a New Year present

133
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:15,960
Really

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,960
What is it

135
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,320
Don't tell me yet

136
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:26,960
All right

137
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,760
How are you doing

138
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,919
I'm listening to you now it seems like

139
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Not coughing much

140
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,559
Are you still taking the medicine

141
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,960
Eating

142
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,840
Three meals a day

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,760
Didn't fall behind once

144
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:41,479
Let me ask

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,359
Xiaoxiaoning

146
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,239
There's an exam tomorrow, right

147
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,719
Dad has a good idea

148
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:46,839
Otherwise I

149
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,120
Go to the door of your bank

150
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,880
Pull a banner

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
How about fuel you up

152
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,919
Let your mom go too

153
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Let your mother wear a cheongsam tomorrow

154
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,240
This is called a victory

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,719
How about it

156
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
I'm not going. It's embarrassing. You go

157
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,120
Mom, why don't you give it to my dad

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,280
Take the whole medicine

159
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,439
You're right, I'll tell you

160
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,880
Your father doesn't talk about it for a day

161
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,559
He feels uncomfortable

162
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,760
Let's be serious

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,079
Why don't I take tomorrow

164
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,679
I'm wearing a clothes with a hood

165
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm pretending to be that now

166
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
Fashionable for girls nowadays

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,000
I like to call it

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,719
This way this way

169
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:16,799
What's it called? What's it called, Bell

170
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,520
THAT THAT

171
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:17,880
fox

172
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,520
The fox

173
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,120
I really don't need it, dad

174
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:20,919
I know

175
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,079
You want to give me some relief

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,959
I'm not nervous at all

177
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:24,839
Don't worry

178
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,719
That's good

179
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
Okay, come on, come on

180
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,799
Come on

181
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:28,959
Bye

182
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,439
I have used

183
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:36,360
The power of metaphysics

184
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,039
I will definitely pass the exam

185
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,559
Love you

186
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,880
Where you are in my heart now

187
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,959
Top the list

188
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,919
Individually pinned

189
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,360
Pull it down

190
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,679
You're on top of your heart

191
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,839
It's in the bedroom wardrobe

192
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,600
Ji Yuheng who kissed you

193
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,480
Since now

194
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,760
Already under the same roof

195
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,000
The progress bar can be pulled up

196
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
No matter how beautiful that face is

197
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,640
I have to get off the field and practice it

198
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
Why is your face so red

199
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,799
Couldn't you have a fever again

200
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,439
No

201
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,400
It was a cold before

202
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,280
Not thoroughly yet

203
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,280
Let me see

204
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
This face is not hot either

205
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,000
It doesn't seem like a fever

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,719
Not a fever

207
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,959
Didn't you say it thoroughly?

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,400
Just

209
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,799
My own body

210
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,760
I know very well

211
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,839
It's fine if it's not a progress bar

212
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
Why are you eavesdropping on people

213
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,120
How did I eavesdrop

214
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
I walked in generously

215
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,559
Chat with you generously

216
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:48,839
It's you

217
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,199
With Ling Weiyi

218
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,160
Chatting so vigorously

219
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,839
questioning my

220
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,839
No No No

221
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,480
You heard it wrong

222
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,039
I'm going to sleep, please go

223
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,559
So suddenly

224
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:02,919
Come out

225
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,600
Don't

226
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:04,839
Come out

227
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
I have an exam tomorrow

228
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,160
In case it breaks down

229
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,520
Blame me if you don't play well tomorrow

230
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,600
Have a good rest

231
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:41,360
Just all the way

232
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
I didn't hear you coughing either

233
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
It should be almost fine

234
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,959
Remember to drink some water later

235
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,520
Got it

236
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,400
I'll pick you up after the exam

237
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,919
Booked a restaurant

238
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,760
Eat together

239
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,880
OK

240
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,240
I'm leaving

241
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,439
Come on for the exam

242
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,799
Off work

243
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,559
It's on holiday

244
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,959
I wish you all a happy New Year's Day holiday

245
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,360
Get high

246
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,719
Manager Zhao

247
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,640
So high

248
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,799
Don't go home and stay in a nest during the holiday

249
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,799
Learn from others' young people

250
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,360
Go out and spend 80 cents

251
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,079
This lady

252
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,679
I'm now in my capacity as a creditor

253
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,719
Seriously inform you

254
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,520
On January 1st, please

255
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,000
Before the clock strikes zero o'clock

256
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,079
Settle off the interest promised to me

257
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:46,520
Otherwise I will put the interest

258
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,400
plus principal

259
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,480
The power of this rolling profit

260
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,400
You understand

261
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:51,919
I'm sorry, Manager Zhao

262
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,760
I was a little young and frivolous just now

263
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,480
It's okay

264
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,600
If I guess correctly

265
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,799
You have eighty cents on you now

266
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,559
Can't even take it out

267
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,880
Manager Rao

268
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,199
Are there any activities on New Year's Day

269
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,760
Yes

270
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,600
What if you accidentally die

271
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,679
I have an activity

272
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,679
I can still have a dinner

273
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,319
Celebrate the festival

274
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't say such unlucky things

275
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,280
If you don't have any activity

276
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,160
I can reluctantly

277
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,919
Make an appointment with you

278
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,360
The right is to help the poor

279
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,880
Don't be reluctant

280
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,839
Help me the poor

281
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:21,760
I'll put it later

282
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,839
QR code transferred to you

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,880
You can just transfer the money to me

284
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,559
Don't buy that rice flour oil

285
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,120
cheap

286
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
And our family doesn't cook

287
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,799
Is your mouth red

288
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:29,240
arsenic

289
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,520
I didn't just have a date with you

290
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,520
Didn't Xiao Tu just finish the exam

291
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,439
Let's have a meal together

292
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,039
It can be regarded as relieving her stress

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,679
Not Brother Zhao

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,120
Did you make an appointment with the leader

295
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:42,880
Make an appointment

296
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,719
Was rejected by him

297
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,360
He said he was going to have dinner with his family

298
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,199
Then Manager Zhao is really embarrassed

299
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,199
It seems that our little Tu

300
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,079
I have to refuse you, too

301
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,719
People also have to eat with their families

302
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,799
And right

303
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,799
Make it look like

304
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,880
They're like a family

305
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:57,439
That

306
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,480
scattered

307
00:14:59,079 --> 00:14:59,439
That

308
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,839
Otherwise

309
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,880
scattered

310
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,120
Everyone goes back to their homes

311
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,000
Everyone looks for their own mother

312
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm sorry

313
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,679
You did it on purpose

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,079
Driving and wearing high heels

315
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,559
Be careful I'll find the traffic police to report you

316
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,839
I have flat shoes in my car

317
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,919
Thanks goodbye

318
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,959
Goodbye Sister Jing

319
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:20,600
Goodbye Sister Jing

320
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,319
Sister Jing, bye

321
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,760
Goodbye Brother Zhao

322
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,839
That toe

323
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:26,480
trampled flat

324
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,480
Go

325
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,761
The restaurant has a nice environment

326
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,960
Why didn't Mom follow me

327
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,200
Mom's a little tired

328
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,521
Thinking of taking a rest at night

329
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,800
I've been hungry all day

330
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:49,920
Take a look

331
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:51,040
Order your food

332
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,601
This restaurant is a bit expensive

333
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,040
It is said that the quality of this place is pretty good

334
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:07,320
But I haven't been here either

335
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:09,361
But just the two of us

336
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,521
I do think it's a little expensive

337
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:12,720
Or else

338
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,001
Let's change another one

339
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,080
Let's take a look at the menu first

340
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:17,720
It's this time

341
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,320
A slightly better restaurant

342
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
I guess they're all fully booked

343
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,560
If we must go

344
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,960
Maybe I can only return

345
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:25,720
The noodle shop at the entrance of the community

346
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:27,481
New Year's Eve

347
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,361
Go to the noodle shop at the entrance of our community

348
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,161
It's a little shabby indeed

349
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:32,960
Really shabby

350
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:34,881
Why don't you try

351
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:36,960
All right

352
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,361
It's been a year of hard work

353
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
Think of it as a comfort to us

354
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,440
Not extravagant either

355
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,320
Exactly

356
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,080
Hello

357
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,281
Your order has arrived

358
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,920
Thank you

359
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,800
Please use it slowly, you two

360
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:08,680
Good

361
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,241
I haven't ordered it yet

362
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,001
The food is coming

363
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:16,680
You've already booked it

364
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:18,680
This is after all

365
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
After we were together

366
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,560
First New Year's Eve

367
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,481
It must have a sense of ritual

368
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:23,800
Don't worry

369
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,760
Just a candlelight dinner like this

370
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,480
Mr. Ji can still afford it

371
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:30,200
What are you telling me about noodle shops

372
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,121
Really

373
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,561
Then you invite me to dinner

374
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,720
Let me share with you a

375
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,520
Good news

376
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,280
Good

377
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
I think I did pretty well in the exam

378
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,480
Case analysis

379
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,680
After the exam

380
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,920
I reviewed it several times

381
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,480
I think there's absolutely no problem

382
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,480
What's next

383
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,760
What you want to test is

384
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,280
Expand customers independently

385
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,841
Then wait for this time

386
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,561
After the holiday is over

387
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:54,841
I'm about to start looking for clients

388
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,801
This sounds like a steady one

389
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,361
That's even more worthy of celebration

390
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,720
Thank you, Mr. Ji

391
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:11,480
This Xiaoji

392
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,440
So thoughtful

393
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,000
You see

394
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,000
Ordered so much delicious food

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,841
And brought us over

396
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,401
Really

397
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,841
It's too grand

398
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,641
The child has a heart

399
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Is it a holiday

400
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:22,641
Just an atmosphere

401
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,121
lively

402
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,081
Yuheng and Xiaoning

403
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,440
After we are together

404
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm really happy a lot

405
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,081
Before

406
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:33,801
I'm because

407
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,361
Causes of one's own body

408
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,881
Chinese New Year and holidays

409
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,161
rarely handled

410
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,401
The house is always deserted

411
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:43,601
After that

412
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,520
If you want to

413
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:46,920
This is for the Chinese New Year and the holidays

414
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,081
Let's go together

415
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:49,841
That's good

416
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,680
I haven't been at home for a long time

417
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,881
It's been so lively

418
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,121
Otherwise

419
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:00,000
Why don't you move to our house

420
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:05,841
OK

421
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,161
Then you move to our house

422
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:09,920
She's got company after that

423
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,041
Out here

424
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:13,041
Take a walk or something

425
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,881
She wouldn't have to stare at me all day

426
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,720
No, what do you mean

427
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,520
You don't take a walk with me

428
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,161
Why are you going

429
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:21,280
Find someone to dance

430
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:21,920
I I

431
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:22,601
This man

432
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm going to do something else

433
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,161
I play chess and fish

434
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:27,480
All right, you

435
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,480
My real in-laws

436
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,561
I'm serious

437
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,000
Since Xiaoning

438
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:32,680
After moving out of the house

439
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,161
Our house is quite deserted, too

440
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,401
If you go

441
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,041
Isn't this house bustling

442
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,641
It's too intrusive

443
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,641
How much trouble would that give you

444
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,401
What's the trouble

445
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,801
But about adding a pair of chopsticks

446
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:45,680
Think about it

447
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:46,641
Where's the two of us

448
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,161
You can talk and chat

449
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,440
It's okay, let's go shopping

450
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,280
Buy shopping

451
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:51,920
If you decide anyway

452
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,280
Both of us will pick you up immediately

453
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,680
Right

454
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,321
The home is very spacious

455
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:56,041
accommodate

456
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you, thank you

457
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,920
Think about it

458
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,881
This song is pretty nice

459
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,280
Look at this

460
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
How can we be as handsome as Xiao Ji

461
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:09,561
Is it not

462
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,041
If this time

463
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,200
If I go well in the exam

464
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,960
So what's on our VAM agreement

465
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,601
Key Performance Indicators

466
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,641
Even if I

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,881
It's almost done

468
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:21,720
Twenty percent

469
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:22,960
Twenty percent

470
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,361
That's going a little fast

471
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,801
What about you

472
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,561
Tell me

473
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:34,801
The two of us

474
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:36,960
Are friendly competitors

475
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,601
Why are you still hiding it?

476
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,000
Share it with me

477
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:43,881
You wouldn't

478
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,161
Is it half done already

479
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:46,920
Of course not

480
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:48,720
Our department

481
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:49,920
There are only so many customers

482
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,240
How many more can I hide

483
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Don't let you know

484
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,440
Then you are the leader

485
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,321
Your secret words

486
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,161
I don't know

487
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:58,601
There really isn't

488
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
OK, that's good

489
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,561
Xiaoji

490
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,041
You have to work hard

491
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,881
Good leadership

492
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,841
Xiaoning

493
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,801
Actually, I'm asking you out today

494
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,000
Come to this restaurant

495
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,401
There's something I want to tell you

496
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,000
You say it first

497
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,680
It's okay

498
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,680
You answer the phone first

499
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,881
I'll go to the bathroom

500
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,801
Good

501
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,561
Hello

502
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:56,601
Weiyi

503
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,321
What's wrong

504
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:58,361
Where are you

505
00:21:58,881 --> 00:21:59,720
I don't know

506
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:01,520
Qi Yu made an appointment with me

507
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
A place I've never been to before

508
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,200
One of his own hasn't arrived yet

509
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,361
What about you

510
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,401
What are you doing

511
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:07,920
Do you want to come with me tonight

512
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Go to New Year's Eve

513
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,361
The bell tower I heard

514
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,801
There are fireworks tonight

515
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:12,960
No need

516
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,801
Ji Yuheng and I

517
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,041
On this side of Wutong Road

518
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,641
What about eating in a western restaurant

519
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,841
We won't watch fireworks together at night

520
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:21,920
I heard that restaurant is too expensive

521
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,561
He ordered it

522
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:24,801
He should be

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,240
It's been arranged a long time ago

524
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,161
What a coincidence

525
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,081
He was about to follow me

526
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,121
Say something about it

527
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,361
You just called

528
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,200
He doesn't want to confess his love to you, does he

529
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,121
I won't tell you anymore

530
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:14,960
Come back

531
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,561
Is it urgent to call you

532
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,760
It's okay

533
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,760
Nothing happened

534
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,121
Good

535
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:23,641
Eat it quickly

536
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
What are you gonna tell me

537
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,161
Nothing

538
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,161
Is there enough food

539
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,161
Would you like some more

540
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:47,760
Come

541
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,881
Cut the cake

542
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,121
Are you really

543
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:54,841
Don't you have anything to tell me

544
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,041
Why do you suddenly ask

545
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Come and cut it quickly

546
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,720
There's really no ring

547
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,760
How about it

548
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Is the taste okay

549
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,841
Delicious

550
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:32,680
This is a new store

551
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,081
This is from their shop

552
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,121
Main flavor

553
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,520
Weiyi

554
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,561
No flowers

555
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:58,841
No cake

556
00:24:59,081 --> 00:24:59,960
And no gifts

557
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:02,200
So my New Year's surprise

558
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,801
What is it

559
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:09,720
Right now

560
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:18,401
Look

561
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
It's the setting sun

562
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,760
Sunrise and setting starry sky

563
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:31,121
The best thing in the world

564
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:31,720
It all belongs to you

565
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Sunrise and sunset and starry sky

566
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,440
It's what I think in this world

567
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,601
The most beautiful thing

568
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:40,920
He remembers

569
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:44,240
If this moment

570
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,121
It would be nice to stay forever

571
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,520
Look

572
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:08,881
Here it is again

573
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:21,200
Come

574
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,121
Here's what we're doing today

575
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:10,361
How many times did you watch the sunset?

576
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,361
fifth time

577
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:16,801
This is the first time in my life

578
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
So seriously

579
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,280
Say goodbye to the sun

580
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,161
Thank you Qi Yu

581
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,121
Here is what I have received

582
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,200
The best gift

583
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,280
Be careful

584
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,081
Xiaoning

585
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:36,960
Actually, I have a saying

586
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:38,760
I want to tell you

587
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,161
No way

588
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:42,480
Now

589
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,881
On the street

590
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,841
You tell me

591
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:49,401
I want to say

592
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,440
What happened to my mother

593
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:53,801
Mom, what's wrong

594
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:55,720
Is there anything going on

595
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
My dad, he

596
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,240
Wasn't he buried in his hometown

597
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:00,920
After I came back from abroad

598
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,041
I've never seen him

599
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:04,081
I'm thinking that after the end of the New Year

600
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,081
Take my mom with me

601
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
Go see him

602
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:08,520
If you want to

603
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,321
Just come with us

604
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,520
It doesn't matter if you don't want to

605
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:14,561
Of course I do

606
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,440
I accompanied my mother to visit my father

607
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,121
This is not

608
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,401
Is it a normal thing

609
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,440
I just didn't expect

610
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,801
You're gonna tell me this

611
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:23,881
I thought

612
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,801
You

613
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:27,480
With why

614
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,480
Nothing

615
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,161
I'm a little hungry

616
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:36,561
Me too

617
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,561
Later

618
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,041
Don't go to such an expensive restaurant

619
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,041
And expensive

620
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:43,680
The portion of food is small

621
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,601
Come

622
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,041
Numbers one hundred to one hundred and twenty

623
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:49,280
You can start ordering

624
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:50,480
What is your number

625
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,440
Thank you

626
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,280
OK thank you

627
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,240
Thank you

628
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,240
Come to the menu

629
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,720
Thank you

630
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,121
Hello

631
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,081
that

632
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,480
Excuse me, I wanted to ask

633
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,000
We have all set meals here

634
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,000
Don't you have a single one

635
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,480
Excuse me, ma'am

636
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,601
There are too many people celebrating the holiday today

637
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:13,920
And we prepare the food

638
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,161
Also according to the set meal

639
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,321
If you order a la carte

640
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:17,361
Food delivery may be slow

641
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:18,041
Delivering a meal

642
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:18,801
Still relatively slow

643
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:19,720
Right

644
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:21,760
Good

645
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
It's okay, thank you

646
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:26,601
This is the ninety-eight

647
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,321
We are number two hundred and thirty-one

648
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:29,680
How long does this have to wait

649
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,841
Just wait a little longer

650
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,760
Haven't you been wanting to eat here for a long time

651
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,121
Normally we don't have time either

652
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,841
All right

653
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
I have a number on my side

654
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:51,401
If you two don't mind

655
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,801
You guys take it and use it

656
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:53,200
Thank you

657
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:53,960
Thank you

658
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,321
It's okay

659
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:54,920
Thank you, thank you

660
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,680
How many numbers

661
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,081
No. 111

662
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,601
Akin

663
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,760
Open up to eat today

664
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,561
I got this one half a month in advance

665
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:01,841
50% discount coupon for the group

666
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,280
Thank you, Lao Zhao

667
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,641
You're polite to me

668
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,121
Come

669
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,960
Even if no one makes an appointment

670
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,520
It's not like celebrating the New Year's Eve alone, right?

671
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,920
Today is after we are together

672
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
First New Year's Eve together

673
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:34,680
Good

674
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,280
That's nice

675
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,401
It seems that I remember

676
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:40,561
Previous New Year's Eve

677
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,041
Are you with Ling Weiyi?

678
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,601
Well

679
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:44,561
How do you know

680
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:47,200
guessed

681
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:49,920
Also

682
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,161
That's too easy to guess

683
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:53,041
In addition to spending the New Year's Eve with her

684
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:53,960
Who else can I follow

685
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,841
But every year

686
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,280
We both have New Year's Eve

687
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,920
Get in the holiday spirit

688
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,081
And nothing else

689
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,680
When we were in college

690
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,680
The lights in the dormitory went out at ten o'clock

691
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,041
Once

692
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,920
We'll be back after twelve o'clock

693
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:07,760
Still

694
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:09,960
Climbing into the dormitory through the window

695
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:11,480
Good thing we're on the second floor

696
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,121
How else do you crawl back

697
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:16,321
What about you

698
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,841
How do you usually spend New Year's Eve

699
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:22,841
I seem to be interested in these New Year's Eve

700
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,081
Not much concept

701
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,680
I remember when I was in college

702
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,760
Every time around New Year's Day

703
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,601
It seems that they are busy working on their papers

704
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,841
Later he went abroad

705
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:35,041
Sharing friends

706
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,041
They will often be at home

707
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,081
Have a house party

708
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,801
But I'm rarely involved

709
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:40,081
Basically it's all myself

710
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,760
It's all alone

711
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:48,200
That

712
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:49,760
I'm kind of your first

713
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,561
It's officially the person to accompany you for the New Year's Eve

714
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:53,801
You guess

715
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,121
Does it seem like I'm quite special

716
00:32:59,401 --> 00:32:59,960
What about me

717
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,121
Now for you

718
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,561
Is there something more special

719
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:10,601
It's almost twelve o'clock

720
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:16,960
Why don't you get up

721
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,081
Come on

722
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Five

723
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,121
Four

724
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,240
Three

725
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:27,440
Two

726
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,041
One

727
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:33,280
Happy New Year

728
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:34,520
Happy New Year

729
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,000
Mr. Ji

730
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,361
Happy New Year

731
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,000
Happy New Year

732
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:41,561
I'm the first

733
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,081
Someone who said Happy New Year to you

734
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,361
I'm also the first

735
00:33:59,361 --> 00:33:59,881
Tu Xiaoning

736
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:01,641
I like you

737
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:04,881
What do you say

738
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,041
I said

739
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:08,680
I like you

740
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,280
What do you say

741
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:13,641
I didn't hear you

742
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,360
I said

743
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:32,280
I like you

744
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,041
I heard this time

745
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:45,961
Happy New Year

746
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:47,400
I wish you a new year

747
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:48,481
Double the bonus

748
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,641
Debt settlement

749
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,601
When did you

750
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,641
Started to like my

751
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:15,680
You want me to

752
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,760
Since when

753
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:20,561
What kind of words do you call

754
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,161
I also want to

755
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:23,521
To make you fall in love with me at first sight

756
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,481
But

757
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,521
It's only four months since love at first sight

758
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:28,720
It didn't take long

759
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,001
Who said that

760
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:33,601
We're not

761
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,921
Have you known each other since high school

762
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,240
Forget it in high school

763
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,240
If you liked me since high school

764
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,001
I have been able to endure it until now

765
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:42,800
Don't confess to me

766
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,240
That's pretty scary, too

767
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,481
When you first told me

768
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:54,760
Aren't you very nervous

769
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:58,800
Is it so obvious

770
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,921
What about when I was in school

771
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,360
No matter how important the exam is

772
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,880
Ji Yuheng, who won't be nervous

773
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,400
At work

774
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,240
No matter what happens

775
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,601
Will be the first time

776
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:14,240
Ji Yuheng who tried to solve it

777
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,240
How could it be

778
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:16,561
Tell me what's wrong

779
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
So nervous

780
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,720
Just do what we just said

781
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,081
You rest first

782
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,360
I don't need it for a while

783
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:46,680
Hiding a ring in a cake

784
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,921
You must not do it

785
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:49,240
What age is this

786
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:50,400
It's too cliche

787
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,961
You tell me

788
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,001
This scenario

789
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,360
Is it too casual

790
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:09,481
I

791
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,280
I want to say

792
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:12,441
What happened to my mother

793
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,121
But don't you forget

794
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:18,280
Ji Yuheng

795
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:19,280
He also has a lot

796
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,121
Something I'm not good at

797
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,280
He will be in front of the people he likes

798
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
at a loss

799
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,760
Will be in the confession

800
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,240
Even if you are ready

801
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,360
A lot of confessions

802
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:30,961
He could only

803
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:32,320
Say I like you

804
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,041
Just one sentence

805
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,200
Actually, I don't know anything

806
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:42,240
Those

807
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:43,601
A glamorous resume

808
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:44,961
Calmness in front of others

809
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,720
It's all after my hard work

810
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,320
Just did it

811
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,081
Actually, on me

812
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,240
There are also many shortcomings

813
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:53,521
I hope

814
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,200
If you see it later

815
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,360
My ordinary

816
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:58,481
Even when it's mediocre

817
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,680
Don't be so disappointed with me

818
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,041
Don't dislike me either

819
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,800
How can I dislike you

820
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,481
You are Ji Yuheng

821
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,481
You like me

822
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,161
I'm Ji Yuheng

823
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:12,320
If you don't like me

824
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,521
I'm just an ordinary person

825
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,081
Ji Yuheng

826
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,720
Always Ji Yuheng

827
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:20,800
In my heart

828
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:22,601
Is the best person in the world

829
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,320
Hello

830
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,161
How's it going

831
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,441
Didn't contact me for two days

832
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,961
In the midst of the dry wood and the raging fire

833
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:02,481
You did so early in the morning

834
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:04,041
Can you say something lighter

835
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,441
How light can the topic of husband and wife be

836
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,561
What nonsense are you talking about

837
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:09,641
boring

838
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:12,280
I haven't had time to tell you

839
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm going to be years ago

840
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,961
Take Qi Yu home

841
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,561
Pull the progress directly to the end

842
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,041
What do you mean

843
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:20,561
Get married next year

844
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,360
So quickly

845
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,441
Very likely

846
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,001
We'll get married together then

847
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,680
Straight into life

848
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,481
Next Stage

849
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,680
You want to marry yours

850
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,400
Why are you still holding me

851
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,200
So anxious

852
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,121
Marry me off

853
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:32,561
Xiao Tu

854
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:33,800
I heard from the guy at the doorman

855
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,360
Achieved results

856
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,561
You check it quickly

857
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,961
I just logged in

858
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:41,961
I passed

859
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:43,720
Ling Weiyi I passed

860
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,081
passed

861
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:45,200
passed

862
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,161
That's great

863
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,720
Everything comes to him who waits

864
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,400
That's great

865
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,001
Okay, Mr. Zheng

866
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,121
When your time is convenient

867
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,360
Let me talk to you face to face

868
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,081
The loan thing

869
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,680
Good

870
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,161
Xiao Tang

871
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:03,481
Got a new customer again

872
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,200
Your speed is too fast

873
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,200
That's amazing, isn't it?

874
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,280
Development Department

875
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:09,200
Performance is king

876
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:10,800
I must have worked hard when I first arrived

877
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,240
Xiao Tang

878
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:13,921
What about this case

879
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,441
Brother, I have to say a few words to you

880
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:16,561
What if

881
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,680
If I were a girl

882
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:18,720
I just choose

883
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:19,720
In the lobby

884
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,001
It's stable

885
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:22,521
Of course

886
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,961
What if you're doing it for Mr. Ji

887
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,360
Then I understand

888
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:28,840
Li Xiangge

889
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:30,320
You don't know too much

890
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,200
We're girls

891
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:32,840
I'm sure I'm too

892
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,800
Want to go up

893
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,521
And in the development department

894
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:37,121
It's also more in line with my career plan

895
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,081
The ascending channel is also smoother

896
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,800
But what else you're going to say

897
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,320
I also have expectations

898
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:46,880
Tu Xiaoning will definitely do it

899
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
Thank you

900
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,800
Sister Xiaoning

901
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,121
Congratulations

902
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:52,360
I didn't expect it to be so soon

903
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,280
Just passed the written test

904
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:55,001
What's unexpected about this

905
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,360
I already guessed Xiao Tu

906
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,720
It will definitely pass in one go

907
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,840
We expand the future of our department

908
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,800
There must be a place for you

909
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:00,680
Thank you, Brother Zhao

910
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:01,320
You're welcome

911
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,680
A long way to go

912
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,121
There's still a lot of hurdles to pass ahead

913
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,041
Xiao Tu ah

914
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:08,280
We can't just have a long way to go

915
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:09,400
Is it right

916
00:42:09,481 --> 00:42:10,720
We have to race against time in the future

917
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,800
What about the quota of labor dispatch to become full-time

918
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:13,720
Very little

919
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,760
You passed the written test

920
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,561
Just basic conditions

921
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,121
But we need sufficient conditions

922
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,601
You have to do it in the shortest possible time

923
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,161
Raise your performance

924
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:20,961
Prove that we

925
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:21,720
Worthy of this spot

926
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:24,601
Talk about it

927
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,720
Isn't it just developing customers

928
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:26,561
That's right

929
00:42:27,521 --> 00:42:28,280
Sister Xiaoning

930
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,680
You need to hold on tighter

931
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,121
From developing customers to lending

932
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:33,081
And one more

933
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,280
A very long process

934
00:42:57,921 --> 00:42:59,081
Everyone, hurry up, hurry up

935
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,161
It's zero o'clock soon

936
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:01,441
Now go to the playground

937
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:02,840
Still in time for the countdown to the New Year

938
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:05,360
Yuheng

939
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,840
Let's go together

940
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:08,521
There are a lot of girls in the school next door

941
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:09,561
Let's all come to celebrate the New Year's Eve together

942
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,001
I won't go

943
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:11,840
You guys go quickly

944
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,481
If you are a master of learning, give it to yourself

945
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:14,400
Take a day off

946
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:14,961
Is it not

947
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,921
Today's size is considered a holiday

948
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:17,441
Yeah, yeah

949
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,240
Brothers, you go first

950
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:21,081
Okay, let's go first

951
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,001
We can't catch up

952
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:23,601
Hurry, hurry, hurry

953
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:52,880
New Year

954
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,800
Who's the first one to tell you

955
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,200
Happy New Year people

956
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:09,161
Happy New Year

957
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:10,121
Tu Xiaoning
