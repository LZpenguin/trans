You Are My Secret EP29

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,959
A large batch of goods

4
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,920
is stuck in inventory.

5
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,879
I'm not able to sell them out.

6
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,640
Also, the cash flow

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,840
has been cut off.

8
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,319
So I couldn't

9
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,200
repay any of the loans.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,959
I couldn't even afford

11
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,679
to expand

12
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
businesses or sales.

13
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,599
I get the picture of the situation

14
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,039
you described.

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,679
This is indeed a significant challenge

16
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,599
for your company.

17
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,519
Mr. Sun,

18
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:14,920
if you still have faith in me,

19
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,000
would it be possible for me to review

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,240
your financial statements?

21
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,759
For this whole thing,

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,160
no one should be blamed.

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,280
I understand that

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,639
not repaying loans

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,039
is not a sustainable solution.

26
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,440
I could only delay it one day

27
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,560
at a time.

28
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,599
So I've rushed to acquire

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,520
this batch of raw materials.

30
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,199
I have an export order

31
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,919
coming up next month.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
If it went through,

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,240
a portion could be repaid.

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,359
To be frank,

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
every time my guys come to see you,

36
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,599
you really don't need to avoid them.

37
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,759
What's the point of meeting them?

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,680
You're just here to pressure me

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,479
to repay the loan

40
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,319
and interest sooner.

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,680
I might as well use this time

42
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:12,440
to go out and hustle

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,759
for some orders.

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,079
Then,

45
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,160
I would repay you a bit more.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,720
And I can also ensure my workers

47
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,840
continue to get paid.

48
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,280
It makes

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
perfect sense.

50
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,879
But there's one thing

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,440
you've got wrong.

52
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,319
We won't

53
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,479
just pressure you for repayment.

54
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,799
We genuinely want to help you

55
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,599
resolve the issues

56
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,919
and get through this obstacle.

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,280
Mr. Sun,

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,000
I actually have a solution.

59
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,759
I'm not sure if you

60
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,079
would be open to try it.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
I can get

62
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,400
another loan for you.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,079
However, it must

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,000
be allocated to

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,479
sales expansion.

66
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,240
Is this possible?

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,720
Although this is

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,919
the first time we've met,

69
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm willing to trust you.

70
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,520
In this challenging situation,

71
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,879
you've managed to keep

72
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,280
financial statements in order.

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,599
That's actually quite rare.

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
And I just noticed

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,919
that in such heavy rain,

76
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,840
you personally led a team of workers

77
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,359
to protect raw materials.

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,160
I believe

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
that you truly care about

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,199
this factory.

81
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
I wanna lend you a hand.

82
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,479
Mr. Ji,

83
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:30,599
if you can

84
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,960
provide us with a loan,

85
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,880
you will be our lifesaver.

86
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,479
As long as we have sufficient cash flow,

87
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,559
we can get back on our feet.

88
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,200
We'll have a way out.

89
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,039
Much appreciate it!

90
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,320
Mr. Sun.

91
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,080
Thank you so much!

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,679
Please don't thank me just yet.

93
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,799
Let me explain first.

94
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Actually, our bank

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,119
isn't giving you a loan

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
as a charity.

97
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,039
Additionally,

98
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,080
we need your facilities

99
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,760
as collateral.

100
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,559
Our interest rate will also increase.

101
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,520
If you can accept

102
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
all these conditions,

103
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,359
then we can proceed

104
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,160
with this.

105
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,039
Sure.

106
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:12,640
I accept them all.

107
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,080
It records all the

108
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
bad debts I've been

109
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,640
handling in Nan'an County.

110
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,479
Among them, the food processing plant

111
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:26,919
has already fully repaid

112
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:27,999
their first installment.

113
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,400
The other 3 companies

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
are gradually repaying their loans.

115
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:36,799
Very impressive.

116
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:38,320
You've really got

117
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,400
the talent.

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,720
You flatter me.

119
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,960
I'm just doing my job.

120
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,720
Honestly, I've got

121
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
great help from two

122
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,280
account managers who were able to

123
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
understand the local situation.

124
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,880
There's something I'm hesitant to say.

125
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,720
I hope the headquarters can pay

126
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,520
more attention to staff like them.

127
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,999
They're dedicated

128
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
on the front lines,

129
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,439
and work diligently.

130
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,679
Their tasks are not easy.

131
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,840
They deserve our support,

132
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:04,999
however,

133
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,599
the higher-ups tend to focus more on you.

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,039
In favorable circumstances,

135
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,999
you can

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,320
follow the trend

137
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,559
and

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,160
create

139
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
achievements.

140
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:15,880
However,

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,280
facing adversity,

142
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,239
it's a different story.

143
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,320
Nan'an has

144
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,439
a great number of bad debts.

145
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,919
It's challenging to conduct business.

146
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,599
These days,

147
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,640
you've been devoted

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,679
to the work without any complaints.

149
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:28,599
Moreover,

150
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,520
you've resolved

151
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,320
the

152
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
long-standing bad debts

153
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,479
properly.

154
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,640
It's no exaggeration to say

155
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,080
that the results you've achieved

156
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,080
are more impressive

157
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,919
than what you've done in S1.

158
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,479
Thank you, sir.

159
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,400
Back when you're in S1,

160
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,320
your president

161
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,320
always praised you.

162
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:47,439
I thought

163
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,280
he's exaggerating.

164
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:50,840
Looking back now,

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
he's got a solid point.

166
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,799
When you reach

167
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,280
a higher position,

168
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,559
I hope you can stick

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,840
to your principles.

170
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,200
Do your best

171
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,479
in your work.

172
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,039
I will definitely not

173
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:04,840
let you down, sir.

174
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:22,799
What brings you here?

175
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,359
I've got good news that

176
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,720
I wanted to share with you right away.

177
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:30,760
I've been reassigned back.

178
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,919
Really?

179
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,479
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

180
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,160
These past six months,

181
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,679
you've been running around.

182
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
How hard you work!

183
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,919
Thank you so much these days.

184
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,439
Good thing I'm back now.

185
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,720
So, which branch

186
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,760
have you been assigned to?

187
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,039
Ji'an branch.

188
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,999
The transfer order's already been issued.

189
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,720
I'll be serving as the branch president.

190
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
I'll report in tomorrow.

191
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,720
So should I call you

192
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,520
President Ji from now on?

193
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
That's perfectly fine.

194
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,080
Wonderful.

195
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,960
Different paths led to the same goal.

196
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,400
You've achieved what you wanted.

197
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,280
Congrats.

198
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,119
This is good for both of us.

199
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,400
Right.

200
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,760
That's so good!

201
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,640
By the way,

202
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,679
are you planning to take a vacation?

203
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,319
I do plan to take one.

204
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,079
What?

205
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,679
Are you thinking of taking a vacation?

206
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,520
I was thinking

207
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,600
we can take a vacation

208
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,559
together.

209
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,280
Then,

210
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,880
we could go on a trip.

211
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,880
It might not be possible recently.

212
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,039
Jing is going on maternity leave.

213
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,520
Before that,

214
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,400
she definitely wants to

215
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,079
achieve something.

216
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,760
She's under great pressure.

217
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,199
It wouldn't be appropriate

218
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:07,480
for me to leave her now.

219
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,760
That makes sense.

220
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,439
Actually,

221
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:13,000
this is your fault.

222
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,079
You've set the standards for S1

223
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:16,000
too high.

224
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,199
I remember you mentioned vacation

225
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,360
a few months ago.

226
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,199
Do you have any plans?

227
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,039
No something special.

228
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,719
Now that you're at Ji'an branch,

229
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,319
has your workload increased?

230
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,400
Is it hard to spare some time now?

231
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,039
In any case, if you

232
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,280
have that plan,

233
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:39,679
let me know.

234
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,719
We can coordinate our schedules.

235
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,880
I can adjust to your timing.

236
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,199
Sounds good!

237
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,000
I just happened to overhear it

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,079
at the front desk.

239
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,079
The headquarters

240
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,439
sent someone to try out the position.

241
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,079
But after the trial,

242
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,280
they found that Ji Yuheng

243
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,079
is the most capable.

244
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,799
Finally, the position of president

245
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,880
went to him.

246
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,160
His abilities are certainly commendable.

247
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,679
He got reassigned back to the city,

248
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,120
so he doesn't have to travel every day.

249
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,799
Xiaoning must be relieved.

250
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:13,280
Yes.

251
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,919
You just mentioned

252
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,039
Ji'an branch.

253
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,559
I happen to be looking at

254
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,319
houses nearby.

255
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,319
After, I'll consult him

256
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,919
about home loan options.

257
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,760
That's a good idea.

258
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,039
That area is now

259
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,000
under his management anyway.

260
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,799
He'll definitely be able to tell you

261
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,520
what the best deal is.

262
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,799
That's true.

263
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,360
No. 6, please.

264
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,719
Here.

265
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,799
I didn't expect to find my favorite

266
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,199
milk tea at your workplace.

267
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,400
There's even a nail salon nearby.

268
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,520
Really?

269
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,520
Dad.

270
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,280
Mom.

271
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,600
Yu.

272
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,360
You've lost weight.

273
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,280
Is the work too hard for you?

274
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,280
By the way,

275
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,880
your dad has been approved for retirement.

276
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,600
We're thinking

277
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,079
of renting a place nearby

278
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,039
to spend more time with you.

279
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,480
We can also

280
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,039
explore and have fun here.

281
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,120
What's fun

282
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,760
around here?

283
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,640
Why are you so chatty today?

284
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,480
Weiyi,

285
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,319
we've been waiting

286
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,199
for almost half an hour.

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,799
Do you know

288
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,280
when your dad will arrive?

289
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,959
I...

290
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,240
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,880
He has a full schedule.

292
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,959
He's still in a meeting right now.

293
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,079
Today,

294
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,600
he probably won't make it.

295
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,360
It's OK.

296
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,360
We came

297
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,199
on such short notice.

298
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,000
It's not like that.

299
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,880
Your coming

300
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,280
makes Qi Yu and me very happy.

301
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,559
My dad feels really embarrassed.

302
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,919
He arranged a family suite for you

303
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,480
at the hotel he owns.

304
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,600
You can stay there

305
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,799
for the next few days.

306
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,520
It's very convenient.

307
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,079
No need for that.

308
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,400
We've already

309
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,240
booked a place.

310
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,240
Right.

311
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,360
Qi Yu!

312
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,799
Dad.

313
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,520
Mom.

314
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,280
We've been working all day,

315
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,199
and we haven't had dinner.

316
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
You must be hungry from your trip too.

317
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,719
How about we eat something?

318
00:12:59,439 --> 00:12:59,959
Excuse me!

319
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,640
Please.

320
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,760
There's no need to order so much.

321
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,280
We're just common folks.

322
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,839
Home-cooked meals are okay

323
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,799
for us.

324
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,000
It's not easy to make money.

325
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,880
Ordering so much...

326
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,079
Isn't that just

327
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:39,520
going to

328
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
cost a fortune?

329
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,120
Ma'am,

330
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,520
please make yourself at home.

331
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,919
This is one of the best

332
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,079
restaurants in the area.

333
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,799
Since you both don't come around often,

334
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,120
we should treat you to a good one.

335
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:49,839
Sir,

336
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,880
Qi Yu told me you love seafood.

337
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,120
This king crab

338
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,719
is particularly fresh and renowned.

339
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,199
It's imported from Northern Europe.

340
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,039
Please

341
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,000
have a try.

342
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,199
Dad.

343
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,199
What business does Weiyi's family run?

344
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,280
I think it's in

345
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,160
real estate and investment.

346
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,240
What's up, dad?

347
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,919
You mentioned today

348
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,280
that the building she works in

349
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,360
belongs to her family.

350
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,079
According to what she said,

351
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,600
the hotel is theirs as well?

352
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:57,839
Yes.

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,640
How embarrassing!

354
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,919
You've completely embarrassed

355
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,919
our family, you know?

356
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,799
Calm down.

357
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,039
Don't get mad.

358
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,160
He should thank me for not kicking his ass!

359
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,319
Let me ask you,

360
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,559
are you a good match?

361
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,000
Is it going to work out?

362
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,480
Do you know

363
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,160
what this is called?

364
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,439
You wanna marry into her family?

365
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,839
To put it bluntly,

366
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,679
it's called freeloading!

367
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,959
Don't talk nonsense.

368
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,240
What?

369
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,880
When your son marries her one day,

370
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,919
and moves in

371
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,679
with her family,

372
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,400
you know what your relatives will say?

373
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,719
It will be much worse than I did!

374
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,520
You know?

375
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,120
Dad,

376
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,079
I'm with Ling Weiyi

377
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,319
because we like each other.

378
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,360
We're in a serious relationship.

379
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
Let others say

380
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,959
what they want.

381
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,240
C'mon!

382
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,520
Her dad didn't even show up at dinner.

383
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,760
A serious relationship?

384
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,360
Does her whole family even respect you?

385
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,719
Besides,

386
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,600
a dinner costing grands,

387
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,679
is this how you live seriously?

388
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,400
Are you serious?

389
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,160
Alright, alright.

390
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,240
Qi Yu,

391
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,600
actually, your dad and I

392
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,000
don't hate Weiyi at all.

393
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,719
This is our first time meeting her.

394
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:00,919
We can feel

395
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,520
her sincerity.

396
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,319
But the gap between our families

397
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,360
is really too big.

398
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,719
If you get married,

399
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,360
it's only a matter of time...

400
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,919
Alright,

401
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,000
enough talk.

402
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,880
Just break up with her.

403
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,360
Did you hear me?

404
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,439
Dad!

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,160
We're actually saving money.

406
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,640
We wanna make a decent living as well.

407
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,839
About the dinner,

408
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,400
we spent that much 'cause

409
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,079
this is your first visit.

410
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,000
We wanted to treat you to something nice.

411
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,559
So you could have a good time.

412
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,360
Was that wrong?

413
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,559
Please leave us alone.

414
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,839
I'm begging you.

415
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,360
Please!

416
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,039
You...

417
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,160
Alright, alright.

418
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,000
I...

419
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,959
Calm down!

420
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,000
What a good son he is!

421
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,039
Keep calm!

422
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,880
Don't be upset.

423
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,919
Let's talk it out.

424
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,480
Good morning, Mr. Ji!

425
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,039
Morning!

426
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,559
Good morning, sir!

427
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,240
Morning!

428
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,199
Good morning, President!

429
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,400
Good morning, President!

430
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,520
Good morning, sir.

431
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,360
Busy, huh?

432
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,600
Good morning, sir.

433
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,400
Boss!

434
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,120
Morning!

435
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,640
Come on, Mr. Zhao.

436
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,600
Take a look.

437
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
This office is much bigger

438
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,199
than the previous one.

439
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,400
After all, you're the branch president.

440
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,479
Your status

441
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
is different now.

442
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,199
Here.

443
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:36,479
I've taken this position indeed,

444
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,120
but to stay secure in it,

445
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,040
I'll need to show some results later.

446
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:41,560
Come on,

447
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,959
you've already brought me onboard.

448
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,880
With us working together,

449
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,800
we'll definitely

450
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,040
be unstoppable.

451
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,160
About this position,

452
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,800
since you've already taken it,

453
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll help you secure it

454
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,160
and stay here forever.

455
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,999
I'm very reassured that you're here.

456
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,160
However, you are aware

457
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,199
of the situation here.

458
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,439
The sales sector

459
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,759
is still the key focus

460
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,560
of our future work.

461
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,199
We need to compete for clients with

462
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,239
all the established banks in the city,

463
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,239
including other branches of Dairui.

464
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
So in the coming month,

465
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,560
I hope that while we're exploring

466
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,919
smaller clients,

467
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,840
we can also secure one or two groups

468
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,360
of major ones with a volume

469
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,919
of over 50 million.

470
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,199
That's when we can truly

471
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,279
build our beachhead.

472
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,199
No problem.

473
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,040
I studied it all night last night,

474
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,400
and I found

475
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,320
a client...

476
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,759
Come in.

477
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,080
Jing,

478
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
I heard you just vomited.

479
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,199
I'm alright, really.

480
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,560
Oh my!

481
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,199
This pregnancy

482
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,439
has really worn me out.

483
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,679
How's going with you?

484
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,519
Is the project going well?

485
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,120
I need to tell you something important.

486
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,959
I recently got in touch with a

487
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,560
long-established private enterprise.

488
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,360
Currently,

489
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:54,279
the presidency has been passed to

490
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,679
the grandson who just

491
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,640
returned from abroad.

492
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,160
Is it Mr. Fu

493
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,840
you mentioned earlier?

494
00:18:58,999 --> 00:18:59,360
Yes.

495
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,439
Mr. Fu.

496
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:01,239
Under his leadership,

497
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,279
he's eager

498
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,439
to expand the company.

499
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,519
So he needs

500
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,560
huge financial support.

501
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,360
If we can establish

502
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,640
a partnership with him.

503
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,640
Jing,

504
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,439
you'll solidify your position

505
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,600
as the manager.

506
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,400
Which company is it?

507
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,800
Youpin Tea.

508
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,800
For a company of this scale,

509
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,519
I'm sure no one

510
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,919
would want to miss out.

511
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:24,840
Absolutely.

512
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,439
I can say that

513
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,040
all our competitors

514
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,519
in this city

515
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,080
are getting ready for action.

516
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,959
Other banks certainly don't want to

517
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,320
miss out on such a valuable client.

518
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,999
We need to take the initiative.

519
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,080
We're still in the contact stage.

520
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,840
Before we secure the deal,

521
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,080
we must remain vigilant about

522
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,040
what we should say or shouldn't.

523
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,519
I believe you're

524
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,439
well aware of this.

525
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,519
This is a

526
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,919
highly competitive info warfare.

527
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:45,880
Therefore, our actions

528
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,679
and proposals

529
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,919
must remain confidential.

530
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,880
The more sensitive the info,

531
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,239
the more we need to prevent leaks.

532
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,759
We should mislead the competition.

533
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,160
Right.

534
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,400
This campaign for Ji'an branch

535
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,120
is not just your

536
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,360
battle for recognition,

537
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,800
but also mine.

538
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:03,800
Not to mention the competitors,

539
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
even at home,

540
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,320
I promise I won't let slip

541
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,120
a single word.

542
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,719
Floral aroma and sweet aftertaste.

543
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:21,959
Nice.

544
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,919
Honey-scented lily.

545
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,759
No wonder it's the top seller.

546
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:34,999
What?

547
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,360
Is there something hidden in there?

548
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,199
A love letter from another girl?

549
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,800
Of course not.

550
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,320
Aside from your love letters,

551
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,719
I won't accept anything from anyone else.

552
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,880
Mr. Ji,

553
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,279
we're separated

554
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,239
not long ago.

555
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,400
Do you have to be so wary of me?

556
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,919
You weren't like this before.

557
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,880
This really hurts my feelings.

558
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,120
Tell me,

559
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,759
how much do you need to hit your target?

560
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,719
If you're short on clients,

561
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:02,600
I have some extra ones

562
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,320
I can share.

563
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
I want the biggest one!

564
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,279
You and Rao Jing,

565
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,439
you both have quite the appetite now.

566
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,560
Obviously, I'll go for the biggest.

567
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,719
What are you drinking?

568
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,719
Something for beauty and skincare.

569
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,519
Men should stay out of women's affairs.

570
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,239
Mr. Zhou,

571
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,919
this is Mr. Chen, our VP.

572
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,719
He is

573
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,759
the supervisor

574
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,519
in charge of loans for

575
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,919
medium and large enterprises.

576
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,320
Yesterday, he heard

577
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,719
that Youpin is applying for a loan.

578
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,919
He canceled many

579
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,880
important client meetings,

580
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,120
insisting on coming today

581
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
to visit Youpin.

582
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,239
Thank you

583
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,239
so much, Mr. Chen.

584
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:41,959
And also,

585
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,080
thank you, Ms. Rao.

586
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,439
I heard that Youpin's headquarters

587
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,679
has been allocated to Ji'an.

588
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,360
This is actually my first visit here.

589
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,560
For enterprises

590
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,959
with proven quality

591
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
and strength,

592
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,800
the government must provide

593
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:57,880
the most favorable support.

594
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,160
We really appreciate it.

595
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,479
Our president, Mr. Fu

596
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,719
is eager to drive innovation.

597
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,560
In this regard,

598
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,840
your backing will be essential.

599
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:05,959
Good.

600
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:06,840
I'll head over right away.

601
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,320
Mr. Zhou,

602
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,479
before we came here,

603
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,959
we contacted your accounting dept.

604
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,040
Xiaoning and I

605
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,880
would like to take a look at

606
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,719
your financial statements.

607
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,840
So please

608
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,360
bring Mr Chen over first.

609
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,919
- Sure. - Thanks.

610
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,360
No problem.

611
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:17,959
Mr Chen,

612
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,719
please go ahead.

613
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:19,279
- Okay. - This way.

614
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,080
- We'll see you in a bit. - Sure.

615
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,919
At Dairui, we always uphold

616
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,199
the principle of growing

617
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,160
and progressing alongside our partners.

618
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,080
Our collaboration with Youpin

619
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,279
will surely be top-notch.

620
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:30,120
Great.

621
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,360
Thank you so much.

622
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,239
Let me

623
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,080
show you around

624
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,719
over there.

625
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,320
Sure.

626
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,360
Jing, you wouldn't believe it,

627
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:38,959
ever since

628
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,679
my husband

629
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,919
stopped working with me,

630
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,439
he's been trying every trick

631
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,600
to get information from me.

632
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,479
Really?

633
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,400
I should have chosen

634
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,719
a different profession to marry into.

635
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,199
Let me tell you,

636
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,519
it might be too late

637
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,080
to change professions.

638
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,479
How about changing husbands?

639
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:53,800
That's still an option.

640
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,840
No, I'm not willing to do that.

641
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,080
I'm telling you,

642
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,040
my husband is different.

643
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,880
He can't keep his mouth shut.

644
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,040
Do you know what he's dreaming

645
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,840
about last night?

646
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,840
He's talking about pig feed.

647
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,840
I asked him

648
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:07,840
what kind

649
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,080
of pig feed it was,

650
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,679
In his dream,

651
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,719
he told me that

652
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,040
they just finished working

653
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,679
with a pig feed client.

654
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,360
Then he explained

655
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,279
all what they're doing,

656
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,959
like discounting, factoring,

657
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:20,919
and small business loans.

658
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:21,479
You know, everything

659
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:22,479
our bank does.

660
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,439
He covered every detail,

661
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:25,239
and even wanted me

662
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,360
to join in.

663
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,519
At least he's open.

664
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,600
Mr. Ji doesn't quite measure up.

665
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,239
Open?

666
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,600
He's got no subtlety at all.

667
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,320
Oh, right, I wanna tell you

668
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,199
that when I was coming over,

669
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
I noticed they're dealing with tea,

670
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,479
but they've also

671
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,239
brought in

672
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:44,040
a lot of coffee sets

673
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,719
and beans from abroad.

674
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm thinking

675
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,040
maybe they're planning

676
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,719
to branch into the coffee business?

677
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:49,560
Actually,

678
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,800
I asked Mr Zhou

679
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,320
the same question just now.

680
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,679
He told me

681
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,880
that it's simply because

682
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,600
his boss loves coffee.

683
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,320
So he's collected

684
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,199
coffee-related items

685
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,239
from around the world.

686
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,320
I thought they're expanding into coffee

687
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,719
and might need more loans.

688
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,800
Judging by the new equipment,

689
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,040
they're probably launching

690
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,679
some new products.

691
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,160
Impressive.

692
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,120
The intel we gathered

693
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,999
and what you picked up

694
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,040
seem spot-on.

695
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,800
Well,

696
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,640
not even calling me boss anymore?

697
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,199
Boss.

698
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,519
Mr. Fu is doing well,

699
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,360
expanding production lines

700
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,040
and scaling up operations.

701
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,759
I imagine

702
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,519
his future loan needs

703
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,239
will be substantial.

704
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,800
That's no small potatoes

705
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,279
like your pig feed.

706
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,560
So, no more sleep-talking

707
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,800
about business deals.

708
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,719
What do you know?

709
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,320
That's all part of my strategy,

710
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,959
mixing truth

711
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,800
with fiction.

712
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,120
You overseas returnees all

713
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,040
seem to go against the grain, huh?

714
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,439
You usually don't follow

715
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,199
your family's business.

716
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,959
Sounds like

717
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,679
the client you visited today

718
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,880
is also someone who studied abroad.

719
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,199
I'm talking life,

720
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,479
and you're talking clients,

721
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:09,560
seriously?

722
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:12,999
"Also"?

723
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,239
Does that mean

724
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,999
your client today

725
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:17,919
is a returnee too?

726
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,199
Young,

727
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,919
ambitious,

728
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,759
and has a strong vision

729
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,519
for business growth

730
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,759
and development.

731
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:32,959
You're saying

732
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,679
that he's taken over the family business.

733
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:35,880
How big is it?

734
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,919
Is it so large that you can't

735
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,679
reveal a single detail?

736
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,120
One deal

737
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,160
worth a year's revenue?

738
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,040
That's a trade secret.

739
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:54,880
Stingy.

740
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:01,999
Mr. Fu seems

741
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:03,840
to have a wide range of hobbies.

742
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,080
A second-generation tea heir

743
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,999
who's really into coffee, huh?

744
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,759
Jing, did you notice

745
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,040
the shelves in his office?

746
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
They're filled

747
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,160
with various brochures of

748
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,600
fast-moving consumer goods.

749
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,880
Yes, I did.

750
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,279
I also noticed

751
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,999
a couple of books on the table about

752
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:22,919
the rise of coffee brands.

753
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,080
Do you think his next move

754
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,759
might be to develop

755
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,999
a fast-moving tea drink,

756
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,279
similar to coffee?

757
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,679
If the company

758
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,560
is heading in that direction,

759
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,360
it should have been clearly outlined

760
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
in their loan proposal

761
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
to our bank.

762
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
But it wasn't.

763
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,199
And when we visited yesterday,

764
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,120
Mr Zhou didn't mention anything.

765
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,560
There might be some internal

766
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,600
conflicts within his family.

767
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:49,600
Maybe that's why

768
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,800
it's not convenient for

769
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,800
to disclose something?

770
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
If our assumptions

771
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,519
are correct,

772
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,759
their loan amount

773
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,800
should be

774
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,199
much higher.

775
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:01,800
Here.

776
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,519
Take a look at this.

777
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,199
I had our guy check it out,

778
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,400
the latest equipment

779
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,600
on their production line

780
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,320
is for a quick-brew tea brand.

781
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:09,959
So, they're aiming to enter

782
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,519
the fast-moving beverage market.

783
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:15,400
That fits.

784
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,239
I called

785
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,080
their VP yesterday,

786
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,320
and they're planning to open stores.

787
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,519
I think they want to create something

788
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,279
like a chain of tea shops,

789
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,080
similar to bubble tea stores,

790
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,320
targeting

791
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,479
the youth market.

792
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,279
What's your estimate

793
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,400
for their

794
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,959
loan requirement?

795
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,040
50 million?

796
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,400
Based on their investment plan

797
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,600
and assessment report...

798
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:41,479
Around 100 million.

799
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:01,800
Tired?

800
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,600
What are you doing here?

801
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,959
Waiting for you.

802
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,160
Want to take a walk?

803
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:07,320
Sure.

804
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:17,679
How was work?

805
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,400
Exhausting?

806
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,800
Not bad.

807
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,959
But you look a bit worn out,

808
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,080
Mr Ji.

809
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,040
What's up?

810
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,320
Trouble

811
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,640
with the client?

812
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,880
We've been working on

813
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,679
several financing plans

814
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,439
to meet the client's expected costs,

815
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,880
but we can't get the interest rate down.

816
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,719
What's the lowest rate

817
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,519
your branch

818
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,560
can offer right now?

819
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,999
What?

820
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,479
Well...

821
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,560
C'mon,

822
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,239
you're really something.

823
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,999
First, you wait under the streetlight,

824
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,679
then you play the sympathy card,

825
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,320
and now you're trying to charm me.

826
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,400
You're mixing business with pleasure.

827
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:02,759
So,

828
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,199
is it working?

829
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,880
Well, since the deal

830
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,040
is almost closed,

831
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,239
I guess I can share.

832
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,880
5-year rate,

834
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,840
5-year rate at 4.8%?

835
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,759
Using the factory as collateral?

836
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,239
Plus a piece of real estate.

837
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,759
And the final loan amount?

838
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,279
100 million.

839
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:25,880
No,

840
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,360
around 70 to 80 million.

841
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,360
70 to 80 million?

842
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:31,360
Really?

843
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,959
Sounds like a

844
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,479
100-million client.

845
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,160
I might have

846
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,400
exaggerated a bit.

847
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,600
Factory as collateral

848
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,840
plus additional real estate,

849
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,679
can the client accept that?

850
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:47,999
And can you afford

851
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:49,040
to offer such a low rate?

852
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,199
No answer?

853
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:55,919
I guess I won't get

854
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,080
the truth out of you.

855
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,080
I should head back.

856
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,120
Got some work to do.

857
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,199
Leaving already?

858
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,400
Not going to use your charm anymore?

859
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,560
Busy with work,

860
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,800
and still keeping secrets.

861
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,040
He's avoiding proposing to me.

862
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,479
Seriously?

863
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,040
A privacy screen protector?

864
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,080
Special times

865
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:29,999
call for special measures.

866
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,479
This is just too much.

867
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,279
I'm so clumsy.

868
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,880
Just my luck,

869
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,239
running into the same client.

870
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,679
Did you see anything?

871
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,160
What do you mean?

872
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,840
What could I have seen?

873
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,120
I saw nothing.

874
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,479
You're covering it

875
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,640
all up so well.

876
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,360
I could uncover a lot.

877
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,519
Come on.

878
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,199
What are you doing?

879
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,519
Since my brother-in-law left,

880
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,919
how many finance staff have resigned?

881
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:33,840
None of the old ones

882
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,439
are left.

883
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:37,679
Mr. Fu,

884
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,719
your idea about

885
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:40,600
fast-moving consumer goods

886
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,519
is solid,

887
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,679
but it requires

888
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:44,080
substantial financial backing.

889
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:45,519
The finance team

890
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,679
leaving now

891
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,999
is clearly

892
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,919
a deliberate obstacle.

893
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,160
How's the loan negotiation going?

894
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,479
Over the past few days,

895
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,439
we've received

896
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,600
many proposals from banks,

897
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,600
and you've personally met

898
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,160
some key figures.

899
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,199
For now,

900
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,919
Mr Zhou and I think

901
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,719
that two of them stand out.

902
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:09,479
Yes.

903
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:10,479
One offers

904
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,600
a credit line

905
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,959
with better

906
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,160
cost-effectiveness,

907
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,199
while the other

908
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,040
offers

909
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,360
a longer loan term

910
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,800
with a repayment schedule

911
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,279
more suited to our needs.

912
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:22,080
Here.

913
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,320
Ji'an...

914
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,840
Xing City...

915
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:34,640
Here,

916
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,400
take a look.

917
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,040
This place is almost ready.

918
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,640
It's not huge,

919
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,199
but both bedrooms face the sun.

920
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,759
Look.

921
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
And the transportation is good,

922
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,120
right by the expressway.

923
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,040
Looks good.

924
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:49,040
Let's buy it.

925
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,199
And your parents can live here.

926
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,239
Weiyi,

927
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,120
I was thinking

928
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,840
this could be where we live

929
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,919
after we get married.

930
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,279
It'll be our home.

931
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,759
We'll live at my place

932
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,759
in the city center.

933
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,279
It's close to both our jobs,

934
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:05,919
so why move further away?

935
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
But isn't that

936
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,040
your dad's house?

937
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,719
I wanted us to have something...

938
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,239
That could be

939
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,320
ours.

940
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:13,959
You just need

941
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,360
to move in.

942
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,840
This place

943
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,400
is small and cramped.

944
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,439
It'll be uncomfortable,

945
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
especially

946
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,640
if we

947
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,919
have kids later.

948
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,120
Right.

949
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:32,600
Qi Yu,

950
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,999
we can save money

951
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:35,360
on daily consumption,

952
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,360
but comfort

953
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,519
is the top priority for houses.

954
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,479
After all,

955
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,800
we have to live inside every day.

956
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:46,519
Weiyi,

957
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,640
how about

958
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
you move in

959
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,320
after it's bought?

960
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,759
If you don't think

961
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,040
it's good for you,

962
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,600
we can...

963
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,320
It won't work for me.

964
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,160
I don't understand

965
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,040
why you're so stubborn

966
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,600
about this.

967
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,600
We're happy together,

968
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,319
aren't we?

969
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:18,839
We've solved

970
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,920
the long-distance issue,

971
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,839
but now

972
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,719
our relationship

973
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,879
feels heavier.

974
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,080
But actually,

975
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,279
it's not a big thing at all.

976
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,520
I have a house.

977
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:34,679
We could

978
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,199
live well...

979
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,399
But it's not my house,

980
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,239
and I can't afford that lifestyle.

981
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm okay with splurging on meals.

982
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,080
My parents say

983
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,960
our spending is too high,

984
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,319
but I hold it in.

985
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:41,799
It's fine.

986
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,199
But taking advantage of your house

987
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,080
makes me feel...

988
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,879
less of a man.

989
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
I can't respect myself like that,

990
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,600
you know?

991
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:47,640
Your parents said something?

992
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,199
About me?

993
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,279
About my spending habits?

994
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:52,080
- Did they? - No.

995
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,799
Just that our families

996
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,040
have different spending habits,

997
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,560
you know?

998
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:55,279
So they

999
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,799
don't approve of me?

1000
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,199
I tried so hard to impress them,

1001
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,160
even used

1002
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,239
my credit card.

1003
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,399
But now it's my fault?

1004
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,000
Qi Yu, do you know

1005
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,879
how I've been living lately?

1006
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,000
I have money but can't spend it,

1007
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,640
I'm miserable!

1008
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,719
Weiyi, I know you're frustrated.

1009
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,199
I know my situation

1010
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,560
isn't great right now,

1011
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,199
and this house

1012
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,199
is all I can offer.

1013
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,160
But I wanna

1014
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,960
work hard

1015
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,679
for our future.

1016
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,199
You believe me?

1017
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,600
Don't say you're doing this for me.

1018
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,160
Really, you're

1019
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,560
just planning

1020
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,160
within your limits

1021
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,480
for your own future.

1022
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:30,399
For our future,

1023
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,440
I'd have to

1024
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,839
give up

1025
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,279
living in my big house,

1026
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,799
and spending my money,

1027
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:36,560
or else I'd make you

1028
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,920
feel bad about yourself.

1029
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:42,759
So basically,

1030
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:43,359
you just want me

1031
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,719
to live by your standards.

1032
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,239
That's not what I mean.

1033
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,679
Then what do you mean?

1034
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,279
Qi Yu,

1035
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,520
isn't that selfish of you?

1036
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,799
We used to be so good together.

1037
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,839
We watched sunsets.

1038
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,120
He took me to see fish...

1039
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,799
We've done the most

1040
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:27,239
romantic things together.

1041
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,199
So why does

1042
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,080
everything now have to be

1043
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:32,879
about money and houses,

1044
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,399
making us so unhappy?

1045
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,560
Why?

1046
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,480
Okay, okay,

1047
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:41,520
stop crying.

1048
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,319
You're embarrassing yourself.

1049
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,679
Do you know how long

1050
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,399
it's been since I ate like this?

1051
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,120
All I think about

1052
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,679
is saving money

1053
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,080
and planning our life.

1054
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,960
But what's the point?

1055
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,440
My dad doesn't approve,

1056
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,279
his parents are against it.

1057
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,920
What's the point

1058
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,600
of doing this?

1059
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,799
Just do it

1060
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:02,719
if you wanna cry.

1061
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,160
Maybe

1062
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,359
you'll feel better after.

1063
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,359
Want me to call Qi Yu?

1064
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,120
No!

1065
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,080
I don't wanna see him.

1066
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,399
Just thinking about him

1067
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,560
talking about all this again

1068
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,239
makes me sick!

1069
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,199
You know

1070
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,199
what he said today?

1071
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:22,719
He told me

1072
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,279
that he'd feel uncomfortable

1073
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,319
living in my house,

1074
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:27,560
like he'd lose respect for himself.

1075
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:29,279
But I'm supposed

1076
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,960
to lower my standard of living

1077
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,799
for his self-esteem?

1078
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,520
He's not even

1079
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,560
considering me.

1080
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,359
Is that so?

1081
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:39,759
To be honest,

1082
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,759
if he wasn't

1083
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,719
considering you,

1084
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,120
he wouldn't be doing all this.

1085
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,399
Buying a house is his way

1086
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,199
to show that he wanna marry you.

1087
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,560
He's not wrong,

1088
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:49,440
but...

1089
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,960
So I'm wrong?

1090
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,920
You're not.

1091
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,960
Definitely.

1092
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,759
I just

1093
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,679
don't want

1094
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,160
that kind of life.

1095
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,719
Look,

1096
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,480
I have everything I need,

1097
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,000
like a big house,

1098
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,759
and plenty of money.

1099
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,000
Why should I sacrifice

1100
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and struggle

1101
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,600
just to make him feel better?

1102
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,600
I don't

1103
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,759
understand this!

1104
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:22,839
Waiter!

1105
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:26,040
Bring us two more bottles,

1106
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:27,199
the best ones.

1107
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:32,920
C'mon,

1108
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,480
stop drinking alone.

1109
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,279
I'll join you.

1110
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:38,799
I feel like

1111
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,440
such an idiot

1112
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:42,359
for denying myself

1113
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,160
for his sake.

1114
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,679
From now on,

1115
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,239
I'm going to be

1116
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,120
true to myself.

1117
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:50,399
As long as you're happy.

1118
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,440
The last time we broke up,

1119
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:00,960
I thought the problem

1120
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,160
was the long distance.

1121
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,560
I believe that

1122
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,839
once this is resolved, it will be fine.

1123
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,279
But now I realize

1124
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,719
that sustaining a long-term relationship

1125
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,199
isn't just about romance.

1126
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,480
It's based on reality too,

1127
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:14,759
right?

1128
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,040
Like a stable

1129
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,399
and decent job,

1130
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,160
a house, a car,

1131
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,319
and a solid foundation...

1132
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,520
Especially when it comes to

1133
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,160
marriage.

1134
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,560
I was happy about it,

1135
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,239
but now

1136
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,319
I just feel anxious,

1137
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:34,879
and stressed.

1138
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,799
You know what I mean?

1139
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,480
I wanna secure

1140
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,440
all these early,

1141
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,160
making preparations

1142
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:42,839
for a stable future.

1143
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,120
But Weiyi doesn't need that.

1144
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,759
She's got everything.

1145
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,799
Honestly,

1146
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:51,879
she doesn't need

1147
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,080
to worry about

1148
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
the practicalities

1149
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,239
like saving money

1150
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,120
or living frugally.

1151
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,520
She did all to match my pace.

1152
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,440
But why should she have to

1153
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,399
compromise herself

1154
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,199
for me?

1155
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:14,440
In the end,

1156
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,080
Weiyi is unhappy,

1157
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,600
and so are

1158
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,239
my parents.

1159
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,960
And her dad wasn't impressed with me.

1160
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,399
I work hard

1161
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,839
every day,

1162
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,759
trying to improve myself,

1163
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,440
but what for?

1164
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,199
Am I wrong here?

1165
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,160
Have you talked about

1166
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,839
this with Weiyi?

1167
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,160
Probably not, right?

1168
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,600
I think

1169
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,719
you need to communicate.

1170
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,279
Without talking it out,

1171
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,199
you'll never find a solution.

1172
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,040
A solution?

1173
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,520
What solution?

1174
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:57,719
There isn't one.

1175
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,440
I can't become

1176
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,319
wealthy overnight,

1177
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,560
or expect her to lower her standards.

1178
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,799
What's that phrase again?

1179
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,520
Downward compatibility,

1180
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,040
right?

1181
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:08,399
Honestly,

1182
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,480
sometimes parents' worries

1183
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,359
aren't baseless.

1184
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,520
They have a point.

1185
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:15,879
Neither of us is wrong.

1186
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,920
We're just...

1187
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,920
Here.

1188
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,679
It's been so long,

1189
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,279
and there's still no sign from him.

1190
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,759
Does he think that just 'cause

1191
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,960
things have already gone this far,

1192
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,879
he doesn't need to propose?

1193
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,759
Dinner's ready.

1194
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:51,799
What are you looking for?

1195
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,520
My notebook.

1196
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,440
I like to review it often.

1197
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,520
It helps me stay on track.

1198
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,879
That's good.

1199
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:02,359
Always refreshing your knowledge.

1200
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:06,319
Experience might

1201
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,040
let you

1202
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,080
coast on clever tricks

1203
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,000
after a while.

1204
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
But

1205
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,920
there are key steps

1206
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,440
and moments

1207
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,080
that you just can't skip.

1208
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:18,920
Right,

1209
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,560
Mr Ji?

1210
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,480
Absolutely.

1211
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,120
Why the sudden talk?

1212
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,399
Let's eat.

1213
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,080
Alright.
