[You Are My Secret]
[EP12]

3
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:07,800
Morning,

4
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,599
boss.

5
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,479
[Finished your report already]

6
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,440
[and have nothing to do?]

7
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,840
I do have work.

8
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,399
Watching funny videos in the morning

9
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,360
helps me

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,959
stay energized all day.

11
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Seems like

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,920
you're not busy enough.

13
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,520
I heard you

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,240
play matchmaker

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
for your colleagues.

16
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,720
How about this,

17
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,319
you help with the high-tech certification

18
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,520
for the

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,960
electronics software company

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,359
in Phase Two of the Tech Park.

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,520
This is thankless task...

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,400
I'll do it.

23
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,960
Came in too early.

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,400
Morning, Jing.

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,799
Morning.

26
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,079
Awfully chipper today.

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,840
Ms. Rao,

28
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,000
you're looking

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
exceptionally radiant today.

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,199
What do you mean?

31
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,000
I always look radiant, don't I?

32
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,479
Don't you

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,759
remember?

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,039
Remember

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,599
what?

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,479
Last night,

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,680
you

38
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,359
and me,

39
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,759
about that...

40
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:17,960
About what?

41
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,639
That thing.

42
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,879
Speak clearly.

43
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,440
You're making it

44
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,199
sound like

45
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,639
we have an improper relationship.

46
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,840
What improper relationship?

47
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,120
Did you forget about

48
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:27,840
the money you owe me?

49
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,759
I owe you money?

50
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,960
You must be dreaming.

51
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,680
Who's dreaming?

52
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,280
You're so tight with money.

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,160
We will never have

54
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,199
any financial dealings.

55
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,160
Are you crazy?

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:44,359
Come with me.

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,799
Where are you taking me?

59
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,720
Don't get physical.

60
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,039
Just look,

61
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,160
keep a safe distance.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,400
[Ma'am,]

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,160
[I work in this bar.]

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,599
[This gentleman]

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,960
[is worried]

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,039
[you might deny the charges tomorrow...]

67
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,440
Wait,

68
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
skip that part.

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,319
Let me start over.

70
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,240
No, just continue.

71
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,240
So,

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,479
I'm recording a video

73
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,479
for proof.

74
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,919
You spent

75
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,000
8000 yuan here today,

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,560
and this gentleman paid the bill.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,000
It has nothing to do with him.

78
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,000
Keep talking.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,560
Who's denying charges?

80
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,039
Nothing to do with him.

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,599
Then, we need...

82
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:17,560
What proof?

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,079
Just give me another...

84
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:20,479
Ignore her, continue.

85
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,280
Careful, ma'am.

86
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:22,759
Ma'am!

87
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,400
That one's more expensive!

88
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,199
Don't touch that!

89
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,599
-Open the bottle for me!
-Come here!

90
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,000
Pull out that chair

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,679
and let her sit.

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,400
Delete the video.

93
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,080
No way.

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,760
If I delete it,

95
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,679
what if you don't pay me back?

96
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,559
Besides,

97
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,840
this is too good

98
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:37,919
to delete.

99
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,039
I'll keep it as a memento.

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,039
Next year marks

101
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,320
your 8th year at Dairui.

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,439
I'll throw you

103
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,160
a party

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,280
and play

105
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,960
this video.

106
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
I've already got a theme:

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,400
"The Side of Ms. Rao You Didn't Know."

108
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:50,840
Zhao Fanggang,

109
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,039
delete it right now!

110
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,320
No way!

111
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,280
Over my dead body!

112
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,999
Give me the phone.

113
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,400
-Don't grab it.
-Hand it over!

114
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,880
Now.

115
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:08,999
My new phone.

116
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,359
I just bought it half a year ago,

117
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,119
for 10000 yuan!

118
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:12,520
Look,

119
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,960
you've cracked the screen!

120
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,520
You were the one

121
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,239
being careless.

122
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,200
Great,

123
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,359
now it won't even turn on.

124
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,439
How much did you say I owe you?

125
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,080
8000.

126
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Now my phone won't even turn on...

127
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,559
Acting tough now?

128
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,160
Plus the 10000,

129
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,919
I'll give you 18000!

130
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:33,439
When will you pay me?

131
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,559
This lousy door...

132
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,200
Just wait!

133
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,799
She's pretty strong.

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,039
Greetings, President Lin.

135
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:43,720
Greetings, President Lin.

136
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,599
Your S1 has been

137
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,559
really motivated lately.

138
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,359
Morale is up.

139
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,880
I knew bringing you on board was right.

140
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,239
Thank you.

141
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,599
Our team's spirit

142
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,840
has definitely improved,

143
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,919
but we still need

144
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:01,880
to boost our performance.

145
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,320
We're still a bit behind the targets

146
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,840
set by the head office.

147
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,679
By the way,

148
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,559
I plan to focus more

149
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,239
on attracting big clients

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,239
to increase

151
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,799
our total deposits

152
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,119
by the end of the year.

153
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,160
Good.

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,200
I've noticed

155
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,679
that you always succeed

156
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,559
in what you set your mind to.

157
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:28,760
How's it going

158
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,520
with your girlfriend?

159
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,840
[Haven't let work]

160
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
[interfere with your personal life, I hope.]

161
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:35,919
It's all right.

162
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,400
When are you planning to get married?

163
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:43,919
About that,

164
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:45,280
no rush.

165
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,239
Probably next year.

166
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,919
I'll be waiting for the good news.

167
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,679
Yu,

168
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,160
what gifts do young people

169
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,760
usually give for weddings

170
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,439
besides red envelopes?

171
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:17,960
It depends on

172
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,799
how close you are

173
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,559
with the person.

174
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,520
For instance, what would be appropriate

175
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,999
for my relationship with Mr. Ji?

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,200
Mr. Ji?

177
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,679
Is he getting married?

178
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,320
No, no.

179
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,999
Young people tend to have shorter

180
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,039
romance before marriage.

181
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,239
So I want to be prepared.

182
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,080
Forget it.

183
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,080
What's wrong?

184
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,479
You came in

185
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,880
and didn't even have a look at me.

186
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,479
You're on call 24/7

187
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,239
for your boss.

188
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,880
It's so rare to see you,

189
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,119
and you're here acting all reserved.

190
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,280
Are you going to get an award

191
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,960
for this?

192
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,679
I don't want any awards.

193
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:42,359
Such a

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,599
strict sense of duty.

195
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,039
Next time,

196
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,400
don't schedule me

197
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,959
and nanny together.

198
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,559
Next time?

199
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,679
Nanny,

200
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,079
you can leave now.

201
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,839
Keep the rest of the money.

202
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,039
Thanks, Weiyi.

203
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,160
I'll be off then.

204
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:27,400
Weiyi,

205
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,160
see you tomorrow.

206
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,240
All right.

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,839
Do you know

208
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,039
how hard it is to wait for your shift?

209
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,400
It feels like

210
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,600
you're dating your boss,

211
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,039
not me.

212
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:09,559
Speaking of the boss,

213
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,760
he asked me today

214
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,480
how much to give

215
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,160
as a wedding gift for young people.

216
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,880
Are you thinking...

217
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,640
No,

218
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,039
it's Mr. Ji.

219
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,439
But Weiyi,

220
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,000
shouldn't we also...

221
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,760
What,

222
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,280
Xiaoning is getting married?

223
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
Why didn't she tell me?

224
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,360
Wait,

225
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,959
what does Mr. Ji

226
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,679
have to do with Xiaoning?

227
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,199
What's this?

228
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
I'm a rich woman.

229
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,240
How can I let my best friend

230
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,199
eat instant noodles?

231
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,719
After a long day of work,

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,760
you need something good

233
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,520
to recharge.

234
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,520
This meal costs

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,839
two days of my salary.

236
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,079
What?

237
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:09,520
Did you do

238
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,559
something wrong to me?

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't I treat you well?

240
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,559
Yes, you do.

241
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,919
If you don't want this,

242
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,919
I can take you

243
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,719
somewhere else after work.

244
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,919
No need,

245
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:19,719
I haven't had much of an appetite.

246
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,640
All right then.

247
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,000
Isn't this

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Ji Yuheng's

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,360
so-called first love, Tang something?

250
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:36,719
Keep it down.

251
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Don't let others hear

252
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,839
and cause trouble for Ji Yuheng.

253
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
You're already a team,

254
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,000
and you're not even married yet.

255
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,799
We may not have registered,

256
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,039
but

257
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,719
we're like a

258
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,559
normal married couple.

259
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,919
We live together

260
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,199
and share finances.

261
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,480
Causing trouble for him

262
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,000
is like

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,160
causing trouble for myself.

264
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,839
Excuses.

265
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,919
You clearly

266
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,360
like him.

267
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,360
So what?

268
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,199
I don't know

269
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,120
what he thinks.

270
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,880
After the way

271
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,039
he treated you during camping,

272
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,319
you still don't get it?

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,199
I can't know for sure.

274
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,400
If you're unsure, just ask him.

275
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,240
Send him a WeChat message right now.

276
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,079
No, no, no.

277
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:22,839
When we first got together,

278
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,679
it wasn't based on love;

279
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,120
it was because we thought

280
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,079
it was suitable.

281
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,839
Now if I

282
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,199
raise my standards

283
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,520
for love,

284
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,919
wouldn't that be not fair to him?

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,640
Besides,

286
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,600
everyone has the right

287
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
to have a first love.

288
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,160
He hasn't done anything wrong.

289
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,520
Tu Xiaoning,

290
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,160
since when

291
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
did you become so indecisive?

292
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:43,559
How am I indecisive?

293
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:46,880
Fine.

294
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,520
Whatever.

295
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,360
Let me

296
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
give you some advice.

297
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,319
Forget about

298
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,439
his first love.

299
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,559
You're the one who's closest to him now.

300
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,559
Just be flirty,

301
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,039
be passionate, and take initiative.

302
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,799
That's how

303
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,559
you reach the harmony of life.

304
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:03,919
Got it?

305
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,520
I'll pass.

306
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,559
My exams are coming up,

307
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,240
and I don't want to get distracted.

308
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,559
Fine,

309
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,880
do whatever you want.

310
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
You two,

311
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:18,719
one with a clumsy mouth,

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,880
the other with a clumsy brain,

313
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,559
really make a frustrating pair.

314
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:22,439
Don't come to me

315
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,600
with your

316
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,880
emotional issues anymore.

317
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,719
You're the one with problems,

318
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,000
but I'm the one getting stressed out.

319
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,480
My breast

320
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,559
hurts from the stress.

321
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,919
[Unlocked.]

322
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,360
Xiaoning?

323
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,240
[Locked.]

324
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,120
Xiaoning?

325
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,839
Zhao Fanggang's friend?

326
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,640
[Miss Tu,]

327
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
[sorry for the disturbance.]

328
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,439
[I was late and kept you waiting,]

329
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:35,280
[really sorry about that.]

330
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,839
[Are you free this weekend?]

331
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,439
[Let me take you out for a meal.]

332
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,439
She's in the shower.

333
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,039
You're being disturbing.

334
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,520
[You are...?]

335
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,439
Bank

336
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
of Dairui employees

337
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,520
can't use their positions...

338
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,439
Dairui

339
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,160
can't...

340
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,319
inconvenient...

341
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,079
When did you get back?

342
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,079
Listening to the lecture

343
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,400
and doing the exam at the same time?

344
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,120
The exam is coming up.

345
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,839
I wish

346
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,360
I could use

347
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,480
all my senses to study.

348
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,400
Let me see.

349
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,079
You got the sync rate indicator wrong,

350
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,319
and the case analysis management

351
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,439
system choice is incorrect.

352
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:53,760
Look again.

353
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,719
Let me see.

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,559
Choose A.

355
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:00,880
A?

356
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,240
Are you sure?

357
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:03,799
Not very sure.

358
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:05,959
You've already got

359
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,360
the management mode application system

360
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,160
question right,

361
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,799
how could you get this one wrong?

362
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,160
Think again.

363
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,600
Choose B.

364
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,039
Sure?

365
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,039
Correct.

366
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,280
[Forget about]

367
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,600
[his first love.]

368
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,799
[You're the one who's closest to him now.]

369
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,239
-You...
-You...

370
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,040
You go first.

371
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,919
I'm upset

372
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
not because of my period.

373
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:03,160
I know.

374
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,439
Tang Yuhui may call me senior,

375
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,199
but we hardly

376
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,519
ever talked

377
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,519
in school

378
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:12,800
and we're not close.

379
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,439
Her transfer to S1

380
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,279
was a decision by the bank,

381
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,519
not arranged by me.

382
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
If you weren't with me,

383
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,560
who would you be with?

384
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,479
If I was the first one to approach you

385
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,040
after high school graduation,

386
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:34,959
would you have said yes?

387
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:39,199
True,

388
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:39,800
life doesn't have

389
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,199
that many "what ifs."

390
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,199
Back then, you didn't like me anyway.

391
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:47,919
Life doesn't have "what ifs,"

392
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,519
so I would

393
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,400
still be with you.

394
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,560
I won't think about this anymore.

395
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,600
The exam is coming up,

396
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,400
and I've already wasted

397
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,519
too much time on this.

398
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,040
No more thinking about it.

399
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,880
We'll talk about it

400
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,519
after the exam.

401
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,439
This is so gross.

402
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:32,800
I'm serious.

403
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,959
How do

404
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,040
cows and sheep

405
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,279
survive on

406
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,439
leaves like this?

407
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,360
Just deal with it

408
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,400
if you wanted

409
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,519
your abs back

410
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,320
after seeing Qi Yu's

411
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,279
six-pack.

412
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,719
Even if you're rich,

413
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,600
love makes everyone equal.

414
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:51,880
What are you doing?

415
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,120
Since you're studying,

416
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,120
eat less.

417
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,160
And

418
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,080
about his first love

419
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,040
you mentioned,

420
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,439
you have to give her some pressure.

421
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,199
Whose first love?

422
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,479
First love is for memory.

423
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,519
So things have turned around?

424
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,919
He

425
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,160
doesn't like Tang Yuhui.

426
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,400
Then who's the cheerful girl

427
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,320
with the high ponytail

428
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,479
you mentioned?

429
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,600
It's not you, right?

430
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,199
I don't care who she is.

431
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,320
I just want to study,

432
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,679
pass the exam,

433
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,279
and have a relaxing

434
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,120
New Year day.

435
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,479
You're definitely

436
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,239
in the sweetest stage of ambiguity.

437
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,840
Listen,

438
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,959
just don't

439
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,239
rush things.

440
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,320
Keep it balanced,

441
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,479
under your control.

442
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:38,959
Enjoy the push

443
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,239
and pull.

444
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,719
Didn't you just say

445
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,679
to flirt and get passionate?

446
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,360
That was

447
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,120
when you loved him,

448
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,560
but he loved her.

449
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:50,439
You both

450
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,919
needed to use your bodies

451
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,400
to find the answer.

452
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,120
But now,

453
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,719
it's pure love,

454
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,600
so take it slow.

455
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,679
One step at a time.

456
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,719
My love advisor,

457
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,679
what do you want to eat?

458
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,479
It's on me.

459
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:07,800
Tell me more.

460
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,880
I want meat,

461
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,080
lots of meat.

462
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,120
For your own good,

463
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:11,840
let's skip that.

464
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,199
Don't forget your abs.

465
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Oh right,

466
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,719
it's working well.

467
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:21,679
What's wrong?

468
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,120
The KPIs

469
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,759
set by the boss

470
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,120
are too hard to meet.

471
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,759
It's almost the end of the year,

472
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,759
and I'm still 20%

473
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,519
short of the target.

474
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,400
Will he cut my year-end bonus

475
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,120
because of this?

476
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,279
I don't think so.

477
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,800
He's only been here for 2 months,

478
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,439
and

479
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,759
the previous deficits

480
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,600
shouldn't be

481
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,160
held against us.

482
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:44,560
Don't worry,

483
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,679
he's not

484
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,479
unreasonable.

485
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,600
Li Xiang,

486
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,959
don't just think, do it.

487
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:49,880
Come on,

488
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:50,479
work hard!

489
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:53,840
Xu Li,

490
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,919
here's a deposit of 10 million dollars.

491
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,120
Sign here

492
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
to confirm my performance.

493
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,800
10 million?

494
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,840
Dollars?

495
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,320
This is from a trading company

496
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,679
my dad worked with.

497
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,640
They handle

498
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,080
large sums daily,

499
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,679
so I reached out

500
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,679
to their financial director

501
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:15,400
and moved

502
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,519
some funds here.

503
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,160
All right.

504
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,959
Which import-export company?

505
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,360
Shunjue.

506
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,840
Okay, Yuhui,

507
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,199
at this rate,

508
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,479
you'll become a full-fledged

509
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,360
account manager soon.

510
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,479
Thanks, Xu Li.

511
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,160
I'll keep pushing.

512
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,400
[She definitely has connections.]

513
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,439
[A single call,]

514
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,439
[and she gets]

515
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,439
[10 million dollars from Shunjue.]

516
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:39,919
[I spent months]

517
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,600
[with Mr. Jiang and]

518
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,279
[couldn't even get through their door.]

519
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,840
[It's not the first day

520
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,239
[you know about her background.]

521
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,080
[Do her parents]

522
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,239
[need a son?]

523
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,719
[Your stupidity]

524
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,320
[never cease to amaze me.]

525
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,560
[Are we forming a clique?]

526
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,719
[Not really.]

527
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,840
[We're having a normal conversation]

528
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,320
[between mentors and mentee.]

529
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,670
[Xiaoning is my mentee.]

530
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,040
[Stop trying to bond with us.]

531
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,320
Sir.

532
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,880
Yuhui just signed a 10-million deposits.

533
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,430
Dollars!

534
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,950
It's a big deal!

535
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,560
Did you?

536
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,320
Congratulations.

537
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,320
Mr. Ji.

538
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,190
I'd like to take you out

539
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,750
tonight to celebrate.

540
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,800
I'll take you all to karaoke.

541
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,640
[Great!]

542
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,840
[We can go together.]

543
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,040
I'll pass.

544
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,750
I have a

545
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,910
family thing to do tonight.

546
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,750
"A family thing".

547
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,080
Xiaoning.

548
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,880
Let me ask you.

549
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,270
Just ask, Fanggang.

550
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,040
You don't have to do it secretly.

551
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,510
I'm afraid I could reveal

552
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,270
your secret.

553
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,670
What secret?

554
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,160
That brother of my friend.

555
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,880
That blind date for you.

556
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,560
He called you.

557
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,600
A man answered.

558
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,600
And,

559
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,160
he,

560
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,800
he hung up the phone

561
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,710
before he had chance to ask.

562
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,600
Who's that?

563
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,750
My dad.

564
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Your, your dad?

565
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,800
You're a woman now, and he

566
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,560
still filter blind dates for you?

567
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,190
I'm having a hard time

568
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,800
preparing for the test.

569
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,080
He doesn't want me to get distracted.

570
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,470
The career matters more.

571
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,400
Besides,

572
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,230
all my dates have to

573
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,430
get through to my parents.

574
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,360
Daughters are delicate.

575
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,990
Fathers

576
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,270
are on their toes.

577
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,750
But daughters are more lovable than sons.

578
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,510
[Naive.]

579
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,640
[Xiaoning.]

580
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,950
[Don't talk about personal matters]

581
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,990
[during working hours.]

582
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,710
Feet up.

583
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,160
I haven't finished.

584
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,910
You did that on purpose!

585
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,190
Yes, I did.

586
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,120
I told you

587
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,160
to take a break.

588
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,990
You've been studying too hard.

589
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,910
Relax.

590
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,910
You're done cleaning.

591
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,470
But I'm not done reviewing.

592
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,040
Give it back.

593
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,600
No.

594
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,270
Give it back!

595
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,040
No!

596
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,320
Give it back.

597
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,080
Never mind.

598
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,270
Don't be mad.

599
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,400
I just think that

600
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,710
you're studying hard every day.

601
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,800
Relaxation is good

602
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,880
for better performance.

603
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,840
I'm not mad.

604
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,800
Next week,

605
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,600
mom will go home

606
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,710
from the hospital.

607
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,750
I'm afraid I won't have time

608
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,430
to study anymore.

609
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,840
So I have to

610
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,670
study now.

611
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,470
So that's the reason.

612
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,360
Don't worry.

613
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,320
When she comes back,

614
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,160
I'll take care of her.

615
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,320
No!

616
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,120
You'll be exhausted

617
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
if you do it alone.

618
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,840
I can help you with it.

619
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Well,

620
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,670
shouldn't we change

621
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,880
the bed in the study?

622
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,160
If Mom comes back...

623
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,670
I said don't worry.

624
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,910
I've ordered a new bed

625
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,360
and it's already delivered.

626
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,360
Do you know what to do next?

627
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,120
No.

628
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,190
I just know that

629
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,880
Mr. Ji is clever and handy,

630
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
while I'm clumsy

631
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,470
and not much help.

632
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,880
Well,

633
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,910
when I'm the leader

634
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,670
at work,

635
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,510
you can be the leader

636
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,510
at home.

637
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,560
If I'm the leader,

638
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,990
I won't let my man

639
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,270
work alone.

640
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,230
How about

641
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,880
I help you clean up.

642
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,040
I'll appreciate

643
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,750
your effort.

644
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,040
You're welcome.

645
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,120
That's all

646
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,190
I can do.

647
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,120
[The size is just right.]

648
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,560
Xiaoning.

649
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,160
Get me something.

650
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,230
What is it?

651
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,950
The No. 5 nut on the floor.

652
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,080
It's almost done.

653
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:26,950
Yuheng.

654
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,670
Maybe I should stay here

655
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,750
for a while longer?

656
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,040
I'm getting used to living here.

657
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,040
It's also convenient.

658
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,360
Mom.

659
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,750
The doctor said that

660
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,710
you can be discharged

661
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,600
in your current condition.

662
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,470
Besides, living

663
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,470
at home will

664
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,230
help you recover.

665
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,320
How about

666
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,640
I go back to

667
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,430
my own place?

668
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,710
What if you

669
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,800
get tired cooking

670
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,040
by yourself when you live alone?

671
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,510
If I don't want to cook,

672
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,510
I will order takeout.

673
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,710
I won't starve myself.

674
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,600
You can't live on takeouts!

675
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,040
What's wrong?

676
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,080
Mom.

677
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,190
You don't want to live with us?

678
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,880
You're all busy

679
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,320
at work.

680
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,710
Don't you have

681
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,600
an exam to prepare

682
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,160
for these days?

683
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,710
If I live with you,

684
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,750
I might weigh you down.

685
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
So you still want to

686
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,560
live with us.

687
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
That's all that matters.

688
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,710
Are you afraid your daughter-in-law

689
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,750
won't get along?

690
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,840
Nonsense!

691
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,470
Then come with us.

692
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,360
Yuheng's been expecting your discharge

693
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,510
for a long time.

694
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,270
Let's go home.

695
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,040
Go home.

696
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,910
You're a nice couple,

697
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,710
and nice sons and daughters.

698
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,910
You're so lucky.

699
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,710
Enjoy your family time.

700
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,910
Okay.

701
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,750
Let's go.

702
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,230
Let's go home.

703
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,800
Let's go.

704
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,710
Be careful.

705
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,230
I need to

706
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,190
enjoy my family time.

707
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,160
Good bye.

708
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,750
Good bye.

709
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,670
Get well soon.

710
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,670
Its lips are still moving.

711
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Don't be scared.

712
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,320
No, no, no.

713
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,470
How about you...

714
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,800
Don't just look!

715
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,670
Come and help me!

716
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,910
You said to do it yourself.

717
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,800
Without help.

718
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,230
But it's not the same

719
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,320
as what I've read.

720
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,470
According to the recipes,

721
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,230
the fish can go straight into the pan.

722
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,710
I take care of it.

723
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,040
The fish must be cleaned first.

724
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,470
Usually, this kind of work

725
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,400
is done by assistants.

726
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,600
You're the chef.

727
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,470
Leave it to me.

728
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,800
Okay.

729
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,560
Then I'll leave it to you.

730
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,800
I'll cook when you've done.

731
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,400
I'll take over from now on.

732
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,120
Leave it to me.

733
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,320
Are you sure?

734
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,320
Yes.

735
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,430
Be careful.

736
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,840
Don't forget flavorings.

737
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,320
Right.

738
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,230
Ji Yuheng!

739
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,560
Help!

740
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,510
No.

741
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,190
You're not leading us anywhere.

742
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,600
Is this the place?

743
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,600
I think I got it right this time.

744
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,670
This should be it.

745
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,670
Don't you think you're overconfident?

746
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,470
See? See?

747
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,430
I told you.

748
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,600
You were right.

749
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,360
Mom. Dad.

750
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,880
Come on in.

751
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,040
Come in.

752
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,670
What about shoes?

753
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,670
-Do I need to take them off?
-Yes.

754
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,400
Here, Mrs. Ji.

755
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,710
Have some chicken soup.

756
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,430
Xiaoning's dad has been

757
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,750
working on it all afternoon.

758
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,400
It's tasteful.

759
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,840
Isn't it?

760
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,040
Try it.

761
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,800
Thank you

762
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
for all these dishes.

763
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,670
It's okay.

764
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,840
Try this.

765
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,120
Mom, have a try.

766
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,080
It smells so good.

767
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,600
Why didn't you tell me before coming?

768
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,400
If I knew you had made

769
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,710
such a great meal,

770
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,120
I wouldn't have

771
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,080
almost

772
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,360
blown up the kitchen.

773
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,470
Don't you have self-knowledge

774
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,360
that you're not born to cook.

775
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,230
You know your daughter.

776
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,270
She's showy.

777
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,880
Overconfident.

778
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,710
I have to say,

779
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,710
it's just like her father.

780
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,430
Confident but humble.

781
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,040
I know Xiaoning

782
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,270
was trying to take care of me.

783
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,670
It doesn't matter

784
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,040
if she can cook or not.

785
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,990
She's busy at work.

786
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,120
She should have

787
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,990
had rest at home.

788
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,560
From now on,

789
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,360
you can focus on your work.

790
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,360
I stay here and cook for you.

791
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,430
That's not fair.

792
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,040
Mrs. Ji,

793
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,910
the kids brought you here

794
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,950
to take care of you.

795
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,840
If you keep doing

796
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,320
chores for them,

797
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,270
they'll feel sorry.

798
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,840
He's right.

799
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,670
And I've got a caregiver.

800
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,990
They cook during the day.

801
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,120
I make dinner.

802
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,230
That'll be great!

803
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,160
Okay.

804
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,270
This is a good idea.

805
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,230
Don't move.

806
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,160
What?

807
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,670
Turn around.

808
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,270
You got a smudge on your nose.

809
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,560
It might be from my glove.

810
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,880
Alright.

811
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,840
I'll listen to you.

812
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,510
Then

813
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,640
Yuheng

814
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,910
will cook for us.

815
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,470
Xiaoning,

816
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,190
we can watch TV

817
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,670
on sofa,

818
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,800
or enjoy ourselves.

819
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,400
Wait until dinner's ready.

820
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,430
-Right. 
-Wait until dinner's ready.

821
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,080
Here.

822
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,800
Let's have a drink.

823
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,080
Okay.

824
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,120
Thank you so much.

825
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,840
It's okay.

826
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,640
It's okay.

827
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,670
To your health!

828
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,080
I'll cook again if you like.

829
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,560
Here you are.

830
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,270
Thank you.

831
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,230
Alright.

832
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,990
You get some rest, too.

833
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,160
I'm going to sleep.

834
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,640
How about

835
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,190
I keep you company?

836
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,560
I can take care of you

837
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,080
if you want water or something.

838
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,840
Silly.

839
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,430
It's not like I can't move myself.

840
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,840
I'm okay.

841
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
You don't have to take care of me.

842
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,190
I can't waste

843
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,430
the time of the newlyweds.

844
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,320
Go. Go.

845
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,880
She's used to sleeping alone.

846
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,950
Let's go back to our room.

847
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,830
Go.

848
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,560
Okay.

849
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,160
Good night.

850
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:47,830
I think

851
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,920
I'll take the couch.

852
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,040
No way.

853
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,040
What if Mom sees us

854
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,600
and thinks we're having a fight?

855
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,710
How would you explain?

856
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,080
The bed is big enough.

857
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,920
We take each side.

858
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,600
It can work.

859
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,830
You sure?

860
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,120
Yeah.

861
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,390
Well,

862
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,480
which side do you prefer?

863
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,600
I'll take this side.

864
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,270
Then I'll take the other.

865
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,270
Then,

866
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,440
you get sleep.

867
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,080
I have to study for a while.

868
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,830
Don't stay up too late.

869
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,920
Good night.

870
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,160
Good night.

871
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,000
You're up?

872
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,440
You're up.

873
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,560
Breakfast is ready.

874
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,440
Okay.

875
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,480
A minute.

876
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,790
Why didn't you

877
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,830
wake me up?

878
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,600
Mom would

879
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,790
think I'm lazy

880
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,870
and I like to stay in bed.

881
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,040
It could ruin my image.

882
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,710
Do you worry about your image

883
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,040
in front of your own mom?

884
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,960
That's different.

885
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,790
What's the difference?

886
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,870
We're a family now.

887
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,390
Here. Have a seat.

888
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,830
I got you coffee.

889
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Your favorite.

890
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,960
No.

891
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
I'll prepare breakfast tomorrow.

892
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,040
You're studying so late every day.

893
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,230
Yesterday it was until 2:00 a.m.

894
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,560
If you have to make breakfast early,

895
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,790
you're making your life

896
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,960
a triathlon.

897
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,600
Xiaoning.

898
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,390
You only slept

899
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,230
four hours yesterday.

900
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,710
Mom, I'm used to it.

901
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,350
I don't sleep much.

902
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,080
Here.

903
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,230
You didn't sleep well.

904
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,120
Don't drink coffee.

905
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,350
It's bad for your heart.

906
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,440
Have some milk.

907
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,560
She's used to it.

908
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:03,960
Yeah.

909
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,750
I get sleepy at work in the morning

910
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,870
if I don't drink coffee.

911
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Xiaoning,

912
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,520
you have to study

913
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,520
for your test,

914
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,350
and you have to work.

915
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,040
Don't worry about

916
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,270
all these chores.

917
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,960
You don't have to make breakfast.

918
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,560
And don't treat me like a patient.

919
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,440
Look at me.

920
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,710
I'm perfectly fine.

921
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
But you two.

922
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,160
Don't take your good health for granted

923
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,270
just because

924
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,040
you're young.

925
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,120
That's how the health

926
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,350
breaks down,

927
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,830
little by little.

928
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,160
Okay.

929
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,600
Alright.

930
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,920
It's still early for work.

931
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,790
Have the breakfast and

932
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,710
go back to sleep.

933
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,830
Extra sleep is the best.

934
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,190
Let's eat.

935
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,390
It's year end. Don't stall any longer.

936
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,080
Don't pretend it didn't happen.

937
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:01,870
Ms. Rao.

938
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,270
I'm the debtor.

939
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,120
You owe my money.

940
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,480
You'd be forced to be my servant

941
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,230
if it's in feudal society.

942
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,390
Mr. Zhao.

943
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,920
You do look like

944
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,710
an evil landlord.

945
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,080
Besides,

946
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,310
I didn't say I was going to renege.

947
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,190
I'll

948
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,390
pay you back as soon as

949
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,080
I get my fourth quarter bonus.

950
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,270
I wonder,

951
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,390
don't you save any money?

952
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,440
As a debtor,

953
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,350
don't you have too many questions?

954
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,040
What's it to you

955
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,870
if I save money or not?

956
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,310
What if you have an emergency

957
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,440
and you need money?

958
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,350
It's easy.

959
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,270
If I don't need much,

960
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,040
I use my credit card.

961
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
If it's much, I get a loan.

962
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,790
If that wouldn't suffice,

963
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,520
my car, my bags,

964
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,270
I can put them up

965
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,120
as collateral.

966
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,120
Besides,

967
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,870
I've been in the bank for years.

968
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,920
I have a steady income.

969
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,120
I have a financial mindset.

970
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,120
You think I'm gonna plunge into

971
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,750
abject poverty?

972
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,040
Is that all?

973
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,480
Where's my money?

974
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,640
I told you I'll pay you back

975
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,830
when I get my fourth quarter

976
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,600
bonus.

977
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,270
You're a banker.

978
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,560
Don't you know that

979
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,920
money in the bank

980
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,080
accrues interest?

981
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,710
Mr. Zhao.

982
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,350
You're talking to me

983
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,080
for the interest?

984
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,040
Easy.

985
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,710
I'll pay you back

986
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,520
at a percentage point over

987
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,350
the fixed deposit rate of our bank.

988
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,000
Not enough.

989
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,640
1.5 percentage point.

990
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,480
Deal.

991
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,190
We'll count it from the day you got drunk.

992
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,190
You evil landlord.

993
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,270
I don't care what you call me.

994
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,000
Espresso.

995
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,270
Mr. Zhao can finally take care of himself.

996
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,480
You don't need Xiaoning to serve you?

997
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
I don't dare to disturb her.

998
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,310
Look at her.

999
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,670
She's been studying so hard.

1000
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,080
I won't take a risk to waste

1001
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,710
her time making my coffee.

1002
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,480
I'd feel guilty for a long-long time

1003
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,440
if she fails the test

1004
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
because of me.

1005
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,230
Don't jinx it.

1006
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,230
She hasn't taken the test yet.

1007
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,390
Don't say anything ominous.

1008
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,600
I didn't mean that.

1009
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,600
She's been studying

1010
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,390
at the cost of her health.

1011
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,160
She's pining away.

1012
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,560
The exam is in two days.

1013
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,310
She'd be so sad

1014
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,870
if she shouldn't pass the test,

1015
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,520
wouldn't she?

1016
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,270
Mr. Zhao.

1017
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,040
You are so busy all day long.

1018
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,190
You need to collect a debt,

1019
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,000
and to take care of Xiaoning.

1020
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,870
So busy.

1021
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,270
Xiaoning.

1022
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,600
You got a cold?

1023
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,870
Seems so, Fanggang.

1024
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,270
I've got malva nut.

1025
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,710
I'll give you some.

1026
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,600
No, thank you.

1027
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,440
I'm okay.

1028
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,040
Xiaoning.

1029
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,390
Are you okay?

1030
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,520
I've taken my pills.

1031
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,560
Thank you for your concern.

1032
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,190
I'm okay.

1033
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,440
Are you sure?

1034
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,230
Yes.

1035
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm fine. Really.

1036
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,230
Sorry, Xiaoning.

1037
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,160
I forgot where

1038
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,960
my malva nut is.

1039
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,560
Uh,

1040
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,040
I'll order it online.

1041
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,670
Where's my phone?

1042
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,040
Xiaoning.

1043
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:27,870
Xiaoning?

1044
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,440
Wake up.

1045
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,120
What?

1046
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,440
Was I too noisy?

1047
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,190
It's late.

1048
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,440
Go back to bed.

1049
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,870
I'll carry you.

1050
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,640
Good night.

1051
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,560
Good night.
