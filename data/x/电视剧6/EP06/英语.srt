00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,120
You Are My Secret EP06

3
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
Good dogs don't block the way, you know.

4
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,599
A new hire at our company?

5
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,200
How would I know?

6
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,519
I didn't get any notice.

7
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,080
Do you see how tall he is?

8
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,679
How could I?

9
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,840
Anyway, he looks

10
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,119
tall and slim,

11
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:20,759
with a clean face.

12
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:22,759
He's my type.

13
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,160
Look at him smiling like that.

14
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,720
A man without self-respect

15
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
is like rotten cabbage.

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
He's just smiling normally.

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,479
Are you implying something

18
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,560
about me?

19
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,240
Even rotten cabbage

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
can get infested with worms,

21
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,479
but what's worse

22
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,799
is when the cabbage rots away

23
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,960
in a corner, completely ignored.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Who's completely ignored?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm proudly single.

26
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,639
Qi Yu?

27
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,359
Xiaoning?

28
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,879
How fancy!

29
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,079
Long time no see.

30
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,079
What are you doing here?

31
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,240
I came to...

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,720
Qi Yu?

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,840
Mr. Ji.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,799
Hello.

35
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,440
Hello.

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,039
Turns out,

37
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,000
it's old friends reuniting.

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,520
Did the president arrive

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,280
at the provincial office last night?

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,199
Yes.

41
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,799
President?

42
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,720
He won't be back for a couple of days.

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,359
President?

44
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,599
He asked me to bring you some documents

45
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,879
and check in on you.

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,599
How's your arm?

47
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:40,879
Much better,

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,599
thanks for asking.

49
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,280
All right,

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,079
please come to the office.

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,440
President?

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,319
What's going on?

53
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm his new driver.

54
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:54,359
Heading in now.

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,199
Okay, okay.

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:01,919
Jing,

57
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:03,560
I brought back the documents you needed.

58
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,680
You can leave.

59
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,160
Okay.

60
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,199
Xiaoning,

61
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,720
so you work here too?

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,160
I've been here for a while.

63
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,440
When did you come back,

64
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
and why did you decide to return?

65
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:23,240
For the reason you're thinking.

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:27,840
You...

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,439
you...

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,760
I know what you wanna say,

69
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,599
but I still

70
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:34,479
wanna give it another try.

71
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,200
So, have you

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,359
thought about what to do next?

73
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:38,919
So he's the

74
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,720
president's driver?

75
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,599
Yes, yes.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
Mr. Zhao.

77
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:46,880
You two...

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,960
are you in that kind of relationship?

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,239
What kind of relationship?

80
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:59,080
Qi Yu come here because of you?

81
00:04:59,439 --> 00:04:59,960
No.

82
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:00,840
No, no, no,

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,559
you misunderstood, Mr. Zhao.

84
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,359
Then isn't this

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,039
an office romance?

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,880
Dating on company time,

87
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
how bold.

88
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,080
It's thrilling

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,840
and romantic.

90
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:11,320
No,

91
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,119
what thrill, what romance?

92
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,799
I think he's funny.

93
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,320
Yeah,

94
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
why is that?

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,160
Last time.

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,119
So bad.

97
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,439
Send this to me, send it to me.

98
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,320
Okay.

99
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:34,679
I'll send it to you.

100
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:35,439
Okay.

101
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,160
Everyone,

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,840
it's been an hour since work started,

103
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,960
and you've been away for so long?

104
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,439
What?

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,840
Is there something

106
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,039
urgent work-related?

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,880
I was in a rush this morning and

108
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,280
didn't have time to use the bathroom,

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,239
so I had to go.

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,760
A group bathroom break?

111
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,320
For an hour?

112
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:00,919
Looks like you drank a lot yesterday.

113
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,239
Xu Li,

114
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,280
your client decided to come over

115
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,320
unexpectedly,

116
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,479
but he couldn't find you,

117
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,919
so I handled it.

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,520
This shouldn't

119
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,599
happen again.

120
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,400
What are you standing there for?

121
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,679
Hurry up and thank Mr. Ji.

122
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,479
Thank you...

123
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,039
Mr. Ji...

124
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,679
Also, Li Xiang, this is

125
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,119
your third time being late this week.

126
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,160
According to Dairui's regulations,

127
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,039
you'll lose half a month's bonus.

128
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,200
Three strikes, and next time

129
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,559
you'll either be transferred

130
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,840
or terminated.

131
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,119
What?

132
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,559
You can't just terminate me.

133
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,400
I have a formal contract.

134
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,479
As an employee of this company,

135
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
you must follow

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,479
its rules and regulations.

137
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:48,960
Mr. Ji,

138
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,280
what do you mean by this?

139
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,880
Mr. Ji,

140
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,239
Li Xiang lives far away,

141
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,359
and sometimes the elevator

142
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,320
delays his punch-in

143
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,160
by a minute or two.

144
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,200
It's not intentional.

145
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,320
Mr. Ji, you mentioned rules,

146
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,160
so let's follow them.

147
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,320
Now it's work time.

148
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:11,799
Everyone,

149
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,880
get back to work!

150
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:25,559
Fanggang,

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,200
good thing you were here today,

152
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
otherwise this

153
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,119
could have gotten out of hand.

154
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,439
Fanggang, if not for giving you face...

155
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,239
All right, all right.

156
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:32,840
Listen to me,

157
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,559
let's all keep

158
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
a low profile for a while.

159
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,080
We don't want

160
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,479
the Compliance Dept

161
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:41,960
catching us on anything.

162
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,320
Get back to work.

163
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,679
Calm down.

164
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,160
It's fine.

165
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,119
Grab your medical kit

166
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,479
and come to the rooftop.

167
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,039
Why,

168
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,880
found a new meeting spot?

169
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,880
The stairwell isn't safe anymore.

170
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,999
From now on,

171
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,039
if we need to talk,

172
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,400
we'll do it on the rooftop.

173
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,439
Why are you staring at me?

174
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,919
The stairwell isn't safe anymore?

175
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,319
What do you mean?

176
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,400
You know about Qi Yu?

177
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,439
Know what,

178
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,480
that you and Qi Yu

179
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,640
were seen talking in the stairwell

180
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
by Zhao Fanggang and the others,

181
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,039
and they said

182
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,039
he's your suitor

183
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,319
or ex-boyfriend?

184
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,439
Don't listen to their nonsense.

185
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,079
What suitor, what ex-boyfriend?

186
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,719
We have nothing to do with each other.

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,640
It's already enough of a headache

188
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,760
working in the same company as you.

189
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,959
Do you think I'm crazy enough

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
to bring an ex-boyfriend here?

191
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,160
I know.

192
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,360
What do you know?

193
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,839
You've only had one relationship, right?

194
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,400
Given your character,

195
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,360
it's impossible for you

196
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,199
to have two exes at the same time

197
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,199
in one relationship.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,319
Ouch.

199
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,199
Serves you right.

200
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,719
Do you enjoy

201
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,360
having control

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,480
over others?

203
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,959
You know

204
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,719
Qi Yu and I

205
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,959
have nothing to do with each other,

206
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,160
yet you still tease me.

207
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,559
You knew

208
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,760
where Mr. Zhao went,

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
but you still asked,

210
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,520
to make an example of him.

211
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,799
So you think

212
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,719
I'm just scaring them?

213
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:53,919
Shouldn't Li Xiang and the others

214
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,839
be punished?

215
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,640
They should be punished,

216
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,480
but

217
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,039
you should also give them some face.

218
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:00,839
Otherwise,

219
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:01,959
you'll lose their support.

220
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,240
All thanks to Mr. Zhao.

221
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,439
Is this good enough?

222
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,319
Regarding Qi Yu, although

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,679
we have nothing to do with each other,

224
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,799
since

225
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,640
we work at the same bank,

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,640
we should hide

227
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,400
our relationship

228
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,719
from him.

229
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,160
You two are classmates?

230
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,719
Not just classmates,

231
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,679
he's my

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,039
best friend's

233
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:31,959
ex-boyfriend.

234
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,839
I don't even know

235
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,280
what will happen

236
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,000
if they meet.

237
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
Haven't been here in a few days,

238
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,439
why is it so busy here?

239
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
Suddenly so many people,

240
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,000
are they

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,439
hired to line up?

242
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,760
You don't know?

243
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,240
Yesterday this store

244
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
started a group-buy promotion

245
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,959
on the short video platform.

246
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,199
Buy two, get one free

247
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:02,959
on their famous cheesecake.

248
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,160
Today is the first day.

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
So if I don't use the group-buy,

250
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,319
I don't have to line up?

251
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,559
Big spender, huh?

252
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,919
Everyone's lining up here.

253
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,360
You think you can cut the line?

254
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,400
Nothing is impossible

255
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,199
if you're willing to give up.

256
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,360
I won't eat here.

257
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,039
You've been hungry all day.

258
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,959
Just eat.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,400
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,520
It was my fault before.

261
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,120
My parents

262
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,160
want me to move back home,

263
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,880
and I didn't wanna disappoint them.

264
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,919
I neglected your feelings,

265
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:41,760
I'm really sorry.

266
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,480
You're not wrong.

267
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Life has more than

268
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,240
one path to choose from.

269
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,760
You made your choice.

270
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,400
There's nothing wrong with that.

271
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,079
I was wrong.

272
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,120
I thought I could

273
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,559
balance our relationship...

274
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,319
Weiyi,

275
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,520
I found a job

276
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,319
in your building.

277
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,000
It's stable,

278
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,919
and I won't be away anymore.

279
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,959
I'll be here whenever

280
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,439
you need me.

281
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
No wonder Xiaoning called me.

282
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
You guys met at work?

283
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,319
I joined Dairui

284
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:33,719
to be the president's driver.

285
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,520
I can tell you everything

286
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,559
you wanna know.

287
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,280
But you've been hungry all day.

288
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,319
Want to eat something first?

289
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,880
I got you your favorite...

290
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,360
How did you know

291
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,079
I've been hungry all day?

292
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,439
Xiaoning told me

293
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:46,799
you took a leave today to rest at home.

294
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:47,679
You always forget

295
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,760
to eat and keep irregular hours

296
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,439
when you sleep,

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,719
how could I not know?

298
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,520
You still know me so well.

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,959
Then you should know

300
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:58,439
I'm not one

301
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:59,319
to take back an ex.

302
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,120
Qi Yu,

303
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,079
you're already history to me.

304
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,079
I admit,

305
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,000
I was waiting for you to regret

306
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,880
and come back.

307
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,360
But now,

308
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:23,480
that means

309
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,280
nothing to me.

310
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,079
Hey man,

311
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:55,880
you on duty today?

312
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:56,480
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,039
Here, have a cigarette.

314
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,520
No, I can't.

315
00:14:58,839 --> 00:14:59,760
Take it, just take it.

316
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:00,839
Don't be shy.

317
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:01,360
Please.

318
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,919
Just take it.

319
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,360
Thanks.

320
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,280
How's it going

321
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,160
in the park lately?

322
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:04,919
It's been good,

323
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,959
lots of people around.

324
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,160
Mr. Wu's car is over there.

325
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,280
Thanks.

326
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,039
No problem.

327
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,120
Wondering why

328
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,240
I chatted so long with the gatekeeper

329
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,839
when he's just part of the park

330
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:21,160
and not related

331
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,880
to the companies inside?

332
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,760
I was a bit curious.

333
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,199
The guardroom

334
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,880
is a hub for gossip.

335
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:28,880
The gatekeepers

336
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,439
know every

337
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,880
boss's car,

338
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,039
their schedules,

339
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,760
and even their personalities.

340
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,039
But I remember the boss here

341
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,839
said

342
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,439
they don't need loans.

343
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,280
I get it,

344
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,319
Mr. Zhao, you're thinking just because

345
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,480
they don't need it now

346
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,559
doesn't mean they won't in the future.

347
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,199
So you come by

348
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,039
to leave an impression,

349
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,240
so when they need it,

350
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,199
they'll think of you first.

351
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,480
You're good.

352
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,199
Marketing isn't about quick wins.

353
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,360
Even the best companies

354
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,919
have cash flow

355
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,199
issues sometimes.

356
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,000
We need to play

357
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,880
the long game.

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,480
Come on,

359
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,480
it's almost lunchtime.

360
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,959
Have something to eat.

361
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,919
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

362
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,559
You're welcome.

363
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,160
So,

364
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,799
you're shadowing me

365
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,959
to learn about the park's business

366
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
for your

367
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,000
regularization exam, right?

368
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,839
I did sign up for

369
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,439
some online courses

370
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,280
for the regularization exam after work,

371
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,520
but I found

372
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,439
I lack practical experience,

373
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,880
so I don't fully understand everything.

374
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,400
You're right.

375
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,439
Marketing

376
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,079
requires adaptability.

377
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,199
It's not just about book knowledge;

378
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,120
you have to use your head.

379
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,240
Mr. Zhao,

380
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:52,719
I know

381
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:53,959
it's not your duty to teach me,

382
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,079
but you've been so patient

383
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:55,959
and taught me so much.

384
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,199
I've learned a lot from

385
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,400
shadowing you in the park.

386
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,319
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

387
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,000
You're welcome.

388
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,799
When I first joined Dairui,

389
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,959
a senior guided me

390
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,000
and taught me hands-on.

391
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,679
Now that I'm the senior,

392
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,520
I have to pass on

393
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,039
such good traditions.

394
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,799
If you really wanna thank me,

395
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,600
stop calling me Mr. Zhao.

396
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:19,519
It sounds too formal.

397
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,679
Just call me

398
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,080
Fanggang.

399
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,560
By the way,

400
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,759
is that driver your boyfriend?

401
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,199
No.

402
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:32,679
Don't lie.

403
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:33,719
I think you're

404
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,519
a good match.

405
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:35,880
But

406
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:37,519
keep it low-key.

407
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,479
It still counts as an office romance.

408
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,279
He's really not!

409
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,279
Listen,

410
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,679
it's better not to admit it,

411
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,759
or you'll get caught

412
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,640
and made an example of.

413
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,719
If you're late,

414
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,919
you would lose half a month's bonus.

415
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:55,279
If you're exposed,

416
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,160
he would

417
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,320
make you... pay back

418
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
the company money,

419
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,919
or worse,

420
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:01,840
fire you on the spot.

421
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
You mean...

422
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,080
Mr. Ji?

423
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
I don't think he's that kind of person.

424
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,959
Do you know what kinda person he is?

425
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,880
Are you his partner

426
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,080
or something?

427
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,279
Silly girl,

428
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,320
you don't understand the workplace.

429
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,239
Let's get going.

430
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,320
Here,

431
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,800
the coffee you've been craving.

432
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,360
Give it a try.

433
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,320
Does it suit your taste?

434
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,640
I took your trainee

435
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,519
around the park this morning.

436
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,439
She's got a good sense for things.

437
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:47,919
This trip around the park

438
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,679
might actually help me

439
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,880
meet my target

440
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,279
of one new client this month.

441
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,199
Have you heard?

442
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,679
The higher-ups have started

443
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,919
investigating the dating loan issue.

444
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,199
I think

445
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,279
I've done a good job this time.

446
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:01,239
Shouldn't the bank

447
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,040
give me some recognition?

448
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,360
What good job?

449
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,400
I submitted the key evidence

450
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,360
that exposed

451
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,600
Qianliyuan's true nature.

452
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,840
They have no way to deny it.

453
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,759
Those

454
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:12,840
blank contracts

455
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,160
without even a seal,

456
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,519
you call that evidence?

457
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,880
Are you kidding me?

458
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,999
Looks like you're not convinced.

459
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,360
Your recordings

460
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,400
aren't that convincing either.

461
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,439
They just

462
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,320
fired the employee who attended to you,

463
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,880
saying the person

464
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,080
doesn't exist in the company.

465
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,719
What can you do?

466
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,880
But you did contribute,

467
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,840
so I'll put in a good word for you.

468
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,640
Don't forget to drink the coffee.

469
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,199
Xiaoning,

470
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,999
don't worry,

471
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,120
I'll also say good things

472
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,360
to Mr. Ji for you.

473
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,160
Hey, that's my trainee.

474
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,279
I'm talking about the

475
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,360
investigation of the dating loan issue.

476
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,160
Even though I submitted

477
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
the key evidence...

478
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,239
Jing.

479
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:55,959
Go ahead.

480
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,800
Okay.

481
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,439
Sorry, Fanggang.

482
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,840
Even though I

483
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,560
submitted the key evidence,

484
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,919
you were involved too.

485
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,320
When Mr. Ji asks,

486
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,519
I'll highlight

487
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,439
your contribution.

488
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,560
Unlocked.

489
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:13,519
I'm back.

490
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,840
Welcome back.

491
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,279
Your wound isn't healed yet,

492
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,679
and you're already eager to cook?

493
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,080
This little wound is nothing.

494
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,759
Go wash your hands.

495
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:23,679
Dinner is ready.

496
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,279
Sweet and sour pork?

497
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,439
You know how to make this?

498
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:33,800
Just in time.

499
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,320
Try it and see if it's to your taste.

500
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,199
Okay.

501
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,320
How is it?

502
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,279
Delicious,

503
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,560
very authentic.

504
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:49,160
Did you make it

505
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,719
because I like

506
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:51,759
sweet and sour pork?

507
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:52,840
It's a coincidence;

508
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,959
it just happens to be a dish you love.

509
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,919
What do you like to eat?

510
00:20:59,199 --> 00:20:59,999
I'll remember it

511
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,320
and return the favor next time.

512
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,759
Peaches are not okay for me.

513
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,759
Then, I'm not picky.

514
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,239
Gao?

515
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,519
My scam issue

516
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,320
is sorted out.

517
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,120
If you hadn't called and reminded me

518
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,800
to negotiate with Qianliyuan,

519
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,120
I'd have lost my money

520
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,080
if they went bankrupt.

521
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,040
Anyway,

522
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,439
thank you so much.

523
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,320
No need to thank me.

524
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,560
If you run into similar problems,

525
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,400
feel free to ask me,

526
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,999
anytime.

527
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,519
Last time,

528
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,679
I was too emotional

529
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:30,160
and hurt Mr. Ji.

530
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,959
I wanna apologize to him.

531
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,479
Don't worry about it.

532
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,679
Mr. Ji is

533
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,640
very understanding;

534
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,880
he won't hold it against you.

535
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,080
Oh,

536
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,999
and Mr. Zhao

537
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,999
called to comfort me

538
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,080
and helped me with some personal issues.

539
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,679
Please thank him for me too.

540
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:47,840
Sure,

541
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,840
I'll thank him for you.

542
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,360
Great, thank you very much.

543
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,679
Bye.

544
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,160
Bye.

545
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,479
That was Gao.

546
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,199
He said...

547
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,320
He got his money back,

548
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,719
and Zhao Fanggang

549
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
helped him a lot.

550
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,719
He also wanted to apologize to me.

551
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,679
Is my phone's soundproofing that bad?

552
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,320
Did you

553
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,560
already know this

554
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,519
from meeting

555
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,679
or calling him?

556
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:08,880
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,719
I thought it'd be better for you to

558
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,080
hear those words of gratitude directly,

559
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:13,439
right?

560
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,679
Of course, it makes me happier.

561
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,439
But

562
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:18,719
not just because of his issue;

563
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:19,800
mainly because

564
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,679
our section one

565
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,959
has finally

566
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,959
weathered this storm.

567
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,199
Fanggang worked so hard

568
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,080
to resolve everything smoothly,

569
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:29,800
so now

570
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,840
we don't have to work

571
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,640
with our hearts in our throats anymore.

572
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,360
Let's eat while it's hot.

573
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,439
The bank has thoroughly investigated

574
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,360
the Qianliyuan issue

575
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:52,400
and reviewed

576
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,199
other similar

577
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:54,919
consumer loans.

578
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,439
Good job, everyone.

579
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,560
The dating loan issue

580
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,840
was handled in a timely manner,

581
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,120
especially thanks to Ms. Rao,

582
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,120
who played a very positive role,

583
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,919
setting an example for all of us.

584
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,239
Now, I'll announce

585
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,439
the handling results

586
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,160
of this incident.

587
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,999
On behalf of section one, I'm announcing

588
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,519
a full department criticism

589
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,560
of the person in charge

590
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
of the dating loan,

591
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:25,400
Mr. Zhao Fanggang.

592
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,080
His bonus for this month

593
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,400
will be reduced by 30%,

594
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:29,439
and

595
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,400
5 clients will be reassigned.

596
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,479
Criticism, reassignment, and a pay cut?

597
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,600
What's the meaning of this?

598
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,640
Can you explain it to me?

599
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,679
I've made myself clear;

600
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:43,840
no explanation is needed.

601
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,800
You know that Mr. Jiang

602
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,880
spearheaded the

603
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,800
dating loan issue, right?

604
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,800
And you asked me

605
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,880
to investigate it without hesitation.

606
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,919
That's a fact, right?

607
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,320
I don't expect any commendation,

608
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,560
but I don't understand

609
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,320
why you're doing this to me

610
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,679
in a public meeting.

611
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:55,999
I need an explanation.

612
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:57,439
You didn't

613
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,120
start this shebang.

614
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,600
But you're the agent.

615
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,360
I don't think this report

616
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:03,479
is too much.

617
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,679
What?

618
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:05,840
Mr. Ji.

619
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
It doesn't make sense.

620
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,600
I was an agent, yes.

621
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,080
But I have solved the problem.

622
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:11,560
I've cleaned up the mess.

623
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,679
I just got

624
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:13,479
involved into it.

625
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,519
I've done far more than I should

626
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,160
to make up for my mistakes!

627
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,279
Got involved?

628
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,919
You're not the only one.

629
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,120
It's the whole section.

630
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,320
Fine.

631
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,679
I can see it.

632
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,919
You're determined

633
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:29,999
to blame me

634
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:30,919
for all of this.

635
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,199
The act on the meeting

636
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,439
was for you to embarrass me

637
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,640
and set me on fire,

638
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:36,239
so you can let

639
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,800
the whole section to see

640
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,959
who the boss is.

641
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,959
All those angry scenes

642
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,279
were all for this purpose, aren't they?

643
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,800
If you have any complaints

644
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
about me,

645
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,120
just take it up to the higher-ups.

646
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,199
How dare I?

647
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,719
Today I'm just reported.

648
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,719
Tomorrow I can be

649
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,560
fired by you.

650
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,519
But don't you forget.

651
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,080
I've got

652
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,279
a thing or two

653
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,199
to be in this department

654
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,840
for almost 8 years.

655
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,840
We're colleagues.

656
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,400
We have to work together.

657
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,360
You'll see

658
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,239
what I've got.

659
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:28,600
Here.

660
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,160
Let's raise our glasses to Fanggang.

661
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,279
Come on!

662
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,239
Fanggang.

663
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,600
Your patience and forgiveness

664
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:33,999
can only lead to

665
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,239
his shamelessness.

666
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:35,959
I'm sorry for you.

667
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,199
Fanggang.

668
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:45,999
I'm useless.

669
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,080
Xiaoning.

670
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm such a wimp.

671
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,759
I let him bully me as he please.

672
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,040
I've lost my face.

673
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,679
Sometimes,

674
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,439
especially at this moment...

675
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,519
A man cannot give in

676
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,479
and be a joke.

677
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,400
I know.

678
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,759
I was a joke today.

679
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,999
No. Of course not.

680
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,840
This one

681
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,919
is on me.

682
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,040
I'll order more.

683
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,439
Okay. Thanks.

684
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:05,999
Just do it!

685
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:06,560
Thank you.

686
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,360
Waiter!

687
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,600
Sir.

688
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:11,919
Do you have a group price?

689
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,279
Sorry, we don't.

690
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,080
But we have a discount

691
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,479
on cocktails.

692
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,239
50% for 3 rounds or more.

693
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,279
It's a great deal.

694
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,239
Give me 3.

695
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:23,959
Okay.

696
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,400
Everybody!

697
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,919
Today,

698
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,479
let's have some fine cocktail!

699
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,080
B-52!

700
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,919
Three rounds!

701
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,320
You're so nice!

702
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,640
Fanggang.

703
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,160
Drink it up!

704
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:35,640
Come on!

705
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,080
Drink it up!

706
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:38,800
Okay!

707
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:39,640
Help yourselves!

708
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,199
Drink straight from the bottle!

709
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,679
Hello, mom.

710
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,439
What's up?

711
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,360
Xiaoning.

712
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,279
Where are you now?

713
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,519
I'm out at a party with coworkers.

714
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:53,600
Why asking?

715
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:54,519
It's the day

716
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,199
Ji's mom completed her therapy.

717
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:57,880
Don't you go visit her in hospital?

718
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,560
How did you know it?

719
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,160
She knew I've been looking forward

720
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,120
to visiting her.

721
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,160
So she told me it's her day

722
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,479
she ended her therapy.

723
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,080
How about this?

724
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,919
I'll go to the hospital now.

725
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,999
See you there later.

726
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,759
Okay.

727
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,040
Okay. Bye.

728
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,560
Is that Rao Jing?

729
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,679
The one in red.

730
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,600
Is that Jing?

731
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,439
Exactly!

732
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,239
It's not the same guy

733
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,759
at Qianliyuan?

734
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,040
Fanggang.

735
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,479
Sorry, but I gotta go.

736
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,040
I have a relative in hospital.

737
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,880
Sorry about that.

738
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm off now.

739
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,919
Okay.

740
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,600
Bye.

741
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:52,880
Be careful!

742
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,600
Take care.

743
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,719
Jing's a good dancer.

744
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:02,479
My god.

745
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:09,919
Here.

746
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,640
You just finished your work,

747
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,360
and you have to come to see me.

748
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,439
It's okay, ma'am.

749
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:28,519
Mom.

750
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,600
Mom.

751
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,120
I'll handle this.

752
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,999
You've got bruises.

753
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,360
Xiaoning.

754
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,279
Is Yuheng

755
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,640
too boring for you?

756
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,199
No.

757
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,439
Let me tell you.

758
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:01,999
He

759
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,999
tends to keep everything to himself.

760
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,199
If he pisses you off,

761
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,479
just tell him.

762
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,239
Don't sulk.

763
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,239
When a couple

764
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,519
stops to talk,

765
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,160
it'll harm their relationship.

766
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,160
There's

767
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
nothing bad between us.

768
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,999
Don't worry, mom.

769
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,959
You're already married,

770
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,560
why doesn't Xiaoning

771
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,919
have a ring on her finger?

772
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,519
Yuheng.

773
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,999
There's a gift box

774
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,519
in the bottom drawer of my

775
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,959
bedroom nightstand.

776
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,999
There's a pair of rings inside.

777
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,679
They're for you.

778
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,640
I should have

779
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,199
prepared a diamond ring

780
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,679
for you in advance.

781
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,360
You can pick one up

782
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,719
yourselves if you're free.

783
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,880
I'll pay the bill.

784
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,199
Actually,

785
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:01,880
I've been meaning to get you a present.

786
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,199
But

787
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,320
I don't know if you like bracelets

788
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,519
or necklaces.

789
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:10,519
I didn't dare rush Yuheng to ask.

790
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,080
No, mom.

791
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,160
I don't need these.

792
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:16,679
Mom.

793
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Immunotherapy

794
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,880
is pretty long this time.

795
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
How are you feeling?

796
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,919
I'm feeling better.

797
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,320
I was just thinking

798
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,479
about telling you

799
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,519
I'd like to

800
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:30,759
go home

801
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,719
for a while.

802
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:33,519
Is that okay?

803
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,439
Yes.

804
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,040
You're welcome to come back.

805
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,600
Later, I'll vacate my room...

806
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:40,360
No,

807
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,919
our room,

808
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,919
for you,

809
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,880
okay?

810
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay.

811
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:50,999
Why did you call me out?

812
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:53,160
So it's about Zhao Fanggang.

813
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
You're unhappy

814
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,560
with my decision.

815
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,160
One month's bonus

816
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,320
and five clients.

817
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,640
The loss is not much of a punishment.

818
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:06,120
"Not much"?

819
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,719
If your leader give you such a

820
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,880
big punishment for no reason...

821
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,320
Wait,

822
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
for no reason?

823
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:12,999
Zhao Fanggang

824
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,919
knows well

825
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,719
right from wrong.

826
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,040
But you did it

827
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,360
in an inappropriate way.

828
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:18,800
You gave him

829
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,360
such a big punishment

830
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,279
without a explain.

831
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,679
It's like you're using him

832
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,239
to intimidate us.

833
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:23,840
Right.

834
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,199
I see.

835
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,279
So in your mind

836
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,439
you feel that

837
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:29,199
I'm not handling this

838
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:29,800
in a delicate way

839
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,719
for him.

840
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:31,759
Xiaoning.

841
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,400
I do my job

842
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,400
with efficiency.

843
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,239
How can I be efficient

844
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,320
if I have to consider

845
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,239
everyone's feelings

846
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,600
and emotions in everything?

847
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,719
So you don't think

848
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
you did anything wrong,

849
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,320
do you?

850
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:45,600
Right.

851
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,360
You're so careful with your words.

852
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:47,759
We don't deserve

853
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,120
any explain from you

854
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,759
about what's

855
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,800
on your mind.

856
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,320
As for what's on our mind,

857
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,439
you don't care at all.

858
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,919
Of course I didn't mean that.

859
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,959
You can't...

860
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:56,400
I can't do what?

861
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,080
Make it personal?

862
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,719
Mr. Ji.

863
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
I've learned my lesson today.

864
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,600
I didn't know

865
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,360
anything about you.

866
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:09,759
I think we're getting

867
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,320
kind of emotional.

868
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,040
We better calm down now.

869
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,479
Stop arguing.

870
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,040
Isn't that the couple?

871
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:19,800
Yes.

872
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Why does it look like an argument?

873
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,719
It is an argument.

874
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,120
Why are you so nervous?

875
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,320
They are still young.

876
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,519
Isn't an argument normal?

877
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,479
What about us now?

878
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,679
What do you mean?

879
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,279
We made an appointment

880
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,160
with them to take us

881
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,959
to the in-law.

882
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,880
Now they're fighting

883
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,959
and taking

884
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,800
leaves.

885
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,160
It's okay.

886
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,919
We can go there

887
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,719
ourselves.

888
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,479
Is that proper?

889
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,239
Of course it is.

890
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,160
Besides, we've already

891
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,040
prepared the gifts

892
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,800
for the in-law.

893
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,160
Let's go now.

894
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:58,719
Actually

895
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,919
we've been

896
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,360
wanting to see you for a long time.

897
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,239
But we've heard that you're not

898
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,400
well enough to meet people,

899
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:05,479
and that you've been

900
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,360
undergoing treatment lately.

901
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,880
Don't worry.

902
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,719
The treatment was pretty good.

903
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,080
Yes.

904
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,759
You're looking very well.

905
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,360
Thank you.

906
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,439
Well,

907
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,919
I'm so flattered that you come

908
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,400
all the way here.

909
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,279
It's okay.

910
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,560
If it wasn't

911
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,719
my illness,

912
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:26,120
I should have seen you

913
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,959
before the kids got married.

914
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,519
It's alright.

915
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,040
Mr. and Mrs. Tu,

916
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,160
Yuheng has been

917
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
an introvert

918
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,479
since he was a kid.

919
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,600
He's not good at words

920
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,679
and kind of oblivious.

921
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,279
If he does something

922
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,120
that may upset you,

923
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,239
I apologize for him.

924
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:50,199
Please forgive him.

925
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,040
It's okay.

926
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Yuheng is a very

927
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,999
good boy.

928
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:53,519
Yeah.

929
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:55,600
We can tell

930
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,719
he's well-educated.

931
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,199
Must be well-taught by his family.

932
00:33:59,239 --> 00:33:59,800
He's a gentleman.

933
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,759
Yes.

934
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,919
That's a relief.

935
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,199
But,

936
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,199
I'm still worried

937
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,640
that they may not

938
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:13,199
get used to

939
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,080
their marriage life.

940
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,480
I heard it

941
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,839
when Xiaoning

942
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,199
blurted out that

943
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,279
they don't

944
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:29,839
sleep in the same room.

945
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,920
Try this one.

946
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,719
So fresh.

947
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,520
This vegetable

948
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,120
at this time

949
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,319
is the freshest.

950
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:43,600
Alright.

951
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,879
Help yourself.

952
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,759
Why did you come back alone?

953
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,839
What about Yuheng?

954
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,440
He's busy.

955
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,399
He's a leader.

956
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,560
Of course he's busy.

957
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
You don't have to serve him.

958
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,839
Leave some for yourself.

959
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,520
Have some soup.

960
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,279
It's good for you.

961
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,719
Well,

962
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,879
I've just changed your

963
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,879
bedspread and comforter

964
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,000
in your room.

965
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,480
Why don't you stay over tonight?

966
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:08,960
Stay over?

967
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,279
What about...

968
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,120
The room is good enough...

969
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,040
Right?

970
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,120
I've cleaned it up already.

971
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:17,600
Yeah, I see.

972
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,279
The bedroom

973
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,679
is lovely after your mom's

974
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,359
cleaning,

975
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,279
innit?

976
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:23,160
You haven't stayed here

977
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,359
since you got married.

978
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,679
The room's getting lonely.

979
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,160
Stay over for a night.

980
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,279
You can keep your mom company.

981
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,920
Mom, if you don't want me to go,

982
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,600
I'll stay home a few more days.

983
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,520
Okay!

984
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,440
Sweet and spicy shredded pork.

985
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,160
You have to try this one.

986
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:35,719
I tell you.

987
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,600
Your dad cooked it.

988
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,160
He just learned.

989
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,279
He said it should be good.

990
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,080
He made this the first time.

991
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,120
You have to try it.

992
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:43,160
She's asleep?

993
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:47,920
I thought you'd planned to

994
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,560
get them here

995
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,120
to appease them

996
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,160
and stop their argument.

997
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:54,120
That's what I've planned.

998
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,520
But now,

999
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,799
Xiaoning came back alone

1000
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:57,600
without Yuheng.

1001
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:58,679
That means,

1002
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,160
she's unwilling to stay with him.

1003
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Give her some room and time.

1004
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,239
It's not the argument

1005
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,319
but the silence

1006
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:07,600
that harms the marriage.

1007
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,799
Don't worry.

1008
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,480
Yuheng is a man.

1009
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
If he didn't try to solve it first,

1010
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,960
why would our daughter be expected

1011
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,640
to solve it?

1012
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,319
If they don't talk, they may separate.

1013
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:18,759
What if they get divorced

1014
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,319
on impulse?

1015
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,279
What are you thinking?

1016
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:23,199
"Get divorced"?

1017
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,719
Don't jinx it!

1018
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,359
Help me with it.

1019
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,239
Young people today

1020
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,480
don't value marriage

1021
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,839
as much as people did in the past.

1022
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:31,600
After the property is divided,

1023
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,440
and they

1024
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,480
are all single again.

1025
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,440
How about

1026
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,759
have some when it's not cold yet.

1027
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,239
Meeting with you

1028
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,600
is already traitorous enough.

1029
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:16,920
If I eat your food,

1030
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,640
I'll be guilty of accepting a bribe.

1031
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,879
Don't get me wrong.

1032
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm not trying to bribe you.

1033
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,239
I...

1034
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,000
You know me and Xiaoning.

1035
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:31,719
I

1036
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,000
just have something to ask you.

1037
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,040
What's she

1038
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,719
been thinking lately?

1039
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,199
You're in a relationship.

1040
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,960
You're the one that should be close to her.

1041
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:43,239
If you wanna know,

1042
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,080
just ask her yourself.

1043
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,359
But,

1044
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:46,759
if she's always

1045
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:47,759
this emotional,

1046
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,120
I can't know her true feelings

1047
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
under the emotions.

1048
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,480
Now we're talking.

1049
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:54,719
What's your question?

1050
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:58,560
You know

1051
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,000
she's been

1052
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,120
arguing with me

1053
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,160
because of what I did

1054
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,319
to Zhao Fanggang at work.

1055
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,960
And?

1056
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
I wanna know

1057
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:08,440
why she cared

1058
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,480
so much

1059
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,319
about him.

1060
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,120
Did you really think

1061
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,040
it's that Zhao

1062
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,719
she's been

1063
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,600
caring about?

1064
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,799
If not, then what?

1065
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:18,000
You didn't even know

1066
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,759
why she's mad at you.

1067
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
You deserve it if she dumped you.

1068
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,440
She may be angry.

1069
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,279
She may be disappointed.

1070
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:24,440
How could it be just

1071
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,759
because of a coworker?

1072
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,319
It must be because of

1073
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:28,000
your personality

1074
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,640
and the way you handle things.

1075
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:31,759
Still don't get it?

1076
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,160
All in all,

1077
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,319
you're making her feel very insecure.

1078
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,080
Feeling insecure?

1079
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,040
Yeah!

1080
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,279
Think about it.

1081
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,319
You're her leader,

1082
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,160
and more than

1083
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,440
that.

1084
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,160
What you do

1085
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,120
can impact greatly

1086
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,399
on her.

1087
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,359
You

1088
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,879
tried to establish authority.

1089
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:53,160
For any misunderstanding,

1090
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,600
you didn't explain at all.

1091
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,440
And you deal with

1092
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,879
Zhao Fanggang

1093
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:58,279
in your own hard way.

1094
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,480
All of these combined.

1095
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,960
Then,

1096
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,480
what would she think?

1097
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,239
If I were her,

1098
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,759
I'd think you're a

1099
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:08,120
stubborn, arrogant,

1100
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,719
and inconsiderate person,

1101
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,759
and hate that I chose a wrong man.

1102
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,759
I even wanna immediately dump you.

1103
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:15,679
C'mon, I...

1104
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,839
And the most important thing.

1105
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,239
You don't talk.

1106
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,359
It is the most

1107
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,199
deadly factor to any relationships.

1108
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,399
You get F minus

1109
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,399
on every move.

1110
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:30,040
Isn't it a bribe to you?

1111
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,160
It doesn't count.

1112
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,319
I'm helping Xiaoning

1113
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,239
with her relationship.

1114
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,679
It's my reward.

1115
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,759
Oh, yummy.

1116
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:47,239
Look at him.

1117
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,319
Your dad was so young

1118
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,239
at that time.

1119
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,839
We actually got married

1120
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,480
within a week

1121
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,199
after we met.

1122
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,080
It's our first time to be

1123
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,359
a wife

1124
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,839
or a husband.

1125
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,239
It's normal to feel uncomfortable.

1126
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,120
It's like

1127
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,600
someone just

1128
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,199
came into your life

1129
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,279
and

1130
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,080
disrupted

1131
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,239
your life.

1132
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,440
I remembered

1133
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,199
I'd like to be up early

1134
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,440
when I was young.

1135
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,600
But you dad loved to stay up late.

1136
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,160
We were not used to

1137
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,199
each other's routines.

1138
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,279
For the first three months,

1139
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,520
we didn't even have breakfast together.

1140
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,480
But I remember when I was in school,

1141
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:23,839
my dad used to get up in the morning

1142
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,920
and make me breakfast.

1143
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,040
We've been together for a long time.

1144
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
I made him to get up early by arguing.

1145
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,319
I can't imagine him

1146
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,759
daring to argue with you.

1147
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,239
For as long as

1148
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,239
I can remember,

1149
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,719
I think he has always been

1150
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,120
subservient to you.

1151
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,279
Every couple could fight.

1152
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:43,359
It's perfectly normal

1153
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,920
for couples to have conflicts

1154
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,239
or disagreements.

1155
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,879
The key is,

1156
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,879
they should try hard

1157
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,920
to solve the problems.

1158
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,799
What?

1159
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,640
You still don't wanna

1160
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,839
talk about you and Yuheng?

1161
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:08,799
I heard

1162
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,120
from Yuheng's mom that

1163
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:11,480
you two haven't been

1164
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:12,879
sleeping in the same room.

1165
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,199
Marriage is a great change in your life.

1166
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:19,359
It's okay that you

1167
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:20,799
haven't gotten used to it.

1168
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,520
You can

1169
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,440
improve it

1170
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,040
one step at a time.

1171
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,480
But you have to figure out

1172
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,679
what the problem

1173
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,080
is between you two.

1174
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,679
I just think we're moving

1175
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,000
too fast into a new

1176
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,839
stage of life.

1177
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,679
I'm afraid I'm not thinking clearly.

1178
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,799
Life consists of

1179
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,000
trivial things and numerous

1180
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,520
thoughts and feelings.

1181
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:51,799
There are things

1182
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,480
you may never figure out.

1183
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,399
I think that

1184
00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:56,920
if you have decided

1185
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,520
to spend your lives together,

1186
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,960
then you should try to

1187
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:01,199
make life as good as possible.

1188
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,920
If one day you feel

1189
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,359
you can't go on,

1190
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,679
then just break up.

1191
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:07,120
"Break up"?

1192
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,040
What's wrong with that?

1193
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,359
If you meet someone you love,

1194
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,399
then love again.

1195
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,120
If you don't,

1196
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:13,239
You can move back in

1197
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,279
with us,

1198
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:15,600
just like now.

1199
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,440
But

1200
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:23,040
I just don't think

1201
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:24,319
my daughter

1202
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,239
can give up

1203
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,199
or back down that easily.

1204
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,719
Mom.

1205
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,560
You're saying this

1206
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,719
to encourage me

1207
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,279
to keep going, right?

1208
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,160
You have

1209
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
the courage to go forward

1210
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,719
and safety net to retreat.

1211
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:43,279
Your father and I

1212
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,679
are your safety net.

1213
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:48,520
But if you wanna retreat,

1214
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,160
don't forget to

1215
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,120
pay your living expenses.

1216
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,199
You'll charge me for living here?

1217
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,040
You didn't charge me before!

1218
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,319
I'd like you to make it up to me.

1219
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,120
No!

1220
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:47,040
Sweet and sour pork?

1221
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:21,640
I can do this.
