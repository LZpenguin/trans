You Are My Secret EP11

3
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,920
Hi, Mr. Xu.

4
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,840
Mr. Ji

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,080
asked me to work under you.

6
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,959
I would

7
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,800
appreciate your guidance.

8
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,959
Oh, cool.

9
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,959
Then, um,

10
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,360
if you have any questions,

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,280
feel free to ask me.

12
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright.

13
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,560
So,

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,599
is there anything I can do?

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,160
I'm new, I'm eager to learn.

16
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,080
One sec.

17
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,759
Let me see.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,319
Well,

19
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,319
you can take these

20
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,959
and read them.

21
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,759
I'm always here

22
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,560
for your questions.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,360
OK.

24
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,400
I need to go to HR now.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,319
I'll be back later.

26
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:22,720
Alright.

27
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,440
In your face.

28
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,000
Xiaoning.

29
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,280
Hey.

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,799
We're colleagues again.

31
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,120
It is quite a coincidence.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,479
I didn't expect you

33
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,400
to come to our dept.

34
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,039
Because there are some

35
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,280
very important issues

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,680
that I need to finish in here.

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,079
By the way,

38
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:00,599
I heard that

39
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,799
you and Yuheng

40
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:02,879
are high school alumni.

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,919
Are you close?

42
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,599
We are alumni.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,960
Same grade,

44
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,199
but not in the same class.

45
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:10,879
Not very close.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,720
That's good.

47
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,879
Otherwise, like me,

48
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,000
I have to act distant with him

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,319
to avoid suspicion.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,319
It's quite bothering.

51
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,359
By the way,

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,240
for our office supplies and

53
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,639
the name tag,

54
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,520
are you the one who collects them?

55
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,520
Please get me a set too.

56
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,359
Why?

57
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,199
Back when we're working in the lobby,

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,919
it was

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,479
the ones on probation

60
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,160
running such stuff.

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,079
But now,

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,079
we're working for the BDD.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,919
I'm an assistant to account managers,

64
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:44,919
and so are you.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,319
Got it.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,919
Xiaoning,

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,319
try these plums

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,520
I just bought.

69
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,919
Feels like you're trying to

70
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,400
curry favor.

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,520
You

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
don't get along with Yuhui, right?

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,520
We are fine.

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,240
This is actually yummy.

75
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,440
I'd like to buy dinner tonight.

76
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,000
I've reserved a private room at Juchuan.

77
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,520
Please come and join me.

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
It would mean a lot to me!

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,479
Yuhui's got to have connections

80
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,160
with our boss.

81
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,999
Sure, smart guy.

82
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,439
You seem to know everything.

83
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,720
We'll head over now.

84
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:50,679
Alright, see you.

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,679
See you.

86
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,280
Take care, bye.

87
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:52,919
See you later.

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,880
Yuhui,

89
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:55,599
can you give me a ride later?

90
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,720
Xu Li, I'm kind of occupied now.

91
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:58,919
You guys go ahead.

92
00:04:59,119 --> 00:04:59,840
I'll catch up soon.

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,160
Alright, no worries.

94
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:02,400
Ms. Rao,

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,999
Mr. Zhao and I

96
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:04,880
didn't drive today.

97
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:06,280
Can we carpool with you?

98
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,119
Sorry,

99
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,520
I only let cute young guys

100
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,720
sit in my passenger seat.

101
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,840
You'll have to figure it out on your own.

102
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:12,400
Xiaoning,

103
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:12,919
follow me.

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,400
Go!

105
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,080
Rely on yourself rather than others.

106
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,280
Let's take the subway.

107
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:23,439
Sounds good.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,880
Wait for me.

109
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,320
No.

110
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:26,799
What's up, Yuhui?

111
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,880
Yuheng.

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,799
We are off.

113
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,280
They're heading to Juchuan.

114
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,160
Let's head out too.

115
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,520
They've already left?

116
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,640
I was specifically waiting for you.

117
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:37,320
OK.

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,080
By the way, Yuhui.

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,760
From now on,

120
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,880
just call me Mr. Ji at work.

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,320
OK.

122
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,200
Are you disinfecting the dishes?

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,599
Maybe I should disinfect you?

124
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,760
It's getting late.

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,720
Why haven't Mr. Ji and

126
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Tang Yuhui arrived yet?

127
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,119
Senior, junior,

128
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,080
a perfect pair.

129
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,720
They must be arriving together.

130
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,080
Is this the right place?

131
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:15,919
Yes, right.

132
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,400
Sorry.

133
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,999
Sorry, everyone.

134
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,200
The traffic was terrible.

135
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:21,200
We're late.

136
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,720
I'll sit here.

137
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,400
Then I'll sit over there.

138
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,119
Yuhui,

139
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,280
how about we switch seats?

140
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,200
This spot is right by the air vent.

141
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,679
I'm a bit under the weather.

142
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,280
Here.

143
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:42,679
Alright.

144
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:43,960
Mr. Zhao, come here.

145
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,239
So,

146
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,799
Yuheng,

147
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,320
everyone's here, shall we go?

148
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,999
Sure, just do it.

149
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:09,200
You go first.

150
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,080
Xiaoning has always been my senior.

151
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,799
Please.

152
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,200
Thanks.

153
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,919
Well, then,

154
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,280
I'd like to

155
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
propose a toast to all.

156
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,200
Back

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
when I was working in the lobby,

158
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,200
I achieved

159
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
some minor results,

160
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
but in section one,

161
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,559
I'm still a rookie.

162
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:35,880
So,

163
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
please

164
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
look out for me.

165
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,280
If you ever need anything from me,

166
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,080
just let me know.

167
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,960
Here's to everyone!

168
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,280
You and Mr. Ji

169
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,160
came from the same uni,

170
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
we'll definitely take care of you.

171
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,760
Actually, regarding Qingbei graduates,

172
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,520
most of us are finance majors.

173
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,080
In the finance industry,

174
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
speaking of Dairui,

175
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,359
there are about seven or eight

176
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,080
graduates after me working here.

177
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:02,439
Xu Li,

178
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:03,880
how about

179
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,479
looking out for them all?

180
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,720
Mr. Ji is absolutely right.

181
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,400
It's not fair to give Yuhui

182
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,479
preferential treatment

183
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,559
just for her relations with Mr. Ji.

184
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,760
It's a sign of disrespect for the skills

185
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,119
of graduates from an elite uni.

186
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:15,200
Besides,

187
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,880
no one makes it into section one

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,679
through connections.

189
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,280
Absolutely!

190
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,760
My bad!

191
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,160
Well,

192
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,239
I'll take a drink as punishment.

193
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,080
Xu Li, you're such a drinker.

194
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,799
Is one drink enough?

195
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,359
Make it a whole bottle.

196
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:26,559
Sounds good!

197
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,119
Mr. Zhao

198
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:27,880
you've got to join me.

199
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:29,520
Yuheng, please try this.

200
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,200
It's just-caught.

201
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,840
I specifically ordered it.

202
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,599
OK, thanks.

203
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,720
By the way, Xiaoning,

204
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,160
I noticed that the doctor from Renji

205
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,840
hasn't been around lately.

206
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,439
Are you two completely over?

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,760
It's OK.

208
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,079
How about this.

209
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:53,160
Just tell me

210
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,439
what your ideal type is.

211
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,400
I happen to know a few

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,559
really good guys.

213
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,760
Ideal type, huh?

214
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm into artsy types.

215
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,679
As for looks,

216
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:08,839
that's not a big deal.

217
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,439
I like shoulder-length hair.

218
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,120
What's important is that he keeps

219
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:14,959
a respectful distance from women.

220
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,679
Maintain clear boundaries.

221
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,959
I've got one.

222
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,160
My classmate's brother

223
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,959
fits that bill.

224
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,959
Next week,

225
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:26,679
I'll ask him out,

226
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,280
so you two can meet

227
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,039
and have a chat.

228
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:28,559
What do you think?

229
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,760
A blind date?

230
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,480
Sounds great!

231
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,799
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

232
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,400
It's a plan then.

233
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:36,799
Are you alright?

234
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,039
Thanks.

235
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:39,919
Yuheng,

236
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,280
are you...

237
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,959
What's your ideal type like?

238
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,400
Screw you.

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,520
Yuhui.

240
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:46,559
Here, here.

241
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,640
Take it easy, Li.

242
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,039
Alright, alright.

243
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,919
I'm not great with alcohol.

244
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,520
This place you chose is fantastic.

245
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,199
Good, huh?

246
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:53,799
So good.

247
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,360
I specially made a reservation in here.

248
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,880
It's really good.

249
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,319
Should I order some more?

250
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:55,959
We need to talk.

251
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:56,439
Good.

252
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,319
- Yuhui. - Ms. Rao.

253
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,079
- I'm going to the restroom. - Come on.

254
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:00,679
Let's have a drink.

255
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,880
Don't be afraid of any difficulties.

256
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,439
- OK. - I'm at your disposal.

257
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:03,400
I'll definitely help

258
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,120
if I can.

259
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,079
Thanks.

260
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,760
No problem.

261
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:06,559
Bottoms up!

262
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,360
Were you being serious?

263
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:17,559
What do you mean?

264
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:19,360
About your ideal type.

265
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,640
Were you being serious?

266
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,120
Doesn't everyone

267
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,760
have an ideal type?

268
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,880
What?

269
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,039
Can't I have one?

270
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,120
So you're going on a blind date?

271
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,600
Is that the reason

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,760
you called me out?

273
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,520
Let go of me.

274
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,039
Mr. Zhao is a man of pride.

275
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,799
With so many people around,

276
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,319
I shouldn't embarrass him.

277
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,559
Later on,

278
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll find a way to turn it down.

279
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,079
No need to wait or

280
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,600
look for an opportunity.

281
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,919
After dinner,

282
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:00,760
just tell him.

283
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,719
This is my own business.

284
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,600
I'll handle it myself.

285
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,679
Yuheng.

286
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,039
Yuheng,

287
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,079
are you in there?

288
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,039
Mr. Ji,

289
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,799
you should really focus on

290
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,880
your own issues.

291
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,160
Your sweet junior is looking for you.

292
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,280
How come

293
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,079
you came out from there?

294
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,559
I accidentally went to the wrong one.

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Let's go.

296
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,799
Yuheng,

297
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,400
back on campus, you mentioned

298
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
you liked girls with high ponytails.

299
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,079
What about now?

300
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,679
Ms. Rao, Ms. Rao!

301
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,360
Um,

302
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,679
Xiang and I

303
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,160
are going for another around.

304
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,280
Mr. Zhao didn't drive here.

305
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,520
Could you please give him a ride?

306
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,199
Me?

307
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,799
Yeah, yeah.

308
00:12:59,079 --> 00:12:59,679
Actually, I can't.

309
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,360
Listen up, my car

310
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,160
only accommodates good-looking guys.

311
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,240
You take him home.

312
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,959
Take him home, take him home.

313
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,319
Let's go, go.

314
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,600
Hey!

315
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,719
How could you puke on my car!

316
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:09,799
Xu Li.

317
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:11,000
Drive me home.

318
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,199
Wait a second!

319
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,919
Zhao Fanggang,

320
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,079
get off my car!

321
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,120
Rao Jing.

322
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,240
I'm really sorry,

323
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,799
but I can't drive you today.

324
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,760
Get off!

325
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,439
Now!

326
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,079
Listen, I'm serious.

327
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,079
I'll count to three.

328
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,160
3!

329
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,280
2!

330
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,959
Yuheng,

331
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:06,640
you had a couple shots.

332
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,640
Let me take you home.

333
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,120
No, it's fine.

334
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Usually, it's Xiaoning

335
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,799
who drives everyone home.

336
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,160
I'm really sorry,

337
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,280
but I'm heading to another direction.

338
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:16,199
See you, Mr. Ji.

339
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,360
Another direction?

340
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,719
Yuheng,

341
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,439
let's go.

342
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,719
I thought he had excellent tastes.

343
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:53,839
That his tastes were impeccable.

344
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,120
But it turns out, the dream girl

345
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,559
he's been longing for all these years

346
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,880
is actually someone like that.

347
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,360
Since she is so close,

348
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,199
why bother starting a relationship

349
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,719
with the intention of marriage?

350
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,600
His dream girl is taking him home.

351
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,280
He must be thrilled.

352
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm glad I caught up with you.

353
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,199
Why did you come here?

354
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,799
Didn't you drive?

355
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,000
Where's your car?

356
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
You didn't want to drive,

357
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,319
so I just Parked it at Juchuan.

358
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,480
The parking fees there are quite steep.

359
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,520
Such a waste.

360
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,600
But that's better than you being upset.

361
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,199
You're mad at me, right?

362
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,559
I'm not.

363
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,719
Who said I am mad?

364
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,000
If he really liked Tang Yuhui,

365
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,959
and I just asked him directly,

366
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,959
wouldn't that just be awkward?

367
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,959
I...

368
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,520
just got my period.

369
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,160
Feeling a bit emotional

370
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,280
is completely normal.

371
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,600
Are you in pain?

372
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,240
After we get back,

373
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,719
I'll make you some brown sugar ginger tea.

374
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,240
Sure.

375
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,319
Let me help you with that.

376
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,600
No, I'm fine.

377
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,000
You're clearly upset.

378
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,280
Can I ask you something?

379
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,319
What type of girl did you like

380
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,079
back in college?

381
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,799
Why the sudden curiosity?

382
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,039
If you don't want to answer, that's fine.

383
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,719
I didn't really have a specific type.

384
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,280
As long as it was her,

385
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,280
I was good with it.

386
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,839
That doesn't really tell me much.

387
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,360
Someone who is clear-headed,

388
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,480
cheerful and confident?

389
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,679
That sounds like

390
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,600
something from a job listing.

391
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Let me rephrase that.

392
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,480
The girl I like

393
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,439
has a high ponytail,

394
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,760
and when she smiles,

395
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,079
it's bright and refreshing.

396
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,360
High ponytail?

397
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,079
Well,

398
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,520
a lot of girls

399
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,079
have that.

400
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,760
Sorry!

401
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,319
It's OK.

402
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,039
It's all good.

403
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,000
Are you alright?

404
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:24,919
It's fine.

405
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,719
Let me check.

406
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,679
Just a bump.

407
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,840
No need to make a fuss about it.

408
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:33,759
OK,

409
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,160
I have a question for you too.

410
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,080
You mentioned earlier that artsy men

411
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:40,840
are your ideal type.

412
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,600
Is that true?

413
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,160
Just like you,

414
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,959
as long as it's him,

415
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,199
I'm good with it.

416
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:34,439
Xiaoning,

417
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,400
I made you some ginger tea.

418
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,479
Just put it there.

419
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,120
Thanks!

420
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,320
OK.

421
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:50,640
By the way,

422
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,120
is your forehead OK?

423
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,600
It's fine.

424
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,600
Just

425
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,880
a little bump, no biggie.

426
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,040
Alright.

427
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,800
If you're feeling unwell,

428
00:18:58,999 --> 00:18:59,600
just get some sleep.

429
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,360
Don't stay up too late.

430
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,160
Drink it while it's warm.

431
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,160
Do I look good with a ponytail?

432
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,640
When I smile,

433
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
is it bright and refreshing?

434
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,360
Are you alright?

435
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,919
Has your account been hacked?

436
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Artsy men...

437
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,679
Should I try my best

438
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,479
to become your ideal type?

439
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,719
You already are.

440
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,640
Hello, this is Dairui Bank.

441
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,959
Regarding the loan,

442
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm calling for a follow-up.

443
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:48,999
If you don't have time now, that's OK.

444
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,800
Once

445
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,040
you're done,

446
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,600
just let me know.

447
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,560
And then I'll call you back. OK?

448
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,360
Thank you.

449
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:13,840
What?

450
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:14,719
That's terrible.

451
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,600
You're terrible.

452
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,519
What happened?

453
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,239
Was it you

454
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:19,439
who left me on

455
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:20,479
the subway last night?

456
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,800
I ended up passing ten stops.

457
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,719
I've been nice to you all the time.

458
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,439
Xu Li,

459
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:25,800
that's really terrible.

460
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,880
Don't blame me.

461
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,439
Who should I blame?

462
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,719
Mr. Zhao,

463
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,719
now that we're on this subject,

464
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,279
then I have to

465
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,199
bring this up.

466
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,679
Yesterday, you're so persistent,

467
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,719
refusing to leave

468
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,320
my passenger seat.

469
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,600
You even threw up in my car.

470
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
It cost me 200 yuan to get it cleaned.

471
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,360
Gimme a transfer via WeChat.

472
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,759
Thanks.

473
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
So it was you...

474
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,840
What an evil witch!

475
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,360
Do you realize that

476
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,999
it's quite dangerous for boys

477
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:47,959
out there nowadays?

478
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:49,919
Boys?

479
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,959
You really overestimate

480
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,999
your own attractiveness.

481
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:53,919
You also underestimate

482
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,199
women's taste.

483
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:55,679
Mr. Zhao.

484
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,439
Rao Jing,

485
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
the wheel of fortune turns.

486
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,400
You'll be

487
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,199
in a tough spot because of me.

488
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:03,719
Sure, thank you,

489
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,560
just watch my gestures.

490
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,560
Tang Yuhui,

491
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,279
didn't come to work today?

492
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,040
She went to the

493
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
second phase of the Park

494
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,679
to visit a client with our boss.

495
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,400
Xiaoning,

496
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,840
you look worn out.

497
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,840
You must be exhausted.

498
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,479
Preparing for exams is tough,

499
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,880
but you still need to find a balance.

500
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,479
Make sure to freshen up after work.

501
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,560
I'll take you on a blind date.

502
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,439
A blind date?

503
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,800
I was just joking yesterday.

504
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,999
I not only have exams,

505
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:34,959
but need to find clients.

506
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:35,439
How would I find the time

507
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,479
to think about blind dates?

508
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,479
How about now?

509
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,560
I was busy reaching out

510
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,439
to the guy last night.

511
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:40,600
We can't just leave him hanging, right?

512
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,759
Yes, we can.

513
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:42,999
Don't feel pressured.

514
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,840
I'm gonna

515
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:45,719
be around.

516
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:46,679
After work,

517
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,400
make sure to freshen up.

518
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,919
Mr. Zhao.

519
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,840
Keep your distance from my apprentice.

520
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,199
The wheel of fortune turns...

521
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,999
A WeChat message wouldn't hurt, right?

522
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
This guy is so unreliable.

523
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,320
He didn't bother to tell us he'd be late.

524
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,840
He's already five minutes late.

525
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:32,999
Don't be upset.

526
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,120
When he gets here,

527
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,040
I'll have a serious talk with him.

528
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,160
I'm not angry, Mr. Zhao.

529
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Is it possible

530
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,519
that he has something going on?

531
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,519
Or maybe he just doesn't want to come?

532
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,479
But he's too embarrassed to say it.

533
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,759
How about this:

534
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,479
Let's go to another restaurant.

535
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,479
I'm buying.

536
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:47,840
Come on,

537
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,759
let's go to another place.

538
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:49,080
Oh, come on,

539
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,880
Xiaoning,

540
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,840
just ten more minutes.

541
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,519
When I was

542
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,320
talking to him on the phone yesterday,

543
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,080
he was very excited about this.

544
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,199
He must be

545
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:56,919
busy right now,

546
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:57,840
so he couldn't text me back.

547
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,840
Just ten more minutes.

548
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,880
If he doesn't show up,

549
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,320
dinner is on me.

550
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,400
It's OK, Mr. Zhao,

551
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,880
didn't we agree on this?

552
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,040
If there's something urgent,

553
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,199
he should at least give us a heads-up.

554
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,120
Let's go.

555
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,160
He just replied.

556
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,679
There was a minor accident on the road.

557
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,719
He'll definitely be here

558
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,439
within half an hour.

559
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:31,320
Mr. Ji?

560
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,519
Didn't he say

561
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,560
he wouldn't give any special treatment?

562
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,640
The good project

563
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,239
has still ended up

564
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,400
in the hands of his junior.

565
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,519
Why are you sitting back?

566
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,080
Didn't you mention

567
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,239
he will be here soon?

568
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,239
My date.

569
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:05,759
Alright, alright!

570
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
I'll send him a message right now,

571
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:07,840
asking him to double time.

572
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,919
Awesome.

573
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,239
Is it still to your liking?

574
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,560
This brown sugar rice cake

575
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,320
is really something.

576
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,160
Good, huh?

577
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,919
Mr. Ji himself

578
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,519
picked this restaurant.

579
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,239
His choice

580
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
is definitely reliable.

581
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,719
Your've got nice taste,

582
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:26,800
Mr. Ji.

583
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,080
As long as you're happy.

584
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,279
The flavor is quite nice.

585
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:29,959
Absolutely.

586
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:30,759
Let me tell you,

587
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,959
if our deal closed today,

588
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,759
the Park

589
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:34,840
would soon see a boost in income.

590
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,320
Mr. Ji, try this.

591
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm not really a fan of sweets.

592
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:38,719
Sweet, but not overwhelming.

593
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:40,919
Thanks.

594
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,360
You should try this.

595
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,959
This is their signature dish.

596
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,719
This flavor is indeed impressive.

597
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,479
I bet Xiaoning would love it too.

598
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,120
Please dig in.

599
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,279
OK, OK.

600
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:56,840
Thanks.

601
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:04,880
It's really good.

602
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,959
Have you tried this yet?

603
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,199
Have you tried this yet?

604
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:11,999
Excuse me.

605
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,080
Alright, I'll have a bite.

606
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,239
Hello.

607
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,999
Can I have a brown sugar rice cake

608
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,560
to go, please?

609
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,279
I'll pick it up when I leave.

610
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,199
Sure thing, sir.

611
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:25,800
Thank you.

612
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,719
I'm not just boasting.

613
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,199
This brother of my classmate's

614
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,080
is truly impressive.

615
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,040
In every aspect,

616
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,999
he's on par with our boss.

617
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,600
He not only perfectly matches

618
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,160
your ideal type of artsy man,

619
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,199
but most importantly,

620
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,999
he's quite chatty.

621
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:40,759
He'll chat you up

622
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:41,919
whenever he gets the chance.

623
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,719
He'll provide you

624
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,560
with plenty of emotional support.

625
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,999
If we put him out there,

626
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:46,840
who knows,

627
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,400
he might be more popular than our boss.

628
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,199
Is that so?

629
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,759
Mr. Ji.

630
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,400
Hey, boss,

631
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:57,840
what a coincidence!

632
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
I'm meeting the supervisors of the Park

633
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,800
for dinner to discuss business.

634
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
You were saying...

635
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,999
I was just chatting with Xiaoning.

636
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:07,840
I got a bit carried away.

637
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,759
I misspoke in the excitement.

638
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:09,560
Don't take those

639
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,400
silly words to heart.

640
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,400
They weren't silly at all.

641
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
I think Mr. Zhao has a point.

642
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,919
That guy sounds pretty good.

643
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:16,999
Send him a WeChat message,

644
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:17,719
telling him to take his time.

645
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,080
If he can't make it in half an hour,

646
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I'll wait for him for an hour.

647
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,919
Okie dokie.

648
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,479
If you two really hit it off,

649
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,560
you would have to invite me

650
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,360
to your wedding!

651
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,279
That's a given!

652
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,560
About that clothing company,

653
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,439
have the application documents

654
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,239
been revised yet?

655
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:35,840
Almost done.

656
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,840
I thought the deadline is next week?

657
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,360
You remembered wrong.

658
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,560
I meant this afternoon.

659
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,600
Not next week.

660
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,800
This afternoon.

661
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,719
The afternoon is almost over.

662
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:46,719
How about this:

663
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:47,519
I'll finish it by tomorrow

664
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:48,400
and definitely get it to you.

665
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:58,880
Boss,

666
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,040
as you can see,

667
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,239
I set Xiaoning up on a blind date.

668
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:02,840
Soon,

669
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,880
my classmate's brother will be here.

670
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,919
If I'm not around,

671
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:05,679
they'll just

672
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,120
feel very awkward.

673
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,160
I need to stick around

674
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,199
to help them out a bit.

675
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:10,999
They won't be awkward at all.

676
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,279
I'm here too, right?

677
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,880
When he gets here,

678
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,400
I'll help out.

679
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:16,959
You?

680
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:25,880
Xiaoning,

681
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:27,519
for us sales people,

682
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
the ability to handle cold calls is vital.

683
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:30,999
It's just a first meeting.

684
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:31,999
Just think of him as

685
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:32,759
a client.

686
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,840
Communicate more,

687
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,999
chat more, get familiar.

688
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,600
You'll be just fine.

689
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,120
I'll send you his WeChat

690
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,800
right away.

691
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm off now.

692
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,519
Mr. Zhao,

693
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:47,160
Mr. Zhao!

694
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:54,999
I'm just next door.

695
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,120
If anything comes up,

696
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,959
let me know.

697
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,040
Let me tell you both,

698
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
if we close this big deal today,

699
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,800
we expect at least 200 mil in revenue.

700
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,560
You both should go

701
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,759
and take a week off.

702
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,719
Good, good.

703
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:56,999
Thanks, boss!

704
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,479
Thank you, boss!

705
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,759
This time,

706
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,120
we owe it to Yuhui for making the link.

707
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:02,959
Are you still here?

708
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,040
Did that guy come?

709
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,439
The dishes are quite good too.

710
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,120
Have you tried the shrimps?

711
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,840
Yes,

712
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,800
yummy.

713
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,880
I'm going to the restroom.

714
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,999
Again?

715
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:21,919
Yuheng, you alright?

716
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:42,999
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

717
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,999
I didn't check my phone.

718
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
Looks like this guy isn't reliable.

719
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:58,999
It's been hours

720
00:30:58,999 --> 00:30:59,800
and he still hasn't shown up.

721
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,600
Why even bother with this blind date?

722
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,120
You can look out for your junior.

723
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,600
Why can't I go on a blind date?

724
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,679
These are irrelevant.

725
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,519
There's a company in the Park.

726
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:11,479
It's quite reputable.

727
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,120
Tang Yuhui took the initiative,

728
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,679
saying she has a connection with the boss.

729
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:15,800
That's why I brought her along.

730
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,560
Mr. Zhao also mentioned,

731
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,519
in our line of work,

732
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:19,919
networking is key.

733
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:20,600
That's why I came.

734
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,479
If you need,

735
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,600
I can help you build the future.

736
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,560
You don't need other people.

737
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,199
I've never expected

738
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,239
to rely on you for work.

739
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,279
I'm not just talking about work here.

740
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,439
You go ahead.

741
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,400
You should head back now.

742
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,999
She's worried sick.

743
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,479
Yuheng, are you alright?

744
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,160
I noticed you didn't look well.

745
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,880
Should I take you to the hospital?

746
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,400
It's al...

747
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,040
Hello?

748
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,239
I'm fine.

749
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,999
I'll be back shortly.

750
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:17,919
That's good to hear.

751
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,199
But, Yuheng,

752
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,919
they asked about the contract,

753
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:21,800
and I was worried I might mess it up.

754
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:23,719
OK.

755
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:24,999
I'll...

756
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:25,840
be right back.

757
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,880
Let's talk later at home.

758
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,239
I looked it up online.

759
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,640
During your period,

760
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
hormonal changes can happen,

761
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,439
which can lead to overthinking.

762
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,679
Just order something,

763
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,800
and I'll take care of the bill later.

764
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
I'll drive you home after I'm done.

765
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,999
Don't be upset.

766
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,160
I'd like to order.

767
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,840
Here's the menu, miss.

768
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,080
All done, finally.

769
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,199
Everything alright with Xiaoning?

770
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,120
Maybe I should check on her.

771
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,679
Here, use this card.

772
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,719
Here, here's a card for you.

773
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,479
You have one too.

774
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,239
It's not sufficient.

775
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,560
That should definitely cover it.

776
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,120
Rao Jing?

777
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,519
Take this one as well.

778
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,479
Take them all.

779
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,800
Just swipe it; it should have funds.

780
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:38,439
Ms. Rao.

781
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:39,840
Wakey, wakey.

782
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,560
I thought you're immune to alcohol.

783
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,080
Sir.

784
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,160
8,000 yuan?

785
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:53,439
How long did she drink?

786
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,239
Two hours.

787
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:55,600
She spent 8,000 in 2 hours?

788
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,040
Actually,

789
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,679
the cards this lady used

790
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,759
all show insufficient balance.

791
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,279
So,

792
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
I'm supposed to pay

793
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,080
for her drinks?

794
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,719
Since you two

795
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,640
are friends,

796
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,999
could you please...

797
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,519
No way.

798
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:17,959
Let go.

799
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,679
You should pay.

800
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,239
Let go!

801
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,360
Look at that guy,

802
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:23,959
clearly trying to avoid responsibility.

803
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:24,999
What a scum!

804
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:25,880
Yeah.

805
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,080
Obviously, he's a womanizer

806
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,440
and trying to abandon that girl.

807
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,319
Shame on him!

808
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,319
I shouldn't have come in.

809
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,040
Just scan my QR.

810
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,719
Make it fast.

811
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,759
So I could feel better.

812
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:45,160
I'm thirsty.

813
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:45,960
Thank you.

814
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,440
Give her a glass of water.

815
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,719
OK.

816
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,759
Give me one as well.

817
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,719
Take me home.

818
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,679
Your outfits are

819
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,759
all worth a fortune.

820
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,520
And,

821
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,319
just last quarter,

822
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,239
and the one before,

823
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,480
you received some juicy bonuses.

824
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:22,359
How come after a breakup,

825
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,679
you can't even afford to pay for drinks?

826
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:26,920
You talk too much!

827
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:28,679
Who broke up?

828
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,120
What breakup?

829
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,199
Yeah, sure.

830
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,520
The waiter

831
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,199
just told me

832
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,279
that the one who came in with you

833
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:36,440
was a young guy.

834
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,040
He went off on his own.

835
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,679
That's not my boyfriend.

836
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,600
Just a friend with benefits.

837
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,319
Alright, my apologies.

838
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,440
I really underestimated you before.

839
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,799
Keep all the booty calls

840
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,920
just to pass the time.

841
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,080
Have you considered this?

842
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,279
To them,

843
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,560
you're just a source of amusement too.

844
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,120
So, mutual amusement,

845
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,080
isn't that fantastic?

846
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,239
At least it keeps

847
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,920
loneliness at bay.

848
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,960
Zhao Fanggang.

849
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,199
I'm glad to have you around.

850
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:16,480
You argue with me every day.

851
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,359
That's funnier.

852
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,279
So here I am, working hard,

853
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:23,440
competing with you.

854
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm merely your

855
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
source of entertainment?

856
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,520
That hurts!

857
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,799
Zhao Fanggang,

858
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,319
I'll have you know,

859
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,879
being able to entertain me

860
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,120
is your greatest honor.

861
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,520
Yeah, sure,

862
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:44,839
would you take that

863
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:45,480
honor if you're me?

864
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,399
Last time,

865
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,719
you left me on the subway.

866
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:50,920
This time,

867
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:51,839
have a taste of your own medicine.

868
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,640
No way.

869
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,839
No, no.

870
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,279
Come here.

871
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:58,000
I'll give you my address.

872
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:13,879
Did you get that?

873
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,120
Are you really drunk or not?

874
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,040
When we get home,

875
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,679
you tell me.

876
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:42,520
Taxi!

877
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:44,080
Taxi!

878
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,080
Taxi!

879
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,000
I look forward to working with you.

880
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,480
OK.

881
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:49,440
See you then.

882
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:49,960
OK.

883
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,480
Bye.

884
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:51,040
Bye.

885
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,040
Take care.

886
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,440
Yuheng,

887
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,000
so,

888
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,279
I'll be leaving then.

889
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,359
Be safe.

890
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,000
Sure.

891
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,520
Ji Yuheng.

892
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,679
Am I just imagining?

893
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:12,080
But what if it is true?

894
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,719
And what if I

895
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,759
shatter your ideal image,

896
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,440
your hidden feelings?

897
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,759
Then how can we move forward?

898
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,799
Can we still keep this going?

899
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,679
You look silly when you smile.

900
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,040
Someone like Tang Yuhui

901
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:56,239
has to be Ji Yuheng's ideal type.

902
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,160
Xiaoning!

903
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:11,359
Door is locked.

904
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,239
Good night.

905
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:29,160
I need a break.

906
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,520
Sure.

907
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,560
You guys keep going.

908
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,719
Our top A student

909
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:32,920
is truly awesome today.

910
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,399
Do you think maybe his crush

911
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:35,960
is watching him in the audience?

912
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:37,719
His crush must be

913
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,480
someone really exceptional.

914
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,120
Yuheng,

915
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,440
what kind of girl do you like?

916
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,239
Someone with a high ponytail,

917
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,799
and refreshing smiles.

918
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,839
High ponytail!

919
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,319
He was talking about you!

920
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:23,920
He's so hot!
