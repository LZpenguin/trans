00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,560
Step aside.

4
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,400
Hello? Hi.

5
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
The second elevator

6
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
has stopped on the 29th floor.

7
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,400
It might be a technical malfunction

8
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,359
or a power outage.

9
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,440
Could you check it out?

10
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,799
[Okay, don't worry.]

11
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:41,319
[Stay safe.]

12
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:41,919
Okay.

13
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,879
Don't be scared.

14
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,199
Will you marry me?

15
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,960
[Right,]

16
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,400
have you decided today...

17
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,199
I haven't decided yet.

18
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,440
What I wanted to ask was that,

19
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,079
have you decided what's for lunch today?

20
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,160
My treat.

21
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,280
I... I'm a bit busy today.

22
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,079
I don't have time for lunch.

23
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,120
When I have some time,

24
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,879
I'll treat you.

25
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,840
Okay.

26
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,400
Let's get off.

27
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,280
Tu Xiaoning,

28
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,479
come to the meeting room with me.

29
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,879
She's only been here for a few days,

30
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,759
and now she has to leave.

31
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,960
What a pity!

32
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,879
Did you help Zhou Kai do the

33
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,240
commercial acceptance bill discounting.

34
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,199
Yes,

35
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,120
I did.

36
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,919
[Discounting commercial acceptance bills]

37
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,079
[require bank endorsement]

38
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,120
along with undeposited paper tax invoices

39
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,720
and bills.

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,560
[The bank has yet]

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,799
[to receive the tax invoices]

42
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,199
because Zhou Kai has conspired with

43
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,759
invoice dealers and fled with the money.

44
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:23,919
You handled the filing

45
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,000
as the secondary handler.

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
You need to assist in the investigation.

47
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,799
Manager Rao,

48
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,319
it was only a favour.

49
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:30,560
I swear I did not

50
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,599
collaborate with him.

51
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
Whether it was a favour or not

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
was none of my business.

53
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,199
We are in a work place,

54
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,039
not in a relationship.

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,240
[You don't need to swear your loyalty.]

56
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
Now many departments are looking for trouble

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
with the Business Development Department.

58
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,999
And you

59
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,799
have given them

60
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,239
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

61
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,640
So you mean,

62
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,479
I should take sole responsibility for it

63
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,599
and resign to

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,880
save the Business Development Department?

65
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,080
This does sound like

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,640
the most fitting option according

67
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,080
to the principle of economic cost.

68
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:55,999
Okay,

69
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,599
I understand.

70
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,280
I can resign,

71
00:04:59,599 --> 00:04:59,999
but I can't leave

72
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,400
while taking on such a big blame.

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,919
I will prove my innocence.

74
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,080
I'll head out now.

75
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
[The punishment doesn't fit the crime.]

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,160
Look

77
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,439
how far you've forced the poor girl

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,679
to go.

79

[When I had problems]

80

[at work,]

81
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:27,679
I never saw you being

82
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,080
this protective and caring.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,359
You're the iron lady of the banking world,

84
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,720
she's a delicate flower in a greenhouse.

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,320
[How can you compare that?]

86
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you really sure that

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,520
she could do it?

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,999
Of course I'm not sure!

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,400
But I believe

90
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,720
one can do great when pushed to the edge.

What a breakthrough you've achieved!

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,799
If she can indeed pull this off,

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,239
then it will silence all external doubts

96
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,760

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
[If she can't,]

98

then the Business Development Department

99

wouldn't be paying salary to

100

Killing two birds with one stone.

102
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,720
You're truly egoist.

103
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:11,760
Then how about I go

104
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
tell President Jiang

105
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,439
that next month manager Zhao

106
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,880
won't need his salary anymore.

107
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,439
We will get paid with love.

108
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,679
President asked you to go to his office.

109
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,439
What does he need me for?

110
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,520
The documents on illegal discounting by

111
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,679

113
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:30,999
did you see them?

114
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,359
Yes, I did.

115
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:33,919
The handler has run off,

116
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:34,960
and apparently,

117
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,999
the second handler

118
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,799
is a contractor, just a young girl.

119
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,119

[We need to investigate this thoroughly.]

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,200

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,359
to do things based only on

125
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,520
feelings and prejudices.

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,999
[It's not okay.]

127
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,200

128

we're alone here.

129

You can tell me in secret, did

130
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,960
you really not collaborate with Zhou Kai?

131
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,280
I know

132
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,080
you probably won't believe anything

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
that I say.

134
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,999
But I will find the proof,

135
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:25,840
to prove

136
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,400
that I didn't work together with him.

137
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,119
I told them that

138
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,239
Xiaoning wasn't someone like that.

139
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,039
But they didn't believe me.

140
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,840
Speaking of Zhou Kai,

141
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,919
I remembered something else.

142
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,919
He still owes me 500 yuan,

143
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:37,760
still hasn't given it to me yet.

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,359
[If you can get in touch with him,]

145
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,280
[let me know.]

00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:41,479
Okay.

147

Don't be too stressed,

Still here after work?

Let's go.

152
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,320
I'll head out first then.

[you have been working in this bank]

160
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,280
[for a long time now,]

161
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,640
[how can you not figure out]

[resources and connections are]

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:29,240
[I just think that]

165
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,919
[it should be fair.]

Fair?

167

Fair exists only in court,

176
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,520
and resign to save

177
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,880
the Business Development Department?

178
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,120
This does sound like

179
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,600
the most fitting option according

180
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,880
to the principle of economic cost.

181
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,679
[Hello,]

182
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,079
[the number you've dialed is turned off.]

183
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,120
[Sorry,]

184
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,880
[the number you've dialed is powered off.]

185
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:53,760
Tu Xiaoning.

186
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:00,559
Let's get married.

187
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:09,880
Nothing.

188
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,520
I once

189
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,400
heard a saying that

190
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:24,520
rain

191
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:26,600
is nature's fireworks,

192
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,799
[and the sound of raindrops]

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,199
[is like the bursting of fireworks.]

194
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,799
It was because of this saying

195
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,280
that I used to like it when it rained.

196
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,360
And then,

197
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,000
I realized that

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,039
the rain

199
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,280
would never turn into fireworks.

200
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,919
Instead, it will splash mud everywhere.

201
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,919
Thanks for the coffee.

202
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,160
It's very sweet.

203
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:57,839
I figured that you might

204
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,160
need something sweet in this moment.

205
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,120
So I added an extra piece of sugar

206
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,280
in the coffee.

207
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
I almost forget,

208
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
you work at the compliance department.

209
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:11,719
Did you know about my things

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
already?

211
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,280
Usually when old classmates meet up,

212
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,640
they either show off

213
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,760
their successful careers,

214
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:25,799
or

215
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,000
their

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,319
happy marriages.

217
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,439
I saw you a few times,

218
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,959
and have already completely shown my

219
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,079
failed life

220
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
from every possible perspective.

221
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,160
No way.

222
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,679
Unmarried at 27

223
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:41,919
is not a failure.

224
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,959
What about my job?

225
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,400
I worked in the lobby for three years.

226
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,160
If others are working hard,

227
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,919
I was pushing myself to the limit.

228
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,760
But even so, I still

229
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,839
wasn't converted to a permanent employee.

230
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,000
[Not only was I not converted permanent,]

231
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
[I was also assigned to the Business]

232
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,240
[Development Department, the so-called]

233
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,439
Ningguta of the company. [*Ningguta was a
remote, desolate area in ancient China.]

234
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,319
And the funniest thing is that

235
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,360
I won't even be able to stay

236
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,600
at the Business Development Department now.

237
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:10,480
My enthusiasm

238
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,719
is truly no less than that of a

239
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,679
permanent employee.

240
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,120
But mere enthusiasm is not enough.

241
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,799
If the problem is not solved,

242
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,719
you still will be laid off.

243
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,079
I know.

244
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
But I believe that

245
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,760
anything that has been done

246
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,839
will definitely leave a trace.

247
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,319
The reason I'm under suspicion now

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,919
is because

249
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,039
those traces

250
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,360
haven't been discovered yet.

251
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,079
But they must exist.

252
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,079
I believe I will find them.

253
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,600
So it's because of the meaning of

254
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,719
the work, and

255
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,600
the effort you've put in these three years

256
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,120
that you feel frustrated

257
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,079
and malcontent,

258
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,079
right?

259
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:00,679
Yes.

260
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,559
I knew it.

261
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,559
This is the

262
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,719
Tu Xiaoning that I

263
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,360
remembered,

264
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,280
who never gives up easily.

265
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,439
Are you using

266
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,400
reverse psychology on me?

267
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,079
It's so cliché!

268
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,199
But it does work,

269
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,880
doesn't it?

270
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:20,719
Yeah.

271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,319
Do you know how to solve the problem yet?

272
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,760
You work at the compliance department,

273
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,120
I am currently the subject of suspicion.

274
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,160
Maybe we shouldn't be

275
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,799
talking about this in private.

276
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,160
But I didn't

277
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,079
reveal any

278
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,919
compliance department's decisions to you.

279
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,919
But work is work,

280
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,799
and we still have

281
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,000
to follow the rules.

282
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,039
Keep going,

283
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:48,799
Tu Xiaoning.

284
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:52,919
It's my duty,

285
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,039
I won't be biased

286
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,360
when handling your problem.

287
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,880
Don't worry,

288
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,280
Ji Yuheng,

289
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,919
I won't leave the Business Development

290
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,360
Department so easily.

291
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,760
Cheers!

292
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,519
[Please sit.]

00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,880
Let's start.

294
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,400
Tu Xiaoning,

295
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,279
[now we need to]

296
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,400
investigate and examine you

297
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,040
regarding Zhou Kai's business issues.

298
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,840
As an employee at the bank,

299
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,560
you need to be accounted for

300
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,800
the authenticity of every sentence

301
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,160
and every word

302
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,800
that you are about to say.

303
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,279
[No concealment will be tolerated.]

304
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:01,880
[Do you understand?]

305
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,279
I understand.

306
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,679
Let me ask you the first question.

307
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,999
Did you assist in the two projects

308
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,160
that Zhou Kai was responsible for

309
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,279
the entire process?

310
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,759
No,

311
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,279
I was only responsible for

312
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,519
filing all the documents.

313
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,519
[Preliminary data collection]

[and information input]

315

on the office URL.

319

Moreover,

320
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,800
my chat history with Zhou Kai

321
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,080
can also prove what I said.

322
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,120
Here is

323
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,040
my proof.

324
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:37,999
Take a look at this.

325
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,999
Do you know what the exact performance

326
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,959
of a discounting transaction is?

327
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,080
No.

328
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,999
Then why did you help Zhou Kai

329
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:54,919
with these two transactions?

330
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Do you not care about

331
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,719
how your performance metrics is allocated

332
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,600
in these two projects?

333
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,560
Although I'm a customer manager assistant,

334

350
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,040
performance bonuses

351
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,999
or any funds

352
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,479
from unclear sources.

353
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,239
Do the things you mentioned above

354
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,679
involve any concealment?

355
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:31,999
No.

356
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,400
We knew more or less about the situation.

357
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,479
You can go back now.

358
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,239
Thanks.

359
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,199
I have another question.

360
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:49,840
The companies

361
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,560
didn't provide

362
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,919
any tax invoices at the time,

363
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,840
did you know that?

364
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:55,320
Yes.

365
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,320
According to our back's regulations on

366
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,840
discounting, if a company can't provide

367
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,759
the tax invoices at the moment,

368
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,600
and if in an urgent business situation,

369
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,999
they can provide it later within a month.

370
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,040
Zhou Kai is nowhere to be found now.

371
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,919
You were the one that did the filing,

372
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,600
so you were the second handler.

373
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
The bank is

374
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:11,679
highly concerned about this.

375
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,919
[Can you provide any]

376
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:13,759
other evidence?

377
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,239
[Don't panic,]

378
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,040
[there must be other traces.]

379
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,400
[Zhou Kai,]

380
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,679
[you don't have the tax invoices]

381
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:25,479
[for these two documents.]

382
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:26,479
[I know.]

383
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,840
[I'll ask them to provide it these days.]

384
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,199
[Okay, Zhou Kai.]

385
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:29,959
[But,]

386
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,199
[you need to sign]

387
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:31,959
[this commitment letter for me first.]

388
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,439
[Sure, I'll do it tomorrow.]

389
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,519
[I'm afraid that can be.]

390
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,519
[I can't do the filing if ]

391
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,719
[there are documents missing.]

392
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:37,959
[This is the rule of the bank.]

393
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,479
[If you can not come back,]

394
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,439
[I can bring it to you.]

395
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:42,640
I do have the proof.

396
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,040
Though the tax invoices are not complete,

397
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,600
the customer manager

398
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,919
must provide a tax invoice commitment,

399
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,080
[and]

400
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,840
[have it signed]

401
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,120
[by the heads of other departments.]

402
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,479
This tax invoice commitment

403
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,320
should now be

404
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:58,719
in the archive room.

405
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,120
Director,

406
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,880
I have no further questions.

407
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,519
You can go back now.

408
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,199
[Brovo!]

409
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,840
Jing,

410
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,560
I said I would prove my innocence.

411
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,959
Good, you didn't implicate

412
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,320
the Business Development Department.

413
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:50,919
Don't worry about her.

414
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:14,320
[Look at]

415
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,120
[what this is.]

416
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,360
Isn't this

417
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:21,239
from my

418
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,999
shopping cart?

419
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,360
As long as my friend likes it,

420
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,999
even if it's a pearl in the sky,

421
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
I will still find a way to get it.

422
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,880
This wasn't easy to buy.

423
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:31,080
Thank you.

424
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,360
Sure.

425
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,279
As long as you're happy.

426
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:38,800
Is it spicy?

427
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,439
It's good.

428
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,679
Maybe we should get married.

429
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,080
If we got married,

430
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,160
it would definitely last forever.

431
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,560
And we would be happier than

432
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,880
90% of the married couples in the world.

433
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,239
Sure,

434
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,040
quit your job first.

435
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,959
Don't be too stubborn to stay at Dairui.

436
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,679
For others, work is just work,

437
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,120
but for you,

438
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,919
it's like a series of ongoing challenges.

439
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,560
This time

440
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,919
was indeed

441
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,080
a bit dangerous.

442
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,279
But fortunately

443
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,519
I had some help.

444
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,519
From whom?

445
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,479
Your

446
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,640
ex classmate slash colleague?

447
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,279
Yes.

448
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,719
He gave me a heads-up before

449
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,320
to pay attention

450
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,519
to the details underneath the rules.

451
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,279
[And during the inquiry,]

452
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,040
[he appeared to be very strict,]

453
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,160
but in reality,

454
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,880
he asked a lot of about the

455
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,640
details that everyone else overlooked.

456
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,600
It not only cleared me of suspicion

457
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
but also showed people at Dairui

458
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,919
my professionalism.

459
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,600
He is outstanding,

460
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,239
meticulous and precise.

461
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,679
I think he's interested in you.

462
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,919
He proposed to me.

463
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,120
What?

464
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,560
He proposed to me.

465
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:45,759
Proposed?

466
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,279
Yeah.

467
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,120
Did you say yes?

468
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,040
Of course not.

469
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,400
I've only seen him a few times,

470
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,279
how can I marry him?

471
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,880
So what?

472
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,080
Why would someone as good as him

473
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,999
choose me?

474
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,040
It doesn't matter why he chooses you,

475
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,600
as long as you're clear on

476
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,479
why you choose him,

477
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,239
that's enough.

478
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,959
Someone like Ji Yuheng,

479
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,840
if you let him go,

480
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:02,160
he'll be snatched up in the

481
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,080
blind dating market.

482
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,120
Can't find another like him!

483
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,239
That's true.

484
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,759
With his qualities,

485
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:07,640
he's definitely

486
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:09,080
a catch.

487
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,560
And even though

488
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,679
we don't hang out often,

489
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,400
every time I'm with him,

490
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,959
I feel at ease.

491
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,400
You know each other inside out,

492
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,959
and fate even brought

493
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:19,999
you together

494
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,840
in a blind dating.

495
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,679
[Plus, he's asking you]

496
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,840
[to marry him.]

497
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:24,919
You are born

498
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,880
to be a couple.

499
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,479
Why not rush things a bit?

500
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:29,600
Think about Lu Sijing,

501
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,759
he ended up

502
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
with neither

503
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,439
a solid relationship

504
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,040
nor exciting love.

505
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,239
Yeah, that's true.

506
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,400
He

507
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,279
taught me a lesson.

508
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,439
Now I know that

509
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,840
time doesn't

510
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
always equal

511
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,080
a good marriage.

512
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,759
So, a flash marriage

513
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,919
could

514
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,199
still work out,

515
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:48,840
right?

516
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,840
Yeah.

517
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,439
From what you say,

518
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,479
he sounds

519
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,919
way better than

520
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,160
Lu Sijing,

521
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,279
even though

522
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,719
I haven't met him.

523
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,959

710
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:15,959
Breast cancer,

711
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:17,199
late stage.

712
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:20,800
Mom's

713
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
been through chemo.

714
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,919
Don't worry 'bout me.

715
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,959
We're all

716
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,120
in the same boat,

717
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,239
facing our struggles.

718
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,759
Thanks for not revealing

719
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,759
the truth to my mom.

720
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,759
She's just

721
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,919
afraid I'll be lonely,

722
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,400
so she...

723
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,400
Got a clue

724
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,160
why you're so

725
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,679
marriage-minded.

726
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:49,719
I get it.

727
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,400
But she seems

728
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,640
to know me.

729
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,919
You talked about me with her?

730
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,640
She's

731
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,080
just anxious

732
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,239
I'm still single.

733
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,759
We had a

734
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,880
class reunion, remember?

735
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:06,919
I told her I caught up

736
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,400
with an old school friend,

737
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,600
but she got the wrong idea.

738
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,080
Hello?

739
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,279
Hold on,

740
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm coming.

741
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,880
Thanks.

742
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
You've got things to do, huh?

743
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,840
Go ahead.

744
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,320
If you need anything,

745
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,999
just call me.

746
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,600
Thanks.

747
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,080
Mom.

748
00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:58,719
You're awake.

749
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,480
First time Xiaoning saw me,

750
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,960
and I was all sickly.

751
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,399
Must've scared her.

752
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,120
Nah.

753
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,040
Her work called,

754
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,279
she had to bail early.

755
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,359
When you're still at school,

756
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:24,520
you often talked about her.

757
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,960
Now that she's your girlfriend,

758
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,440
I finally got to meet her.

759
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
But I didn't even

760
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:42,399
have a proper gift for her.

761
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,560
Never mind.

762
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,080
Mom.

763
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,440
Xiaoning's cool about it.

764
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,879
I told her

765
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,160
you'd pick out

766
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,279
a gift for her soon.

767
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,560
She was very happy

768
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,879
after hearing that.

769
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,719
Really?

770
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,040
Yeah.

771
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,199
So,

772
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,040
you gotta get well soon.

773
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,120
Then we can pick out

774
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,480
the best gift

775
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,040
for her.

776
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah, gotta pick the best...

777
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,160
Xiaoning.

778
00:36:59,279 --> 00:36:59,920
You're still here?

779
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:23,399
Night market...

780
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,319
It's also called "Human Train",

781
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,960
where the food stays put,

782
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,440
we shuffle around.

783
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,399
You're not used to

784
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,279
this kinda place, are you?

785
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,160
Indulging in

786
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,199
snacks on a food street

787
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,440
without worrying about money?

788
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,000
That's every

789
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,279
broke uni kid's fantasy.

790
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,440
I'm totally fine with this place.

791
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,080
You sure?

792
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,600
Let's see.

793
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:44,960
Hi.

794
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,759
Two servings of stinky tofu.

795
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:47,560
Coming up.

796
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,399
Just alright.

797
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,080
Needs more frying time

798
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,319
for that crunchy skin.

799
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,359
And

800
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:03,399
the sauce's way too

801
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:04,399
watery and bland.

802
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:05,839
Our school's stinky tofu's the best.

803
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,839
Ours' the best.

804
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:08,560
Let's go.

805
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:09,199
The next.

806
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,520
I couldn't eat another mouthful.

807
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,199
I'm stuffed!

808
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,799
I'll grab you some

809
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:27,560
indigestion meds.

810
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,279
Nah.

811
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,719
Medicine

812
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:30,600
can't beat a good walk.

813
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:31,839
Come with me.

814
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,640
Why'd you wanna come here?

815
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,879
Just walking around,

816
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,080
thinking about

817
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,799
the good old college days

818
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,319
when life was simple,

819
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,000
we were stress-free

820
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,879
and had no

821
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:53,799
failed relationships.

822
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,839
I was eagerly looking forward

823
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,879
to graduation,

824
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,480
thinking I could

825
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,359
only do grown-up stuff then.

826
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,560
Me too. I was

827
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,600
hoping for an

828
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,160
inspiring job,

829
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
a happy marriage,

830
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,799
and

831
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,319
a bright future.

832
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:15,799
Sounds good.

833
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,679
Got a plan to make it happen?

834
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,120
I'll give it my all

835
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,480
in the Business

836
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:23,920
Development Department,

837
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,600
even though it's not

838
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:26,679
my first choice.

839
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,080
As for marriage,

840
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:31,839
I have seriously

841
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,440
considered your proposal.

842
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,560
Spending some time with you,

843
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,640
I think you're

844
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,520
a great choice

845
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,000
for

846
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,199
marriage.

847
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,480
But

848
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,839
I always have a question.

849
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,879
Why me?

850
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,040
Even if you're in a hurry,

851
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,359
you're good

852
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,160
and you could have anyone.

853
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:53,839
Why me?

854
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,600
Because you make me

855
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,799
feel right and

856
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,759
safe.

857
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,560
Yeah.

858
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,480
We're

859
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,399
on the same page a lot.

860
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,199
Maybe because we're classmates

861
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,560
and know each other

862
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
inside out.

863
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,319
Love is not

864
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,560
the only thing in marriage.

865
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,799
Comfort and stability count too.

866
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,480
You're right.

867
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,399
Keep your

868
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,000
expectations low

869
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,160
for marriage, and you'll

870
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,960
find joy in every day.

871
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,160
Low expectations,

872
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:37,359
easy happiness.

873
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,279
But my job's

874
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,399
a hot mess,

875
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,520
feels unfair to drag you into this.

876
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:46,839
Nah.

877
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,480
Career's just a slice,

878
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,239
marriage's

879
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:52,600
got more to it.

880
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:55,879
Look.

881
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,600
If we do

882
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,679
tie the knot,

883
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,560
imagine coming home

884
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,440
to find someone waiting,

885
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,640
watching a movie together,

886
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,560
brainstorming work woes,

887
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,239
and venting about

888
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,879
work and

889
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:09,719
bosses.

890
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,960
Isn't that sweet?

891
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,080
That

892
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,120
sounds good.

893
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,239
No rule says

894
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,440
you gotta

895
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:21,160
be rich

896
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,440
and famous

897
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,239
to get hitched.

898
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,199
My dream marriage

899
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,399
is one where

900
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,040
we have

901
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,440
high expectations for

902
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,239
our future life

903
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,799
and truly experience it.

904
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:36,640
Right.

905
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,799
Take the leap,

906
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,799
who knows,

907
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:41,839
the answers

908
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,040
might be waiting.

909
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,239
Ji Yuheng.

910
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,799
I've made up my mind.

911
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,560
Let's get married.

912
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,520
[Tomorrow.]

913
00:41:59,359 --> 00:41:59,640
Cool!

914
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:45,640
Yuheng.

915
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,239
Your dad's gone.

916
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,520
Just

917
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,199
us two now.

918
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:55,560
Word on the street

919
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,520
is your dad taking bribes,

920
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,239
and he died just like that.

921
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,160
Could've been

922
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,199
a guilty conscience.

923
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,120
With his dad's scandal,

924
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,480
no one's near him.

925
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,719
Hunk or not,

926
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,399
dad's a crook.

927
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,560
Rousong.

928
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:13,199
Rousong.

929
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,839
Hey.

930
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:25,239
Don't jump!

931
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,319
You okay?

932
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,960
The kitten's okay.

933
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,120
I mean,

934
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,040
are you okay?

935
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,480
Ji Yuheng, right?

936
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,600
I've heard

937
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
stuff about you,

938
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,600
not much detail,

939
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:56,000
[not sure if it's true.]

940
00:44:56,399 --> 00:44:57,960
But I wanna tell you,

941
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,920
focus on the future.

942
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:01,960
Looking back

943
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,600
only brings losses.

944
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,239
Keep moving forward,

945
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,239
you'll find

946
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,080
new things.

947
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,319
Don't forget

948
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:17,600
your umbrella on rainy days,

949
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,319
or you'll catch a cold.

950
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,359
Take care.

951
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:23,879
Here, take mine.

952
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,920
It'll help you get through this,

953
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:28,239
and the sun will shine again.

954
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,560
Take it.

955
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,679
Let's go.

956
00:45:42,279 --> 00:45:42,759
Bye.
