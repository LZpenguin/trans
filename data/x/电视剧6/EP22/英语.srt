[You Are My Secret]
[EP22]

3
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,599
I had an eraser

4
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,560
like this in high school.

5
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,959
Ji Yuheng likes

6
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,720
this type too?

7
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,680
That's so cute!

8
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,039
Maybe it belonged to his "ex".

9
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:42,440
You have a sore muscle?

10
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:44,240
Kind of.

11
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,280
I'll give you a massage.

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,799
It hurts here.

13
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,599
In my experience, massage works

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,039
when pain is felt.

15
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,079
Really?

16
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,520
What's your plan for tomorrow?

17
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,240
I haven't decided yet.

18
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,359
If you are free

19
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,199
tomorrow,

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,520
I have a favor to ask.

21
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,000
What is it?

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,599
I'm meeting a client tomorrow.

23
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,079
Can you go with me?

24
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:24,639
I feel confident

25
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,520
and will definitely make it

26
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:26,560
when you're around.

27
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,000
Isn't it inappropriate?

28
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,720
What's so inappropriate?

29
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,079
You're my husband.

30
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,840
Please, Mr. Ji.

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,319
Help me out.

32
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:40,799
Alright.

33
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,400
Is that a yes?

34
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:46,799
Here.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,720
Check it.

36
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,639
Longhu Glass?

37
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,440
I prefer

38
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,359
to stay

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,440
on the safe side.

40
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,079
Because we've

41
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,560
been through hard times.

42
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,919
We think money

43
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,319
is uneasy to earn.

44
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,199
[Yes.]

45
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,840
[We're trying to grow our company.]

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,359
[There are many banks that want to invest]

47
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,079
[in our company.]

48
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:17,599
But I turned them down.

49
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,479
I always feel that money

50
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,120
borrowed from the bank

51
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,520
is not my own.

52
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,079
[I'll have to pay it back with interest.]

53
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,039
[It's not a good deal.]

54
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,240
So I don't think your

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,039
proposal is safe enough.

56
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,919
[On this point,]

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,359
we both have the

58
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:33,919
same opinion.

59
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,599
When Xiaoning reached me,

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,760
I thought,

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,999
because we're from

62
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,320
the same hometown,

63
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,080
and it's not easy

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,200
for you guys in marketing,

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,080
I was thinking to

66
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:44,720
have a nice chat

67
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,280
together.

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
But we haven't

69
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,760
considered a loan seriously.

70
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
I know

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
what you mean.

72
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:54,359
And I certainly won't force you

73
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,400
to take out a loan.

74
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,999
It's an honor to

75
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,039
meet you both today.

76
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,160
Feel free to call me

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,320
for any future

78
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,599
banking needs.

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,520
[Okay.]

80
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,919
By the way, can you recommend

81
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,479
good financial products from your bank?

82
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,559
We can consider.

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,520
Sure.

84
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:10,559
We will do an evaluation based on

85
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,559
your pre-invested capital

86
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,880
and business operations,

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,919
and customize

88
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,880
a financial product

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
that works best for you.

90
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,479
You have customization services?

91
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,479
This might work.

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,880
[Please let us know]

93
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,160
[what we need to do]

94
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
[and what we]

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,119
[need to prepare.]

96
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,359
I'll

97
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,160
see you

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,400
after

99
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,559
the fair.

100
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,760
The wealth management department

101
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,280
of our bank is

102
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,999
at your service for it.

103
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,799
But, don't worry.

104
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,080
Xiaoning is also good at

105
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,919
the financial management business.

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
She'll be there.

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,799
Does it

108
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,880
go to

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,799
Xiaoning's

110
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,520
personal KPI?

111
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,039
You don't have to worry about me.

112
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,359
It's my duty to help you.

113
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,799
Mr. Liu.

114
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,239
I just came up and saw

115
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,160
the large

116
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,400
exhibition hall.

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
[I thought they were lessees doing marketing.]

118
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
[But you said it's a fair]

119
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,200
and you have your own brand?

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,359
Exactly.

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,200
[You haven't sorted it out yet.]

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,999
[We are the supplier,]

123
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,400
they are

124
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,080
channel agents.

125
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,679
They have to buy from us.

126
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,080
May I ask

127
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
how many days the fair will last

128
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,400
and what is

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,439
the turnover per day

130
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:12,919
for a fair

131
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:13,720
like this?

132
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
This is an

133
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,080
industry summit.

134
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,999
[It's all large quantity purchase orders.]

135
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:22,280
[It could be 30-40 million yuan]

136
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,280
[a day.]

137
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,239
More than that.

138
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,160
What are your

139
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,320
cashiering options?

140
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,119
[Cash.]

141
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,720
[Cards.]

142
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,520
[Alipay.]

143
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,919
By all means.

144
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,160
I have an idea

145
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,679
I'd like to share.

146
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,479
Yes?

147
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:41,880
How about working with our bank

148
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,799
to achieve your

149
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,999
promotional goals?

150
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,320
You can combine the promotional discount

151
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,479
with our bank card.

152
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,919
Discounts will be offered to

153
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:49,439
customers

154
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,679
who pay with our bank's

155
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,280
credit or

156
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,039
debit card

157
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,520
depending on

158
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
the amount spent.

159
00:06:59,439 --> 00:06:59,760
So,

160
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:02,239
what good would that do us?

161
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,039
Yeah.

162
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,200
Let me describe it from another aspect.

163
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,200
In this exhibition,

164
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,039
any money

165
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,999
settled with Dairui's card

166
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,080
will go into the

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,200
enterprise clearing account.

168
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,520
When the deposit

169
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,479
accumulates to five million yuan,

170
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,200
we'll offer the interest

171
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,280
in excess of

172
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,479
demand deposits.

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,039
For each increment of five million,

174
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,520
rate points can be added.

175
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,520
You see,

176
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:22,760
it's the same money.

177
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,160
If you put it in another bank,

178
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,439
you'd only get a demand deposit interest.

179
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,280
But if you put it at Dairui,

180
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,320
you can have a very

181
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,919
substantial incremental interest rate.

182
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:31,559
What do you say?

183
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,439
[Sounds good to me.]

184
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,880
It's worth a try.

185
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,160
Bro,

186
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,359
what do you think?

187
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,400
I think it's safer.

188
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,679
[If this is the case,]

189
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,999
tell me more about

190
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,280
the loan program you just said.

191
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,960
Maybe I'll give it a go.

192
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,400
Sure.

193
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,760
I didn't expect

194
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,520
you'd become so good

195
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
in a month.

196
00:07:58,999 --> 00:07:59,559
I thought

197
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,919
you'd be discouraged

198
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,799
when they

199
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,039
refused your offer in the first place.

200
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,160
Because you taught me well.

201
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:06,919
Marketing

202
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,119
and negotiation cannot be rushed.

203
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,599
We need to gather information

204
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,039
from talking to our clients,

205
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,559
then work on it.

206
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,160
Seriously,

207
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,799
that was a very clever proposal

208
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,679
you just made.

209
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,880
If this kind of

210
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,840
large quantity ordering can work

211
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,039
with our bank,

212
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,559
the average daily settlements

213
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,400
would be beyond our estimate.

214
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,080
[Also, that cardholder discount]

215
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,320
[is ingenious.]

216
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,799
This will

217
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,359
help us

218
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,439
get some more cards issued.

219
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,039
It's also an advertisement

220
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,160
for Dairui.

221
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,119
Many birds with one stone.

222
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,479
I guess it won't be long

223
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,320
before I have to

224
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,599
work for you.

225
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:43,919
But the final

226
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,160
decision is yours.

227
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,880
Whether it's 5 million yuan

228
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,799
or incremental interest.

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,039
You're the boss.

230
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,199
But thanks anyway.

231
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,199
What for?

232
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:00,959
Thank you for understanding

233
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,719
me so well.

234
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,439
In fact, I know

235
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:05,319
you're

236
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,160
capable

237
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,319
and sure of

238
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,880
making this work.

239
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
[But you keep finding excuses for me]

240
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,480
to get involved.

241
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,679
I know you want me to

242
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,000
get out of the shadows

243
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,360
and back to normal life.

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,160
Actually, I've had

245
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:23,559
enough rest.

246
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,600
I'm sure my mom

247
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,439
would have wanted me

248
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,480
to live and work well.

249
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,039
So it's time

250
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,319
to move on.

251
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,919
You worked so late yesterday.

252
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,439
Do you want to take a break?

253
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,760
Honestly,

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,280
last night

255
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,199
I was on the edge.

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I feel much more relaxed now.

257
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,160
It's over half an hour away.

258
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:56,679
You can take a nap.

259
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,719
Okay.

260
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,799
What a coincidence, Mr. Zhao.

261
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,880
You are here to...

262
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,000
Xiaoning.

263
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,039
Fanggang.

264
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,280
Mr. Ji is back.

265
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,480
Why do you have his case?

266
00:10:58,319 --> 00:10:59,439
We met at the elevator.

267
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,079
He went upstairs for the bank president.

268
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,319
So he let me bring the case here.

269
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,679
When I came along with him,

270
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,000
and he went to the president,

271
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,839
I offered to bring his case

272
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:11,600
back here,

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,719
and he never gave me,

274
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,520
like I'm an outsider.

275
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,079
You seem to be an insider.

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,480
It's just...

277
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
no big deal at all.

278
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:18,880
Maybe

279
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,559
he's in a good mood today.

280
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,280
It's common.

281
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,480
Maybe

282
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,280
he's busier than usual.

283
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,360
No.

284
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600
Don't you realize

285
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,280
he has a little bit of...

286
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
clean fetish on personal things?

287
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:39,919
[He never let]

288
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,600
[anyone in to clean]

289
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,959
[his office.]

290
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:43,799
 Well.

291
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,079
You've seemingly finished your KPI

292
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,400
for the month, aren't you?

293
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,480
You don't have better things to do?

294
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,439
You want to

295
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:49,240
talk about who takes

296
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,000
Mr. Ji's case

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
all day long?

298
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,360
And you.

299
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,400
You're a senior.

300
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,719
Don't do naive things

301
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:55,919
like this.

302
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,280
Yeah, I don't have better

303
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,480
things to do.

304
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,000
I only do things

305
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,679
lacking of consideration

306
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,600
and annoying.

307
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,360
Xiaoning, since you are here,

308
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,039
I have something about a client to ask.

309
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,839
Come with me.

310
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,400
Okay.

311
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,240
You went to see a client this afternoon?

312
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:18,919
How's it going?

313
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,400
They actually need a loan,

314
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,039
but it has to be better value.

315
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,079
They want a cooperation on the exhibition.

316
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,280
When we

317
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,880
go there and

318
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,640
open service,

319
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,280
we can also

320
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,039
promote our credit cards.

321
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
If you're successful

322
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,280
in this project,

323
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,559
you're one step closer to becoming

324
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,400
a permanent employee.

325
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,839
Congratulations.

326
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,959
Well,

327
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,400
don't congratulate me now.

328
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,199
Let's wait

329
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,199
until it's done.

330
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,520
I'm still scared about

331
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,319
what happened to Mr. Yang.

332
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,919
Xiaoning.

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,319
You're working pretty well

334
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:57,520
right now.

335
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,799
Why?

336
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,199
A woman should never

337
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,760
give up her career

338
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,839
for a relationship

339
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,959
especially don't

340
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,679
give up job

341
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,719
for men and romance.

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,039
So, no matter what happens,

343
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,839
you'll be able to walk away

344
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,039
and live alone.

345
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,120
Jing.

346
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,079
Mr. Ji an I...

347
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,360
You don't have to tell me.

348
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not interested in

349
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,039
what you're doing with him.

350
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,880
I just want to remind you that

351
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,079
since you have chosen him,

352
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:25,880
you have to be prepared

353
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,240
for you to resign once

354
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,400
your relationship comes into public.

355
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,839
Don't worry.

356
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,079
I'll try my best

357
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,000
to keep myself here.

358
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,280
He and I

359
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
have set the KPIs.

360
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,679
Whoever doesn't qualify them leaves.

361
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,319
A bet, huh?

362
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,679
Ji Yuheng is a fair man.

363
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
I'd like to ask

364
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,199
who has the upper hand,

365
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:49,919
based on the current KPIs?

366
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,880
Being a permanent employee

367
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,839
will be half way to my goal

368
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,039
of KPI.

369
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,199
As for his,

370
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
I don't know much.

371
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,199
He's very careful not to

372
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,400
reveal anything.

373
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,360
I wish you success

374
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,400
in advance.

375
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,959
Thanks.

376
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,400
No.

377
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
You must be the winner.

378
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,160
You're my pupil.

379
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:14,760
Even if you're up against

380
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,319
the current leader of Section 1 of BDD,

381
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,160
you have to win.

382
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:19,880
Come on.

383
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,319
Cheer up!

384
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,039
Cheer up!

385
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,280
Sir.

386
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,760
Yuheng.

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,480
Here.

388
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,760
Have a seat.

389
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,079
I thought you were

390
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,400
taking a few more days off.

391
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,600
I'm pretty well rested.

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,880
So I decided

393
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
to get back to work.

394
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,600
So what's your plan for the future?

395
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,719
After all, you agreed to

396
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,679
come here

397
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
because of your mother.

398
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,880
Don't worry, sir.

399
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,319
You told me you wanted

400
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,160
me to bring Section 1 of BDD

401
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,039
back to life.

402
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,240
I'll keep

403
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,480
my promise.

404
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,319
I also would like

405
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,919
my teammates

406
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,679
to have more opportunities.

407
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,360
More opportunities?

408
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,439
Recently, the government

409
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,039
has a deposit-only program.

410
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,360
If we're able

411
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,160
to take it,

412
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:08,760
maybe we'll

413
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,719
get a result for our

414
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
previous appointment.

415
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,600
And?

416
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,120
You're a man

417
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,079
who always think further.

418
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,240
There must be more

419
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:19,360
you have known.

420
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,799
You know me better than I do.

421
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:23,919
I've heard about

422
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:25,039
a new opportunity

423
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,000
in Dairui lately.

424
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,839
So I thought I'd come by

425
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,000
and try to get it.

426
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,120
We've all read

427
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,310
the bidding documents.

428
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,830
I'll sum it up.

429
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,790
It's a government

430
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,710
deposit-only program.

431
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,240
There are a dozen banks

432
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
that participated in the bidding process.

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,190
Two banks will be selected

434
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,710
based on their interest rates.

435
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,910
Compared to the targeted deposit

436
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,760
products of state-owned banks,

437
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,430
ours are simple

438
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,030
[and less competitive.]

439
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,400
I don't think so.

440
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,910
Dairui

441
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,790
has a lot of experience

442
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,790
with larger bids before.

443
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,790
If I remember correctly,

444
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,400
Ms. Rao,

445
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,550
you've done some of those projects.

446
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,710
Yeah, so?

447
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,030
Mr. Ji.

448
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,070
Can you give me

449
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,070
this task?

450
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,310
I can do this.

451
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,790
This is, after all,

452
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,950
government-related.

453
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,360
Better count on

454
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,400
Ms. Rao and Mr. Zhao

455
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,000
who

456
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,070
are more experienced.

457
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,910
The rest of us are also part of the effort

458
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
and will get fair share of it.

459
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm okay with it.

460
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,160
Right.

461
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,000
Then let's do our best.

462
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,880
Ms. Rao.

463
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,600
You're better

464
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,430
at bidding.

465
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,710
You take care

466
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,910
of the bid document.

467
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay.

468
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,480
Then I'll leave

469
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,240
the rest of works

470
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,400
to you.

471
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,670
Fine by me.

472
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,790
Can I help Jing

473
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,280
write the bid?

474
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,310
I want to learn.

475
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,670
Okay.

476
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,030
I can work on the data.

477
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm good at it.

478
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,000
It's my forte.

479
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,030
Good.

480
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,400
Then Tang will work with Xu Li

481
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,030
on the data.

482
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,000
What about me?

483
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,280
A cheer leader?

484
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,160
How about this?

485
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,310
I'll prepare bidder's information

486
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,950
for the bid with Yaos.

487
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,790
Alright.

488
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:11,910
Sir.

489
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,790
Consider it done.

490
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,160
Just prepare yourself

491
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,240
to sign the contract.

492
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,360
We work as one.

493
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,160
We can do this.

494
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,310
We can do this.

495
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,600
We're right in front.

496
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,360
No results yet?

497
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,710
How come you

498
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,320
don't have any inside info?

499
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,800
Mr. Ji.

500
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,430
We're going to work harder.

501
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,270
What do you mean?

502
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,080
A hundred million?

503
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,080
Eight hundred million?

504
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,320
We did it!

505
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:19,840
We did it.

506
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,080
A deposit of 8 hundred million.

507
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,560
It's a tough battle.

508
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,600
It's really tough.

509
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,470
Seriously.

510
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,190
[You're the soul of Section 1]

511
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,880
[of BDD.]

512
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,360
It's all your credit.

513
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,230
Don't let me take the credit.

514
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,750
You're the ones who made it.

515
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,040
Fanggang!

516
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,360
Hit me!

517
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,840
Stop.

518
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,880
[Mr. Ji, Fanggang.]

519
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,270
[We've been working]

520
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,270
[too hard.]

521
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,160
[I didn't expect]

522
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,990
[we'd be able to do it.]

523
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,230
[It's 8 hundred million!]

524
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:47,990
[Yeah.]

525
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,040
[It'll not only fulfill]

526
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,320
this quarter's target,

527
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,560
but even this year's.

528
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,880
We're blessed.

529
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,430
Xiaoning.

530
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,710
With a record like this, you're

531
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,230
definitely being a permanent employee!

532
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,230
Yeah!

533
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,470
[If the bank]

534
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,270
[doesn't think]

535
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,990
[it's enough,]

536
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,560
you can take

537
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,360
my performance

538
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,710
as yours.

539
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,800
But don't forget to return the favor.

540
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,230
She can do it herself

541
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:07,880
without your help.

542
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,510
Right?

543
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,230
[Okay.]

544
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,040
Listen.

545
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,840
Today,

546
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,910
I'll make an exception

547
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,270
to treat you all to dinner.

548
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,430
An extortionate one!

549
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,190
[Let's go!]

550
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
[Be my guest!]

551
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,120
I got my interview invitation.

552
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,880
Really?

553
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,670
You can do this.

554
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,080
Victory is in sight.

555
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,190
I know.

556
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:28,800
See you.

557
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,040
Congratulations!

558
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,560
Congratulations!

559
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,470
Check out the fireworks

560
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,990
we prepared for you.

561
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,800
Thank you.

562
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,270
Thank you all.

563
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,160
Okay.

564
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,840
You're done congratulating.

565
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,510
Go back

566
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,320
to your work.

567
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,360
Alright, alright.

568
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,990
Thanks, Fanggang.

569
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,360
Xiaoning.

570
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,400
I'll buy you

571
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,040
dinner.

572
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,400
Thank you.

573
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,320
Congratulations.

574
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,400
Why don't you tell your family?

575
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,430
Xiaoning.

576
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,400
You've got

577
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,230
a great family

578
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,190
and a great career now.

579
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,080
Keep going!

580
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,160
Tell them.

581
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,400
[I passed the interview.]

582
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,880
[I'm a permanent employee now!]

583
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,800
[I used to stand at]

584
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,430
[the crossroads of my 27th year]

585
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,040
[trying to hold on to]

586
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,080
[some sense of security.]

587
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,430
[Now I have made it.]

588
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,040
[Tu Xiaoning.]

589
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,600
[You're probably]

590
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,600
[the happiest person]

591
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,950
[in the world right now.]

592
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,040
Finance manager of Shunjue?

593
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,360
Uncle,

594
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,040
thank you for telling me.

595
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,430
But

596
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,230
I'm not thinking of

597
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,510
leaving Dairui yet.

598
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,750
I know it's a rare opportunity.

599
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,360
I'll think about it.

600
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,910
Thank you, Mr. Li.

601
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,800
[Do it yourself.]

602
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,990
Good news.

603
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,270
My fellow brothers

604
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,470
and sisters.

605
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,560
It's finally our turn

606
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,470
to enjoy the fortune.

607
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,600
Li Xiang.

608
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,750
A round of applause.

609
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,750
I,

610
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,230
your dearest Fanggang,

611
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,950
has been shortlisted for

612
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,080
the business cadre

613
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,040
competition this round

614
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,710
due to my

615
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,600
outstanding competence!

616
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,910
More applause, Li Xiang!

617
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,230
Hurray!

618
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,990
[Congratulations!]

619
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,800
[Thank you.]

620
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,120
You know

621
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,430
the non-performing loan thing.

622
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,400
The superiors were thinking

623
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,160
I was unreliable.

624
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,990
This time

625
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,880
I've made

626
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,040
a clean break.

627
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,080
Not only this time,

628
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,840
Mr. Zhao.

629
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,270
The last time we secured a deal

630
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,160
of 8 hundred million.

631
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
We couldn't have made it

632
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
without you.

633
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,040
Applaud!

634
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,800
You're making me flush.

635
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,190
It's a credit

636
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
to you, Ms. Rao,

637
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,750
and everybody here

638
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,600
too.

639
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,880
This applause

640
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,400
is for everyone!

641
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,990
I'm not done yet.

642
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,430
All of you have made

643
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,560
outstanding contributions to

644
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,190
this government deposit program.

645
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,560
Li Xiang,

646
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,560
you can get a salary raise!

647
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,190
Really?

648
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,080
[I can get a raise?]

649
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,560
Xu Li.

650
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,230
Congrats.

651
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,670
You're now

652
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,990
an account manager

653
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,830
of the highest rank!

654
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,160
Next step,

655
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,679
you'll be in line

656
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,600
for Senior Account Manager.

657
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,080
Seriously?

658
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,120
[I never thought]

659
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,800
[I'd go for Senior Manager.]

660
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,479
[I thought getting to Tier 3]

661
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,080
[would take me]

662
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,679
[at least another]

663
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,919
2 or 3 more years.

664
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,040
The boss already

665
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,160
signed off at HR.

666
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,800
It's the real deal!

667
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,759
Our leader deserves a statue!

668
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,600
A statue? You should be crying!

669
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,959
No way, I'm not crying!

670
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,160
Fanggang,

671
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,160
what about Jing?

672
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:26,880
Ms. Rao

673
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,080
got promoted

674
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,360
to Chief Account Manager,

675
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,120
a rare honor!

676
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,719
Congratulations, Jing!

677
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:40,439
Congrats, Ms. Rao!

678
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,120
I heard

679
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,320
they sent

680
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,400
ten candidates to HQ,

681
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
even before the

682
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,600
[government project was secured.]

683
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,400
[Could it be that Mr. Ji]

684
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,719
[had this planned?]

685
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:51,919
[Don't you think?]

686
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,800
The boss is really sharp

687
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,199
how did he

688
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,279
even predict this?

689
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,519
Maybe it wasn't about predicting.

690
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,160
He believes in us

691
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:01,360
and in Jing.

692
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,120
Group photo

693
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,199
by the front sign

694
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,400
to commemorate

695
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,360
S1's

696
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,880
two straight quarters

697
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
of top rankings!

698
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:11,999
Let's go!

699
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:12,880
Let's go.

700
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,120
Today is just too exciting.

701
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,679
See you in a bit!

702
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:17,840
See you!

703
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:24,999
If you want to say thank you,

704
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,040
just say it.

705
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,360
You're a force

706
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,040
to be reckoned with

707
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,759
in business,

708
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:29,759
but

709
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,239
when it comes to relationship,

710
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,840
it's like your words burn your tongue.

711
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:33,959
Mr. Zhao,

712
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:34,840
are you speaking for me now?

713
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,080
When did I say

714
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,719
I wanted to thank someone?

715
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,320
You didn't say it,

716
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,400
but your face gave you away.

717
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:39,999
I...

718
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,120
Yep,

719
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,759
that little glance down and the pout

720
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:43,560
it says it all.

721
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,040
Mr. Zhao,

722
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,519
do you have some special hobby?

723
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,040
Why are you always watching me?

724
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,600
Got a spying fetish or something?

725
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:53,999
What if I've got

726
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,800
a crush on you?

727
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:05,519
Xiaoning,

728
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,040
why are you standing so far to the side?

729
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:07,800
Move over here.

730
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,759
It'll look better in the photo.

731
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,199
Look at the camera. Come on.

732
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,320
Ms. Tu,

733
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,479
smile naturally!

734
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,800
With such a handsome guy like Mr. Ji

735
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,439
next to you,

736
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,880
you should be beaming!

737
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:20,959
Stop joking around

738
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,400
and just take the picture.

739
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:22,560
All right, hold it.

740
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,160
In

741
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,040
3,

742
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,600
2,

743
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,160
1...

744
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,080
Okay, listen up.

745
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,040
Go home and pack your things,

746
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,199
and you can start

747
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:42,959
officially tomorrow.

748
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,560
Got it, see you tomorrow.

749
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,479
Qi Yu.

750
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:52,199
Uh... My girlfriend's here.

751
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,999
See you tomorrow.

752
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,199
All right, see you tomorrow.

753
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,040
Congrats!

754
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:57,999
Here,

755
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,679
I took leave just to be here.

756
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,160
I knew I had to witness you

757
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,679
becoming a police officer.

758
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,600
I know how hard

759
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,400
you've worked to get here,

760
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,679
and I'm so proud of you.

761
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,560
We might not see each other

762
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,880
as much at work anymore,

763
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,719
but don't worry,

764
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,199
I'll do my best

765
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:15,880
at the new place

766
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,880
and honor the police badge.

767
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes, sir.

768
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,040
I prepared

769
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
a little something

770
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,999
to celebrate your new job.

771
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,120
I thought this is the gift.

772
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,800
There's more.

773
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,600
More?

774
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,439
I can do it on my own.

775
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Starting tomorrow,

776
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,120
you'll be in uniform,

777
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
and if you want to stand out,

778
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,560
you've got to start with your shoes.

779
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,439
Weiyi, actually,

780
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,040
the unit provides us with shoes.

781
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,759
You don't have to do this.

782
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:43,719
It's fine.

783
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:45,880
My dad's a regular here.

784
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,439
The shoes here

785
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,040
are not only comfortable

786
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,519
but also have a low-key style

787
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:51,840
that people who know will appreciate.

788
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,719
[We just got in]

789
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:53,880
[two pieces of crocodile leather today,]

790
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,800
[enough to make a pair]

791
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,880
[in this gentleman's size.]

792
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,560
Crocodile leather?

793
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,199
No, no,

794
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,239
that's too much.

795
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,199
Would you prefer calfskin?

796
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:01,999
French

797
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:02,759
or Italian?

798
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,080
Weiyi,

799
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,239
I actually...

800
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,999
I remember you told me

801
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,519
your uniform is dark,

802
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,959
so let's go with the French leather

803
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,239
and a

804
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,560
subtle gradient brown.

805
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,959
[No problem,]

806
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,320
[it'll be ready in two weeks.]

807
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,600
[You can pay the deposit over here.]

808
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,080
Sure.

809
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:17,560
Weiyi...

810
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,199
I know what you're going to say.

811
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:21,840
Qi Yu,

812
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,040
becoming a police officer

813
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,560
is a huge

814
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,719
milestone in your life,

815
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
and I have to give you

816
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,800
a fitting gift.

817
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:29,959
If you keep protesting,

818
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,439
I'll be upset.

819
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,040
That's a yes, right?

820
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:44,400
Yes!

821
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,800
Time to clock out!

822
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,320
Today's the first day of my raise,

823
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,880
so I'm treating myself.

824
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,439
What about you guys?

825
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,959
I'm planning to have

826
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,560
a big meal

827
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,160
and really spoil myself.

828
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,600
I have to attend

829
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,479
a dinner party with my dad.

830
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,519
A dinner party?

831
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,679
Yuhui,

832
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:00,439
um...

833
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:01,400
can I tag along

834
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,360
and see how the big shots live?

835
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,719
My crowd is full of VIPs.

836
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,560
Xiaoning,

837
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
there's a new BBQ place.

838
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,160
Want to check it out with me?

839
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,999
Sorry, my parents

840
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:16,800
are expecting me

841
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:17,800
for dinner at home.

842
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:18,479
Maybe

843
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,439
next time, though?

844
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:21,519
No worries.

845
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
I've got other plans anyway.

846
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,959
[We'll go next time.]

847
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,040
Jing,

848
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,279
let me guess

849
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,479
you're hitting up a bar tonight,

850
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:28,919
having some drinks,

851
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,560
and dancing with some handsome guys.

852
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
Is that even a guess?

853
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,840
It's basically my signature move.

854
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:37,840
Right, Fanggang,

855
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:39,320
any plans tonight?

856
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:39,800
Want to

857
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,919
grab dinner with me?

858
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:41,919
No plans.

859
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,439
I'm saving

860
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,919
every penny for my projects,

861
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,679
trying to make

862
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,199
some money.

863
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,719
Fanggang,

864
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,080
are you talking about

865
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,199
the bike project?

866
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,880
I've discussed it with Jing before.

867
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,959
Need a hand?

868
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,080
No need, Xiaoning,

869
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:56,840
but thanks.

870
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,519
I wouldn't want

871
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,080
to trouble our

872
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,040
Chief Account Manager with small stuff.

873
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:02,959
I'm heading out.

874
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:04,439
Bye.

875
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,880
Bye.

876
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
See you, Fanggang.

877
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,719
Bye, everyone.

878
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:17,279
All right,

879
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,759
let's go.

880
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,840
Everyone's got family, friends,

881
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,400
and someone special.

882
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,840
How can they all be so lively?

883
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,999
You okay?

884
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,919
You seem down.

885
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:53,400
I got promoted.

886
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,959
Congrats!

887
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,080
Thanks.

888
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,880
But besides telling you,

889
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:02,759
I don't know who else

890
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,679
to share it with.

891
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,679
I used to see you

892
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,400
with a bunch of guys here.

893
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,600
[What happened?]

894
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,360
[You're always alone lately.]

895
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,080
Really?

896
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,560
I didn't

897
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,479
even notice.

898
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm fine, you go ahead.

899
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,080
Sure.

900
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,719
Let's see...

901
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,199
Doesn't seem that exciting.

902
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,160
Happy promotion to me.

903
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,880
My daughter has worked so hard for this.

904
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,999
[Finally, she's made it.]

905
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,519
[She's officially an Account Manager now.]

906
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,120
It's just a promotion,

907
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,320
why are you both so excited?

908
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,439
How did her important photo

909
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,360
turn out so bad?

910
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:28,479
Yuheng,

911
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,199
can this photo be retaken?

912
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:31,400
I think it looks great.

913
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,519
Stop it.

914
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,959
No matter what, she's your daughter.

915
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,719
My daughter is beautiful,

916
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,679
just didn't wear makeup.

917
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,040
Yours isn't so great either.

918
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,040
What's going on with you two?

919
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,239
I just got promoted,

920
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:43,880
and instead of praising me,

921
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,320
you're criticizing my photo.

922
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,719
[Is it really that bad? Let me see.]

923
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,519
Is it?

924
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,279
It's not bad at all.

925
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,759
Makeup or no makeup,

926
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,279
you're the most beautiful

927
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,120
in my eyes.

928
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:57,880
See,

929
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,080
learn from our son-in-law.

930
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,439
Dad, all thanks to you.

931
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,880
My wife's the most beautiful ever,

932
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,840
and so is my daughter.

933
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,199
Both are beautiful.

934
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,959
Now that's more like it.

935
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:10,840
Listen,

936
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,120
every time I get a promotion or a raise,

937
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,439
we'll have a big feast,

938
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,040
on me.

939
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:16,560
Fine,

940
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,199
but next time you get promoted,

941
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,479
make sure the photo turns out better.

942
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,560
Xiaoning,

943
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,199
dad wishes you continued success.

944
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,279
Within 10 years,

945
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,239
you'll be a bank president.

946
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,519
A bank president?

947
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:29,120
President Tu.

948
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,999
Or President Ji.

949
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:38,040
Now that your promotion is settled,

950
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,040
what's your plan?

951
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,320
I plan to

952
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,120
take a slow

953
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,719
walk home with Ji.

954
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,160
I overate earlier.

955
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,320
I meant

956
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,400
your work plan.

957
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,679
What,

958
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,959
are you

959
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,120
trying to dig into

960
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,679
my KPI progress?

961
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,679
No comment.

962
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,160
Speaking of progress,

963
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,479
doesn't every bit of yours

964
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,600
pass through me anyway?

965
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,439
No need to dig.

966
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,479
True enough.

967
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:05,959
My short-term goal

968
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,400
is to attend tomorrow's

969
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,239
glass product launch

970
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,719
and do some serious marketing.

971
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,320
Mid-term,

972
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,239
I'll hit

973
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,080
our KPI

974
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,679
from the bet,

975
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,400
securing 50 million in savings.

976
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:19,439
But with

977
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,759
the 800 million in government deposits

978
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,439
we just secured,

979
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,239
doesn't that already

980
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,320
cover your 50 million?

981
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,239
I don't want that.

982
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:25,959
I've got pride.

983
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,479
I want to earn that deposit

984
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,279
on my own merit.

985
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,600
Otherwise, even if I win,

986
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,719
it wouldn't feel right.

987
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,160
Impressive.

988
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,199
What about long-term goals?

989
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:37,959
Long-term?

990
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:40,679
Stick with S1

991
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:41,759
and work hard.

992
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,919
You know

993
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,479
all about my progress,

994
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:48,560
so how about

995
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,519
you share yours with me?

996
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,320
My progress?

997
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:54,959
I'm not so sure.

998
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,959
Come on.

999
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,759
You know everything about me,

1000
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,120
and I know nothing about you.

1001
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,519
This isn't fair.

1002
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,479
Well, that's just how it is.

1003
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,439
It's our

1004
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,519
job roles.

1005
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,959
I'm Mr. Ji,

1006
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:08,959
and you're Xiaoning.

1007
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,800
Fine,

1008
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,719
let me rephrase.

1009
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,999
Now that

1010
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm officially

1011
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,239
your right-hand woman,

1012
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,519
what's the

1013
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,199
next phase

1014
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,759
of your work plan?

1015
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:19,719
That's a fair question, right?

1016
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,600
Speaking of opportunities,

1017
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
there's one right now.

1018
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,040
You've heard of Weiji Group, right?

1019
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:27,919
Of course.

1020
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,719
They're the top leisure

1021
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,960
and tourism company nationwide,

1022
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,799
with resorts

1023
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:33,719
in every

1024
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,719
major city.

1025
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:35,879
This year, they're

1026
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,679
expanding into second-tier cities.

1027
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,560
I got a tip.

1028
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:41,239
They just acquired land

1029
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,000
in the north of the city

1030
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,160
and are planning to move into Xing City.

1031
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,440
So

1032
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,719
if they've just bought land,

1033
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
their funds will be tight.

1034
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,759
If they plan to build a resort,

1035
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,719
they'll likely

1036
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,000
need financing.

1037
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,160
Seems like

1038
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:54,719
you've already

1039
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,679
been eyeing this.

1040
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,359
That's right.

1041
00:34:59,199 --> 00:34:59,719
Think about it,

1042
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,520
since they're developing properties

1043
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,719
in Xing City,

1044
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:04,600
local banks like ours

1045
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,560
will have a chance to work with them.

1046
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,520
Exactly.

1047
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,799
I've already mentioned this

1048
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:09,679
to Xing in S2,

1049
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:10,920
and he's very interested.

1050
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,440
If you're also keen,

1051
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,279
that would be even better.

1052
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,000
With both of you

1053
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,239
working on it,

1054
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,319
our chances of winning are higher,

1055
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and it would significantly

1056
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,239
help you with your next goal.

1057
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,520
As long as you support me,

1058
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,879
I'll give it my all.

1059
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,960
Speaking of the next phase,

1060
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,920
there's something

1061
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,120
I need to discuss with you.

1062
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,640
I'm about

1063
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,040
a rare opportunity

1064
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,679
in my career,

1065
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:38,319
and I want to go for it.

1066
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,719
What kind of opportunity?

1067
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:42,399
Competing for a branch president position.

1068
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,440
What?

1069
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,279
Is the current president stepping down,

1070
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,199
or

1071
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,239
are you staging a coup?

1072
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,279
Neither, of course.

1073
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
The headquarters

1074
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,520
plans to set up

1075
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,239
a new branch

1076
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,359
in Xing City's new district,

1077
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,839
and the president position

1078
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:55,480
is still open.

1079
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,879
You want to apply for it?

1080
00:35:58,839 --> 00:35:59,160
Yes.

1081
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,040
Positions like this

1082
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,399
only open up

1083
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,759
every 4 or 5 years

1084
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,120
in the Xing City

1085
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,160
banking scene.

1086
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,839
If I can

1087
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:08,600
get it,

1088
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,679
it would be

1089
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,600
a huge step forward.

1090
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,160
Otherwise,

1091
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,199
I'll have to wait

1092
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,359
in my current role

1093
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,960
for another 4 or 5 years

1094
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,560
for the next chance.

1095
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,879
It's different for you

1096
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,719
at that level.

1097
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,399
Getting promoted

1098
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,520
is tough.

1099
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,920
You have to wait

1100
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,160
for a spot to open up

1101
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,560
before you can move up.

1102
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,120
With such

1103
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
a great opportunity,

1104
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,199
I'm sure

1105
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,199
many people are eyeing it.

1106
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:34,799
What's your plan?

1107
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,839
Weiji Group is planning

1108
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,120
to develop a resort in Xing City,

1109
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:39,799
and they'll need financing.

1110
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:41,399
The project

1111
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,399
is massive

1112
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:43,679
and complex.

1113
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,520
If someone

1114
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,560
can secure this deal,

1115
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,399
they'll gain significant favor

1116
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,080
with headquarters,

1117
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:50,799
giving them more leverage.

1118
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,399
Weiji Group...

1119
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,239
I studied them once.

1120
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,359
Their CEO is Xia Mingrui,

1121
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,879
but I've heard

1122
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,199
he's very picky.

1123
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,000
Securing this deal won't be easy.

1124
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:04,160
But what's tough for others

1125
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:06,080
is easy for you.

1126
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:07,440
You can

1127
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,160
achieve anything you set your mind to,

1128
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:10,600
and I'll support you

1129
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,000
all the way.

1130
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,160
Does this mean

1131
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,239
I should start calling you

1132
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,319
President Ji?

1133
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,440
That's one

1134
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,399
part of it,

1135
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,319
but there's something more important.

1136
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,239
If I

1137
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,279
get this promotion,

1138
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
I can leave S1,

1139
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:27,319
and we

1140
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,600
can be

1141
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,199
together openly,

1142
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:31,000
without hiding.

1143
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,199
That's a huge benefit!

1144
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,960
All the more reasons to support you.

1145
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,839
But don't

1146
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,520
stress too much.

1147
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:40,920
Don't worry.

1148
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,719
I'm working hard to grow quickly,

1149
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,879
to stand on my own.

1150
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,679
If it

1151
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,040
ever comes to it,

1152
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,279
and one of us has to leave,

1153
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,640
I hope

1154
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:49,799
I'm strong enough

1155
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,319
to land a job even better.

1156
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:55,759
Xiaoning,

1157
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,160
if I succeed,

1158
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,239
let's get married.

1159
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:08,040
Ji Yuheng,

1160
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,679
you're something else.

1161
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,279
A proposal

1162
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,879
with a side of wishful thinking?

1163
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,839
Let's talk about it when you succeed.

1164
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,000
Take the bag.

1165
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,000
I have a full day of marketing tomorrow,

1166
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,239
and my legs are already hurting.

1167
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,279
Got it.

1168
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,799
Let's go home.

1169
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:31,440
Come on,

1170
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,160
I'll give you a piggyback.

1171
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,359
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

1172
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,719
Let's go.

1173
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,080
Hold on tight.

1174
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,000
All set?

1175
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:47,520
Here.

1176
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:47,759
Great.

1177
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,520
This is

1178
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,319
a complimentary

1179
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:51,520
digital scale as a little gift

1180
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
for opening an account.

1181
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,239
You can pick it up

1182
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,080
at any of our

1183
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,799
bank branches.

1184
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,719
Best wishes for your new home.

1185
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:58,319
A digital scale, huh?

1186
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,759
That's actually pretty useful.

1187
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,600
Thanks.

1188
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,279
Hello.

1189
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,920
Just fill out this form,

1190
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,560
and you're all set.

1191
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,279
Xiaoning.

1192
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:08,120
Jing.

1193
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,879
Today's marketing gifts

1194
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:10,679
are on point.

1195
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,920
I figured

1196
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,520
today's crowd would include

1197
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,080
both dealers and people

1198
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,040
looking to renovate,

1199
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:18,319
so

1200
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,359
I chose

1201
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,199
some practical

1202
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,440
small appliances.

1203
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,679
It's all thanks to your guidance.

1204
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:24,839
With your

1205
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,520
practical thinking,

1206
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,120
I'd say

1207
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,120
Ji Yuheng might actually

1208
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,319
have some competition.

1209
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:32,960
Really?

1210
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:34,719
[Geng Nianyi is here!]

1211
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:43,199
[Geng Nianyi!]

1212
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:43,600
Jing.

1213
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:45,279
Wow,

1214
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:47,480
is that her?

1215
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:49,480
She hasn't done

1216
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,759
events in a long time.

1217
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,040
[She's a nationally renowned host,]

1218
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,759
but has stayed low-key since marriage.

1219
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,160
It took

1220
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:57,960
a lot to get her

1221
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:59,440
here today.

1222
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:06,480
Hello, everyone,

1223
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,719
I'm Geng Nianyi.

1224
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,319
Welcome to the

1225
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:11,040
Wutong Glass New Product Launch.

1226
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,120
Wutong Glass

1227
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,440
is a well-known brand that has been

1228
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
leading the decoration industry

1229
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,679
for over a decade,

1230
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,120
consistently holding

1231
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,040
the top spot

1232
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,719
as the industry leader.

1233
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,719
Mr. Liu,

1234
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,799
why did they choose

1235
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,160
to get Geng Nianyi to come?

1236
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:25,879
She's got strong business skills,

1237
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,839
a great reputation,

1238
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:27,520
and high popularity.

1239
00:40:27,879 --> 00:40:29,160
In the era of social media,

1240
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,560
finding someone this well-rounded

1241
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:31,319
isn't easy.

1242
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,960
Look,

1243
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:36,879
[look at the live stream numbers]

1244
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,520
[they're skyrocketing.]

1245
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,560
[People are swarming in.]

1246
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:42,879
She's beautiful,

1247
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,199
talented,

1248
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,600
yet married?

1249
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,520
Mr. Liu,

1250
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,399
who did she end up with?

1251
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,399
Rumor has it

1252
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,199
she married into

1253
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,679
a mysterious, prominent family,

1254
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,080
which led her to step back.

1255
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,359
But who she married

1256
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:03,560
is still a mystery.

1257
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,160
She really is stunning.

1258
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,799
We've been waiting here

1259
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:23,799
for four hours.

1260
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,839
If nothing goes wrong, meeting with

1261
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:27,839
Mr. Xia is about to go wrong.

1262
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:33,520
Secretary Liu,

1263
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,440
is Mr. Xia available now?

1264
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,600
Sorry, Mr. Ji,

1265
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:37,759
the last meeting

1266
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:38,799
ran a bit over,

1267
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,719
and Mr. Xia had to

1268
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:40,440
rush to the next one.

1269
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,120
He won't

1270
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,399
have time to see you today.

1271
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,040
I understand.

1272
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,359
Can we

1273
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,120
schedule for tomorrow?

1274
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,879
I'm afraid not, Mr. Ji.

1275
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,239
Mr. Xia's schedule is fully booked

1276
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:49,920
for the next week.

1277
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:51,399
[You might have to wait a bit longer.]

1278
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:52,600
All right,

1279
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:53,560
thanks.

1280
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,160
Should we come up with a plan?

1281
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,560
At this rate,

1282
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,279
Mr. Xia will probably

1283
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,440
still be busy next week.

1284
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,679
In an hour,

1285
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,839
he will be at his private squash court

1286
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,040
in the north of the city.

1287
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,560
Private squash court,

1288
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,000
members-only,

1289
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,719
owned by someone named Xu.

1290
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,679
Does that ring a bell?

1291
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,359
You've only been here six months,

1292
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,839
and you remember my client

1293
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:34,480
from a year and a half ago?

1294
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,399
This photo looks like

1295
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:01,520
the smile is a bit forced.

1296
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,199
Not at all.

1297
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,679
No matter how you smile,

1298
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:05,560
I always think you look great.

1299
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:54,839
[Class,]

1300
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,879
[time's up.]

1301
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,359
[Please place your exams on the desk]

1302
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,279
[and exit in an orderly manner.]
