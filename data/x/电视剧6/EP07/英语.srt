00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available

00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:46,120
You Are My Secret EP07

3
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,360
Poor little thing,

4
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,959
life is rough on you.

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,959
Cutie,

6
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,599
what are you going to do?

7
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,840
What's wrong, Dad?

8
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,000
Look at it, so pitiful.

9
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,479
It used to live in the big tank

10
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,679
and was pushed around

11
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,519
by bigger fishes.

12
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,399
I moved it

13
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,679
to this small one.

14
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,599
But your mom

15
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,879
always thinks it's a hassle.

16
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,319
She rarely

17
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,319
feed it.

18
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,039
Look,

19
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,560
Hunger is damaging it.

20
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,720
It looks lifeless.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,319
Your mom

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
wants to give it away,

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,280
but I can't let it go.

24
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,960
What should I do?

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,199
Xiaoning,

26
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,759
can you take it?

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,799
You're the most caring.

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,240
I know

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,560
you'll take good care of it.

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,520
If you take it,

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
I can visit it

32
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,280
when I miss it.

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,039
All right,

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,120
I will

35
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,160
take it home.

36
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:01,799
Really?

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,560
I'll give you

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,240
some fish food too.

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,639
Take it now.

40
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,919
Dad, why are you

41
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,759
in such a hurry?

42
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,039
I said I will take it.

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,359
Before your mom

44
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,240
give it away.

45
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:13,799
Hurry,

46
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:14,400
take it now.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,319
Go, go, go.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,000
I haven't eaten yet.

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,639
Just go.

50
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,199
Wait,

51
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,240
why is the fish gone?

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,440
I was about to feed it.

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,160
What fish?

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,840
It's been given away.

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,840
Feed what?

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,359
Forget it.

57
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,960
I... I just bought new fish food.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
What do you mean?

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,919
Poor thing.

60
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,160
Xiaoning,

61
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,079
Can we talk?

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,160
If it is at your convenience.

63
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,680
All couples argue.

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,079
It's normal for a couple

65
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,599
to have disagreements

66
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,720
or conflicts.

67
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,400
If you both decide

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,960
to stay together,

69
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,000
just give it your all

70
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,280
and make it work.

71
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,359
Allow me.

72
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,440
Take it home.

73
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
We can have the talk at home.

74
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,960
Did you do that on purpose?

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,120
Look,

76
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,560
actually, Yuheng

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,720
is a really good kid.

78
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,639
Last night, he was worried

79
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,599
that Xiaoning wouldn't sleep well,

80
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,280
so he came over to bring things.

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,320
To cheer her up,

82
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,239
he was calling and asking questions.

83
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,599
As parents,

84
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:39,119
sometimes we need

85
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,520
to give a little push.

86
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,160
Just like us back then,

87
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,080
if someone

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,840
had helped us,

89
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,359
you know,

90
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,400
we would

91
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,840
have avoided many detours.

92
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:48,880
You've said

93
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,119
all the good things.

94
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,799
You think I don't want them to be well?

95
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,479
My thinking is,

96
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,960
if they have problems,

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:55,799
they need

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,039
to talk them out.

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,599
Relying on gestures

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,239
and covering things up

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,479
isn't enough.

102
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
They need to

103
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,599
address and

104
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:03,880
clarify the issues.

105
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,280
What is it?

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,080
Dad,

107
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,559
I want to talk to Xiaoning alone

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
to clear up our misunderstandings.

109
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,880
Can you help me?

110
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,999
Now you're having private chats.

111
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,239
Forming little family cliques?

112
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,799
Last night, you and our daughter

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,919
had a long

114
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,760
heart-to-heart chat

115
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,919
without me.

116
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,080
All right,

117
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,160
don't be jealous.

118
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:29,439
Let's go

119
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,479
tidy up

120
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,520
our daughter's room.

121
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,599
It looks like

122
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,280
she won't be coming back

123
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,999
to stay the tonight.

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,239
From now on,

125
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:47,760
you feed the fish.

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
I'll clean the tank, change the water.

127
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,200
The fish is mine;

128
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,080
I can

129
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,919
handle it alone.

130
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,320
Since it's at our house,

131
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,359
it's our fish.

132
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,080
Back then,

133
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,439
you said you had something to tell me.

134
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,200
Go ahead.

135
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:10,960
I know

136
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,160
you're upset about

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,679
the Zhao Fanggang situation,

138
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,280
and I need a chance to explain it.

139
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,599
Even though

140
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,080
Zhao Fanggang didn't make

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,359
the decisions about the dating loan,

142
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,720
he's still responsible for oversight.

143
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
The knife attack incident

144
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,760
led to enormous implications.

145
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,359
Mr. Xing finally

146
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,479
found a mistake on our part,

147
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,919
and the branch manager

148
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,840
needs to have somebody account for it.

149
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,439
Zhao Fanggang

150
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,119
must be dealt with seriously,

151
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,080
or it wouldn't be justifiable.

152
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,640
How do you

153
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,720
plan to handle it?

154
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:44,880
Either transfer him

155
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,999
or demote him.

156
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:47,520
Sir,

157
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
you previously mentioned that

158
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,280
Mr. Xing from section two

159
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,239
has been looking

160
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,479
for a way to bring down section one.

161
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,439
You sent me to section one

162
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160
to turn things around

163
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,439
and protect it, right?

164
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Sacrificing him

165
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,880
is to protect section one.

166
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,400
Xing might

167
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
escalate this

168
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,359
to higher-ups.

169
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,559
If that happens, the situation

170
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,080
could become even harder to manage.

171
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,320
If you want to

172
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,280
protect section one

173
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,280
and ensure

174
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,200
its development,

175
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:13,720
I can't

176
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,799
do it alone.

177
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,679
I need him,

178
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,559
and he's capable.

179
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,799
Sir, I have an idea.

180
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,280
Would you like to hear it?

181
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:24,720
Go ahead.

182
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,080
Perhaps we can give him a stern warning

183
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,200
by publicly criticizing him

184
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,479
within the department

185
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,280
and taking away a few of his clients.

186
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,559
Everyone in banking knows

187
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,679
the importance

188
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,239
of major loan clients

189
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:36,880
to a client manager.

190
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,599
This might

191
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,359
be enough to satisfy everyone.

192
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
A 30%

193
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,479
bonus deduction this month

194
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,999
and handover of five clients.

195
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,919
As for Li Xiang's tardiness, I wasn't

196
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,080
trying to make things difficult for him.

197
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,919
Every time I arrive,

198
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,400
nobody's there.

199
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,559
If this continues,

200
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,640
I don't know how

201
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,720
to keep collaborating with Dairui.

202
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:01,679
Please don't be upset.

203
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,280
I understand your frustration.

204
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,799
On behalf of Mr. Li,

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,439
I apologize.

206
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,559
You drove here

207
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,479
this morning, right?

208
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,400
Yes.

209
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:10,160
Tomorrow,

210
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,320
I'll have Mr. Li send you

211
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,359
one of our bank's

212
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,799
co-branded fuel cards

213
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,359
as an apology.

214
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:16,439
All right.

215
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,039
Take care.

216
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,999
That client was really angry and

217
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,200
wanted to file a complaint against him.

218
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,359
It's rare for a credit manager

219
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,039
to get customer complaints.

220
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,760
If it happens,

221
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,520
he might

222
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,640
get transferred.

223
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,439
You can

224
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,960
tell me this,

225
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,039
or you can tell everyone.

226
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,280
This is how you are.

227
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,720
I know,

228
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,559
I tend to keep things to myself.

229
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
Since you're telling me,

230
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,559
does it mean...

231
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,240
I'll definitely work hard

232
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,400
to change these bad habits.

233
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:57,160
"Work hard" is something

234
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
you tell yourself.

235
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,039
I'm result-oriented.

236
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,880
Why are you smiling?

237
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,559
Didn't you

238
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,880
say this yourself?

239
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,319
I'll do what I say.

240
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,240
But I hope

241
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,120
you do the same.

242
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,039
Me?

243
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,039
What about me?

244
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,319
I hope

245
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,679
you don't give up

246
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,799
on this relationship easily.

247
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,360
My mom told me

248
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,280
that every relationship needs

249
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,959
a period of running-in.

250
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,079
Even though we're not married,

251
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,079
it's normal

252
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,000
to have

253
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,760
some conflicts.

254
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,319
I'm not someone who gives up

255
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,280
when faced with difficulties.

256
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:42,679
Don't worry.

257
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,679
Since it's in our home now,

258
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:52,600
should we

259
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,760
give it a name?

260
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:54,959
Sure.

261
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,600
How about Little White?

262
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,360
Little White?

263
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:01,880
Doesn't it sound nice?

264
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,079
What if

265
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,240
it's a girl?

266
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,880
How about

267
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,319
Nemo?

268
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,799
All right,

269
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:10,959
let's go with your choice.

270
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,600
Since you named it,

271
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,039
changing the water

272
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,559
and cleaning the tank

273
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
will still be your job.

274
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:19,880
No problem.

275
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,120
In addition to follow up

276
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,679
with our premium clients,

277
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,839
for the next three months,

278
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:31,240
I want you

279
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,360
to focus on

280
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,160
marketing of

281
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,360
new clients.

282
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,520
I've sent

283
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,719
the recommended client list

284
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,120
to your work emails.

285
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,120
Are you feeling unwell?

286
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,120
Mr. Zhao?

287
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,360
Are you talking to me?

288
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,959
Yes, about new client marketing.

289
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,199
Punching in at 8:30

290
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:10,719
made me anxious,

291
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,839
and I didn't sleep well last night.

292
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,199
But you're right,

293
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,679
I might be coming down with something.

294
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,559
I'll take some medicine later.

295
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,919
When I

296
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,919
don't sleep well,

297
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,880
I don't have energy for anything.

298
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:27,520
Everyone,

299
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,199
review the client info quickly.

300
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,600
If your clients

301
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:32,719
have new loan needs,

302
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,480
follow up with them.

303
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,360
If you have any questions or ideas,

304
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,520
come to my office.

305
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,959
Meeting adjourned.

306
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,439
Mr. Fang, with due respect,

307
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,719
the loan rates at Dairui

308
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,480
are much lower

309
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,799
than our competitors.

310
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,559
Hello, Mr. Fang?

311
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,199
Hello?

312
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,439
Mr. Zhao.

313
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,240
What's up?

314
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:08,880
You'll handle the

315
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,520
Chenyue Group project.

316
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,760
They need

317
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,880
a loan,

318
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,120
and other banks

319
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,959
are vying for it,

320
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,079
but I believe

321
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,280
they will be more interested

322
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,199
in Dairui's terms.

323
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,600
A big group.

324
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,280
A good work.

325
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't do it.

326
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,439
Mr. Ji,

327
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,120
Jing has been

328
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:58,439
handling the

329
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,719
Chenyue project,

330
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,319
but I'm not sure

331
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,480
of the details.

332
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,319
Mr. Ji,

333
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,199
a sincere reminder:

334
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,640
section one

335
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,959
is not the Compliance Dept,

336
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:42,919
and you're not here

337
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,120
to inspect.

338
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,919
Relax a bit

339
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,120
and get along with everyone.

340
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,839
It's time

341
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,079
for a change in approach.

342
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,880
Fanggang.

343
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,919
Coffee.

344
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,360
Thanks.

345
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,319
Is it good?

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,760
Xiaoning, your coffee-making skills

347
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,799
have leveled up.

348
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,240
If that Ji guy

349
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,559
ever gives you a hard time,

350
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,160
just open

351
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,280
a café

352
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,039
and ask Jing for a loan.

353
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,919
Fanggang,

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
are you planning to

355
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,079
keep butting heads with Mr. Ji?

356
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,839
It's not that I want to,

357
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,439
he's the one tripping me up.

358
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,719
Don't side with him.

359
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm not siding with anyone.

360
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,880
I mean,

361
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,880
work

362
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,839
is work.

363
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,959
If...

364
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,839
What "if"?

365
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,520
I haven't been late, haven't left early,

366
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,240
haven't disappeared.

367
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,120
The most I've done

368
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,959
is refusing an unsuitable task.

369
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,600
Can he fire me

370
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,480
for that?

371
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,280
Do you think I'm stupid?

372
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,120
I see through Ji Yuheng.

373
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:49,400
There's no way

374
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,360
he'd

375
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,600
give me the Chenyue project.

376
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,839
He's probably

377
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,360
set a trap for me

378
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,719
so he can pin something on me

379
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,319
and get rid of me.

380
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
The more I do,

381
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,880
the more mistakes I'll make.

382
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:02,959
It's best to do nothing.

383
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,959
I don't think he's targeting you.

384
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,520
He's not as bad as you say.

385
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,839
He's just

386
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,079
straightforward

387
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,160
and doesn't consider

388
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,439
others' feelings

389
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,360
when he speaks,

390
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,319
but he's a good person.

391
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,079
He is.

392
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,360
You are siding with him.

393
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,679
Xiaoning,

394
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
from what you're saying,

395
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,000
you seem

396
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,719
to know Mr. Ji quite well.

397
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
I... I'm just guessing.

398
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,799
We all work in the same department.

399
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,199
If things are a mess,

400
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,559
it doesn't benefit him either.

401
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:33,360
Weren't you

402
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,400
handling Chenyue?

403
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,039
You take it.

404
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,480
I need you

405
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,240
to tell me

406
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:38,640
what to do?

407
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,079
Jing,

408
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,240
if you take the project,

409
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,199
can I come along?

410
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,480
I'm willing to do anything.

411
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,559
I just want to learn.

412
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,880
I have an exam coming up.

413
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,480
If I don't pass this time,

414
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,160
I won't get permanent contract.

415
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
You want to make a leap

416
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
in such a short time?

417
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,120
Let me tell you,

418
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,839
don't rush.

419
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,600
Steady progress is key.

420
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,520
Otherwise,

421
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,839
mistakes will be

422
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,000
your only teacher.

423
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,559
Are you mocking me?

424
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,039
Why are you

425
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,240
discouraging Xiaoning?

426
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,400
She just wants to learn from you.

427
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,280
I'm just

428
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,520
being honest with her.

429
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,079
There are no shortcuts in the workplace.

430
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,640
Don't try to run

431
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,719
before you can walk.

432
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,000
What if you fall,

433
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:16,600
right?

434
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,439
And remember,

435
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,719
as long as

436
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,199
you're competent,

437
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,719
no one can push you out.

438
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,439
Understand?

439
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
That's not always true.

440
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,439
Even the upright

441
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,839
fear schemes from petty people.

442
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,120
If that's the case,

443
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,839
the petty person

444
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,600
should be easy to catch.

445
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,160
It should be

446
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,719
easy to find his faults.

447
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,319
He's a wolf in sheep's skin.

448
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:35,240
Rao Jing,

449
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,439
guess you want Ji Yuheng

450
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:37,640
to get rid of me

451
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,679
and leave some dirt for you to use,

452
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,959
so you can

453
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,919
profit from it?

454
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,000
That's wishful thinking.

455
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,039
Do I need

456
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,439
to say it out loud?

457
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,760
But Zhao Fanggang,

458
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,799
your narrow mind

459
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,360
and limited vision

460
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
are as small as a pinhole.

461
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,719
Tiny.

462
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:55,679
What do you mean?

463
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,000
Xiaoning,

464
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,959
am I narrow-minded?

465
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,919
Fanggang,

466
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,000
I have something to do.

467
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:03,760
Go ahead.

468
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,439
I'll be leaving.

469
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,079
Thanks, everyone.

470
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,240
See you there.

471
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,240
What's there to celebrate?

472
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,959
He left

473
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,360
without hesitation,

474
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,320
and now

475
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,519
he's making a grand return?

476
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:20,479
Is there really

477
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,999
something worth celebrating?

478
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,439
Qi Yu

479
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,759
never

480
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,320
liked crowds.

481
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,160
I bet

482
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,120
someone else organized this.

483
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,239
Who else?

484
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,959
It must be your ex, Lu Sijing,

485
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:33,959
suddenly showing up.

486
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:34,999
Keep your voice down.

487
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,759
Those two

488
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,679
are like

489
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,679
peas in a pod.

490
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,479
No wonder they're such good friends.

491
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,279
What do you think,

492
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:45,959
are you going?

493
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,560
No,

494
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,600
I don't want to see him.

495
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,759
And he had the nerve

496
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,479
to tag us.

497
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:55,999
Just ignore him,

498
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:57,400
pretend you didn't see it.

499
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,759
See you this weekend,

500
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,080
Xiaoning and I will be there.

501
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
What are you doing?

502
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:04,279
Why be afraid?

503
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,400
We're not the ones who broke promises.

504
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,239
If they can

505
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,120
show their faces,

506
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,040
why should we hide?

507
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,519
You're right.

508
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,840
They should be the ones hiding.

509
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,919
I'm telling you,

510
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,560
let's dress up

511
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,679
beautifully.

512
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,959
It's a class reunion;

513
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,759
let's have fun.

514
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,120
Fine,

515
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
but don't drink too much.

516
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:25,919
I won't.

517
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,519
When have you not drunk too much?

518
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:38,600
Sijing.

519
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,560
Thanks for your effort.

520
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,080
How did he change so much?

521
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,279
Here, have some food.

522
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,600
He looks different from before.

523
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,199
Freshly grilled, try it.

524
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,719
Everyone, eat while it's hot.

525
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,360
These peppers are nice,

526
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,120
quite sweet,

527
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,719
with a rejuvenating taste.

528
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,959
When we were at the supermarket,

529
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,120
Qi Yu said

530
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,360
you love grilled peppers,

531
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,360
so he picked them one by one.

532
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,800
Well, I also like the supermarket.

533
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,959
Why didn't he bring that over?

534
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,679
Everyone's here,

535
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,360
let's toast to Qi Yu.

536
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:25,080
Sure.

537
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,719
He's the

538
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:26,600
guest of honor today,

539
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,279
but he's been busy the whole time.

540
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:29,239
Thanks for your hard work.

541
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,719
Sorry, I'm on duty

542
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,239
as a driver for my boss,

543
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,519
so I'm on call 24/7

544
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,120
and can't drink.

545
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll toast

546
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,759
with water, okay?

547
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,479
You all enjoy.

548
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,919
Why come if you can't drink?

549
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,759
Come on,

550
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,479
let's drink.

551
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,360
What about you and Ji Yuheng?

552
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,439
Any developments

553
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,759
after the pre-wedding party?

554
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,320
I can tell

555
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,479
he likes you.

556
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,479
Just old classmates meeting,

557
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,800
nothing much.

558
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,719
Can you tell them for me?

559
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:11,679
Sure.

560
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,120
Remember?

561
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,840
You loved watching us

562
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,360
play basketball when we were in school.

563
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,919
The players are all here today.

564
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,320
Over the years,

565
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,080
we can still reunite.

566
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,120
We're getting

567
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,199
worse on basketball,

568
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,719
yet more and more talkative.

569
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:34,519
Watch out!

570
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,279
Sorry!

571
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,959
Come with us, Sijing!

572
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,519
Just like old times,

573
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,400
let Xiaoning

574
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,400
buy us water.

575
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,160
It's Sijing who she used to buy water for.

576
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,239
Don't sponge them off.

577
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,360
You have fun.

578
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm off now.

579
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,679
Xiaoning.

580
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,519
I'm sorry.

581
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,479
I was supposed to come back

582
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,999
and propose on your last birthday.

583
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,400
But I was focused on

584
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,320
improving my studies

585
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,120
at that time.

586
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:04,999
And I never let go

587
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,120
of what we had,

588
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,519
and I haven't done anything

589
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,279
wrong to you.

590
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,959
You don't have to explain

591
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,239
or apologize to me.

592
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:17,959
I know,

593
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,279
I've hurt you.

594
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,279
And I know

595
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,439
we can't go back anymore.

596
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,160
But, Xiaoning,

597
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,439
have you ever thought

598
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,279
our feelings to each other were real

599
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,279
after all these years.

600
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,560
I'm sure you haven't

601
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,600
completely let go either.

602
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:31,560
Otherwise, why didn't you

603
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,400
choose Ji Yuheng

604
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,239
who is excellent

605
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,919
and likes you.

606
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,560
That's my business,

607
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,239
not yours.

608
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:40,439
Fine.

609
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,600
We're not talking about him.

610
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,800
If I didn't need to keep this

611
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,560
relationship a secret,

612
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
why would I waste my time

613
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,759
talking to you?

614
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:48,719
Let's talk about ourselves.

615
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
I don't want to

616
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,519
talk about ourselves.

617
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,040
There's nothing I can say to you.

618
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,160
Looks like the arm's

619
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,120
pretty much healed.

620
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,040
It wasn't a serious injury anyway,

621
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,439
Now it's almost healed.

622
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,160
Seems like Section 1

623
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,560
is in a turmoil.

624
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,800
I heard you and Zhao Fanggang

625
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,320
had arguments in the office.

626
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,679
It's all settled.

627
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,040
I did have some management

628
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,479
problems this time.

629
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,640
I promise

630
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,800
it won't

631
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
happen again.

632
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:38,120
The problem has been in Section 1

633
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,479
for a long time.

634
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,239
It's hard enough

635
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
for you to take it over.

636
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,400
But I'd like to

637
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,239
remind you.

638
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,080
The Section 1 of BDD

639
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,999
is different from Compliance Dept.

640
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,560
You need a teamwork.

641
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,759
Only when the people are united

642
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,840
can the team be better led.

643
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,439
I know what you mean.

644
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,679
I've been told

645
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,679
something similar before.

646
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm getting old

647
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
and talkative.

648
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,080
You mind my nagging?

649
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,679
Of course not.

650
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,199
Qi Yu.

651
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,800
You have the nerve

652
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,360
to be a company driver!

653
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,360
You crashed my car!

654
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,160
Cracks me up.

655
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,959
Have some water.

656
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,439
Game over.

657
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,719
I'm done.

658
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:57,959
I'm leaving.

659
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:58,679
Going back.

660
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:59,360
Be careful.

661
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,360
Xiaoning!

662
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:01,919
I'm here!

663
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,040
Look out for her.

664
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,040
Xiaoning.

665
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,320
Are you alright?

666
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,160
Weiyi's drunk.

667
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,320
You guys have fun.

668
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:10,360
I'll take her home first.

669
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
I can take her home.

670
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,160
I wanna go home.

671
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,800
I brought my car,

672
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,560
and I didn't drink.

673
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,320
Okay.

674
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,560
Give me her bag.

675
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,360
Alright, we go home.

676
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,080
Go home.

677
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Hello, sir.

678
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,199
Am I going now?

679
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,120
It's not far.

680
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,040
Okay.

681
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,999
I'll be there.

682
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,160
You can do your job.

683
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,679
I'll take her back.

684
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,080
Weiyi likes to sleep on her back.

685
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,120
Watch out if she pukes and chokes.

686
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,560
And give her

687
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,199
a glass of honey water before bed.

688
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,120
Don't worry.

689
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,160
She's okay even to drink alone

690
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,679
when you're not around.

691
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,679
It's alright.

692
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,560
How about I take...

693
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,320
Let's go home.

694
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,959
Let's go.

695
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,880
Take it easy.

696
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:48,279
Here.

697
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:48,999
Let's go.

698
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,560
Alright.

699
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,479
Take care of them.

700
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:52,959
Wait.

701
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,919
Xiaoning, your phone.

702
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,400
I'll give her.

703
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:56,560
Don't worry.

704
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,160
Okay.

705
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:58,919
Uh.

706
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,120
Message me when you get home.

707
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:03,120
Sir.

708
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,600
I'll wait with you a little longer.

709
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,679
It'll take a while

710
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,640
for Qi to get here.

711
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,519
It's okay.

712
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,759
It's after hours.

713
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm not your boss.

714
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,560
I asked you out today

715
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,679
as a fishing buddy.

716
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:13,999
If you do so, I won't

717
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,880
dare to ask you out next time.

718
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,560
Alright.

719
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,600
I'll go first.

720
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,560
Yes.

721
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,199
See you, sir.

722
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,959
Be careful when driving.

723
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,279
Okay.

724
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,519
See you, sir.

725
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,439
I'm going home.

726
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,840
Going home.

727
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:44,719
Hello.

728
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,479
Hello, Xiaoning.

729
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,800
Is your party over?

730
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,959
I'll pick you up now.

731
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,519
No. I'm okay.

732
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,719
I'll just go back myself.

733
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,160
It's so late,

734
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,759
and it's easy for me to pick you up.

735
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:54,880
No, really.

736
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,479
You can't be seen now.

737
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,239
Besides, Ling Weiyi's drunk.

738
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:58,999
I'm taking her home first.

739
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,919
Got to go.

740
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,800
"Can't be seen".

741
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,759
Hello, dad.

742
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,519
It's me.

743
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:15,439
Do you know

744
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,519
where Ling Weiyi

745
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:16,999
lives?

746
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,439
I need to pick up Xiaoning there.

747
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,679
Could you send me the address?

748
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,160
Here comes the cab.

749
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:23,759
Okay.

750
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,679
The cab's here.

751
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:25,959
Here.

752
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:29,679
There.

753
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,120
Mind your head.

754
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:31,479
Take it easy.

755
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,199
Thanks for getting us a cab.

756
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,360
We can go back ourselves.

757
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,160
Don't bother.

758
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,160
It's too late.

759
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,040
It's not safe for you girls to go alone.

760
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:42,640
I'll escort you.

761
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,880
I'll tell you what.

762
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,840
Gosh.

763
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,360
Xing City is just

764
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,679
too unprincipled.

765
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,239
Unlike me.

766
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,320
You can drop us off here.

767
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,120
I'm different.

768
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,959
Thanks for the escort.

769
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,160
-Thanks. -You can go now.

770
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,400
Well,

771
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,560
she's too drunk.

772
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,360
How about I...

773
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,320
Sorry. Sorry.

774
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,439
You okay?

775
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,840
Why don't you take your coat off?

776
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,800
I'll give it back after I wash it.

777
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,759
If you'll bring it over.

778
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:18,840
Sure.

779
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,560
I'll call a deliveryman.

780
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,120
I'd rather not, then.

781
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:26,840
You'd better go now.

782
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm afraid she would

783
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,439
throw up on you again.

784
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,840
Okay.

785
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,320
Well, be careful.

786
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,040
Okay, okay.

787
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,800
Don't let her throw up on you.

788
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,160
Okay, okay.

789
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,719
Be careful.

790
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:34,759
Take it easy.

791
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:35,519
Be careful.

792
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,360
Thanks for today.

793
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,239
Thanks.

794
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,080
I knew you did it on purpose.

795
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:44,840
I'm just

796
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,040
throwing up

797
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,160
on the garbage.

798
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,800
Here.

799
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,080
Drink with me.

800
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:16,759
So that's why

801
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,880
I can't be seen.

802
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,640
Xiaoning.

803
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,160
I won't leave for a while.

804
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,919
Call me if you need anything.

805
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,679
I'm being kicked out now.

806
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,239
It'd be embarrassing if people saw me.

807
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,560
Another one from Dairui.

808
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,679
Now I can't come out any more.

809
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:43,439
Weiyi.

810
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,959
I'm on your doorstep.

811
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:46,400
Call me if you need anything.

812
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:54,999
Let's drink!

813
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,160
More?

814
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,919
Don't drink too much.

815
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,080
Just a little bit.

816
00:29:59,199 --> 00:29:59,679
Here.

817
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,479
Drink with me.

818
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,360
He promised

819
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:13,919
he would make

820
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,840
video calls for at least

821
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,759
an hour a day.

822
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,439
You were there.

823
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,080
You're the witness.

824
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,080
But then?

825
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,199
It's just like

826
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,800
what I said.

827
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,759
A long-distance

828
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,959
relationship is an illusion.

829
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,679
It's worse for two in different countries.

830
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,360
At least

831
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,160
you two had a graceful breakup.

832
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,120
But me?

833
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:37,719
I was dumped.

834
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,400
Right.

835
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:43,279
You're worse.

836
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,279
No.

837
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,919
I'm worse.

838
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,040
You see,

839
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,519
the fact that

840
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,679
Lu Sijing is an asshole

841
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,840
is as obvious as the Moon tonight.

842
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,279
It's so clear

843
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,320
and leaves no illusions.

844
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,120
You knew it's the end immediately.

845
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,519
But Qi Yu?

846
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,640
He's always looking miserable

847
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,560
before and after

848
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,239
the breakup.

849
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,719
It always

850
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:17,080
makes me feel...

851
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
I thought

852
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,759
I was

853
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,880
recovered

854
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,400
and ready

855
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,279
for another relationship,

856
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,679
but he just suddenly showed up.

857
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Is he kidding me?

858
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,479
Alright.

859
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,999
Stop being upset.

860
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,479
What?

861
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,959
No more alcohol.

862
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,120
What?

863
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,479
Are you crying?

864
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,360
Alright, alright.

865
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,759
Don't cry.

866
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,439
Don't cry. Don't cry.

867
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,999
Don't cry. Don't cry.

868
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,759
Xiaoning,

869
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:08,199
If I'm so rich

870
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,040
and I'm not happy,

871
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,120
who in the world

872
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,959
is happy?

873
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,880
Don't cry.

874
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:19,919
You're going to be happy.

875
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,160
The men.

876
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,759
There are men

877
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,880
all over the world.

878
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,320
Don't be upset by them.

879
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,400
Xiaoning,

880
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,439
when will I forget him?

881
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,719
Every time he shows up,

882
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,239
I remember

883
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,959
the first time we met.

884
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,239
You're the Ling

885
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,120
who ordered for

886
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,679
a 3-step layup coach?

887
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,679
Interesting.

888
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,239
It's the first time I see someone

889
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,919
hotter than the flattering photo.

890
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,800
You're Fu?

891
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,439
Fu Lei is my roommate.

892
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:01,880
He's busy. He asked me to teach you.

893
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,080
Don't worry.

894
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,840
I'm an

895
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,519
athletic student.

896
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:05,479
I'm Qi Yu.

897
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
I'll take care of your

898
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,120
optional course of P.E.

899
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,439
You try one first and I'll see.

900
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:11,640
Okay.

901
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,040
I'll try first.

902
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:13,719
Okay.

903
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,239
How's that?

904
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
The 3 steps of yours

905
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:27,519
were pretty random.

906
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,919
I wouldn't need you if I were an expert.

907
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,999
Show me.

908
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,519
3-step layup

909
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,560
is one...

910
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,320
You're no better than me.

911
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:41,679
Wait a sec.

912
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,199
I'm infected by you.

913
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:44,919
Your influence is too strong.

914
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:45,959
I'll show you a proper one.

915
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:01,080
How's that?

916
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,160
Isn't it easy?

917
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,719
Qi Yu.

918
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:12,880
He took

919
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
three steps

920
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
straight into my heart.

921
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,279
Your relationship

922
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,040
has been a bit of a drama

923
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,520
from the start.

924
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,600
Really.

925
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,040
It's not an order for basketball training.

926
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,160
It's an order for romance.

927
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,799
Or tragic romance.

928
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,319
Teach me how to do it.

929
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,799
How can I pretend

930
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,759
he doesn't exist

931
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
when I see Qi Yu

932
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,000
like you did with Lu Sijing?

933
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,679
Teach me.

934
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,960
When the day comes

935
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,319
that you don't love him anymore

936
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,839
you won't feel bad

937
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,679
and can pretend he doesn't exist.

938
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,080
Maybe

939
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,279
I have to wait for someone

940
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,359
like Ji Yuheng to show up, too.

941
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,359
No.

942
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,799
It doesn't matter if he

943
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:01,920
shows up.

944
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,480
It's up to you.

945
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,719
You're upset because

946
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,199
you still have feelings

947
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,080
for Qi Yu.

948
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:17,399
By the way.

949
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,399
Have you made up

950
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,359
with Ji Yuheng?

951
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,920
It reminds me of my mom's thoughts.

952
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,120
She said,

953
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:27,279
marriage is about

954
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,000
putting two

955
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,080
different people

956
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,480
in a room and letting them

957
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,199
bond with each other.

958
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,600
We're

959
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,560
in a relationship for marriage.

960
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:36,759
I've decided

961
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,560
to get to know him

962
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,399
again,

963
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,239
trying to

964
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,239
get used to the life with him faster.

965
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,160
It doesn't sound right.

966
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,279
If you're

967
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,319
in a relationship for marriage,

968
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,920
you have to be in love.

969
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,920
You need to feel the love.

970
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,120
Love him!

971
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,560
You need to love him!

972
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,719
Love is something

973
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:00,960
that can't be found.

974
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,719
We can just be in the relationship.

975
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,679
Maybe one day we can feel

976
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:05,679
the love for each other.

977
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,440
Right?

978
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,640
I'm waiting downstairs.

979
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
I don't think they'll run into each other.

980
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:53,679
It's been all night.

981
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,799
They must be long gone.

982
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,560
The bottle's running out of water.

983
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:34,640
You didn't really

984
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:36,239
wait out there all night,

985
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,279
did you?

986
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,000
I wanted to

987
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,679
go upstairs,

988
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:41,799
but I saw someone

989
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,080
waiting down there

990
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,319
and someone just coming down.

991
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:47,239
I did know

992
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,120
I can't be seen.

993
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,920
So I had to wait there.

994
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,920
Are you talking about Lu Sijing?

995
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,879
He's just worried

996
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:54,679
that I couldn't bring

997
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:55,719
Ling Weiyi home.

998
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,080
He insisted on escorting us.

999
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:57,879
But we

1000
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,319
got rid of him quickly.

1001
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:01,279
Ling Weiyi threw up all over him.

1002
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:05,560
But seriously.

1003
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,000
If this happens again,

1004
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
you'll have to let me pick you up,

1005
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,160
even if I don't show up.

1006
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,040
You can

1007
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,839
pretend you take a cab.

1008
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,359
Are you tired?

1009
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:20,839
How about

1010
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:22,759
I drive?

1011
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,759
Never mind.

1012
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,679
I can do this.

1013
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:26,359
You can

1014
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,319
talk to me.

1015
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,120
It's a good time

1016
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,560
to talk about

1017
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,759
the members in Section 1 of BDD.

1018
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,920
You were the lobby manager before,

1019
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,520
you've seen more people.

1020
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
You know people better than I do.

1021
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,799
You're trying to

1022
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,920
probing for information,

1023
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,359
aren't you?

1024
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,080
Just say something

1025
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,359
that doesn't violate

1026
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,799
your team rule.

1027
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:51,920
Let me know a little bit.

1028
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,440
The ones with

1029
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,799
the most clients in Section 1

1030
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,160
are definitely Jing and Fanggang.

1031
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,279
But they have

1032
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,399
completely different styles.

1033
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,759
Jing is

1034
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,839
very experienced in doing things

1035
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,399
in a vigorous

1036
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,239
and courageous manner.

1037
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,080
If she says it can be done,

1038
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,160
it can be done.

1039
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,040
We have

1040
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,399
rolled out an integrated payroll card service

1041
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:13,160
for individual payroll agents.

1042
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,359
I know that your hospital

1043
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:15,080
works a lot with

1044
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,960
out-of-town hospitals.

1045
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,399
So, in addition to

1046
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,560
basic services,

1047
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:19,920
we can also offer you

1048
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,199
a discounted service

1049
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,399
of 12 off-site withdrawals per year.

1050
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,679
And we have a green channel

1051
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,960
for personal loans.

1052
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:29,759
Mr. Liu.

1053
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,799
I am sure

1054
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,160
you will choose our bank

1055
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,719
after reading this information.

1056
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,000
Because of her professionalism,

1057
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,839
precise judgment of the market,

1058
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,160
and keen insight,

1059
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,000
she can

1060
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,279
give her clients

1061
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:43,359
both professional advice

1062
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,480
and

1063
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,600
a sense of security.

1064
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,560
But it's risky

1065
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,319
for a banker

1066
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,160
to sway a client.

1067
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:52,640
Jing doesn't have

1068
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:54,000
any bad debts.

1069
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,199
Go on.

1070
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,000
As for Fanggang,

1071
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,440
he's completely different.

1072
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,719
He can

1073
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,080
become good friends

1074
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,839
with his clients.

1075
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,920
His clients trust him.

1076
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,359
Good news!

1077
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,879
The loan will be approved next week.

1078
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:16,960
Bro,

1079
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,199
it's hard

1080
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,239
to apply for a loan.

1081
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,199
Save your money

1082
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:21,080
and don't waste it

1083
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
on dinner for me.

1084
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:23,920
Okay, I'll call you tonight.

1085
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,399
I've got

1086
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,319
a call coming in.

1087
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,399
Okay.

1088
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:27,199
Bye-bye.

1089
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:30,679
Li! My sis!

1090
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,679
How could I forget

1091
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,679
little Qi's birthday?

1092
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,719
Sure.

1093
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,000
Whatever you want.

1094
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,839
From what you're saying,

1095
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:40,000
it sounds to me like he's mingling

1096
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,359
private and company's interest.

1097
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,440
"Mingling"?

1098
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,239
Mr. Ji.

1099
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,040
He's just making friends.

1100
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,960
It's not like

1101
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,000
making friends is

1102
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,239
a dishonest practice.

1103
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,480
If he was

1104
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,759
gaining personal profit,

1105
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,000
you'd have found him out,

1106
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,160
wouldn't you?

1107
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,520
Good point.

1108
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,560
Making friends

1109
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,679
is fine.

1110
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,839
Excuse me.

1111
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,560
Is there an antidote for alcohol?

1112
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:35,600
No, sorry.

1113
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,279
It's in the pharmacy next door.

1114
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,199
But they don't start

1115
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,120
till 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1116
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,040
8:00 a.m.

1117
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:41,399
Thank you.

1118
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,839
Thank you.
